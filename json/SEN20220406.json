Mr. Speaker, Taoiseach, dear Senators and Members of the Parliament, dear people of Ireland, this night our territory was again hit by Russian missiles.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">President Zelenskyy:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was done cunningly and it hit civilian infrastructure.  The new fuel storage depot was hit.  This is viewed by Russia as a target.  This is their attribute.  They are destroying things that are sustaining livelihoods to people.  They are hitting places where we store fuel, food storage depots, agricultural equipment and fields.  They are putting mines into the fields.  They have also blocked all of our seaports, together with the vessels that already had agricultural cargos for export.  Why are they doing this?  Because for them, hunger is also a weapon &mdash; a weapon against us ordinary people as an instrument of domination.  Ukraine is one of the leading food-supplying countries in the world.  This is not just about the deficit and the threat of hunger for more than dozens of countries, Asia and Africa; it is about even more because there will be a shortage of food and the prices will go up.  This is reality for millions of people who are hungry.  It will be more difficult for them to feed their families, especially in north Africa.<\/p><p>They are undermining our seeding time, they are destroying our infrastructure and they are deliberately provoking the food crisis.  What will happen as the result of this crisis?  At the least, there will be political turbulence.  At a maximum, there will be binges of violence and new refugees looking to save their lives.  Russia is using this hunger weapon.<\/p><p>The worst thing is the city of Mariupol.  This city of 500,000 inhabitants was put under siege and Russia has blocked access from the soil and from the sea.  They are blocking the humanitarian cargo.  They are not allowing anything to come through, neither water nor medication.  While it was snowing, people could melt the snow to get water.  Now they do not have even that.<\/p><p>They are bombing 24-7.  There are air strikes and bombings in Mariupol.  There is no single house left intact in a city of half a million.  None.  The dead and killed were simply buried in the yards of the condominiums.  In many cases, they could not even do that: the bodies were just left there lying on the streets and in the remnants of the buildings and basements.  We do not know how many citizens of Mariupol have been killed by Russia, but we know for sure this was part of general occupation tactics.  They have done the same or they have attempted to do the same with the cities of Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Izyum, Volnovakha and many other Ukrainian cities.  Maybe you have not heard those geographic names yet but this is about millions of people that Russia has been continually trying to destroy.<\/p><p>When you hear these things, it may seem that this is not possible.  It may seem that none in the present-day world would dare to do that, but these are real facts.  The fact is that Mariupol citizens were drawing the maps of how to find the bodies of the dead who were buried in their yards.  The fact is that Russian occupants were killing people on the roads when they were trying to escape.  They blocked cities.  Until today on the Ukrainian highways we have hundreds of shot in burned cars.  The fact is that Russian soldiers were not even trying to take these bodies out of the streets.  While Bucha and Irpin were under occupation, these dead bodies were simply lying on the streets, on the sideways, in the yards of the houses, anywhere.  The fact is that in the 42 days of the all-out Russian war, at least 167 children have been killed in Ukraine.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">President Zelenskyy:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We do not yet know all the atrocities of Mariupol and the victims in all the areas of Ukraine where the fighting is still going on.  The fact is that, as a result of Russian shelling, 927 educational institutions and 258 hospitals were damaged.  The Russians even shot at 78 ambulances.  They were targeting even churches and shelters where they knew for sure there was nobody but women and children.  This is a fact.<\/p><p>The country that is doing this does not deserve to be in the circle of civilised countries.  It should be held responsible for everything it has done on Ukrainian soil.  The Russians have come to Ukraine as a colonising army.  Their state protagonists and their politicians are not even concealing what they want.  In the 21st century, they are looking at their country as a colonial empire which allegedly has the right to subdue neighbouring people, destroy the foundations of their independent life and destroy their identity, everything that makes us Ukrainians.  Russian soldiers were deliberately looking for and killing teachers in the occupied districts.  They are abducting local government leaders and they are killing community leaders.  Together with the Russian army, there were special groups coming in who were trying to destroy any political opposition.<\/p><p>Now, when we are hearing new rhetoric about the sanctions against the Russian opposition, I cannot tolerate any indecisiveness after everything we have gone through in Ukraine and after everything that Russian troops have done.  Today, when the world knows about the crimes against our people, we still have to convince even some European companies to abandon the Russian market.  We still have to convince foreign politicians that we need to cut any ties of Russian banks with the global financial system.  We still have to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine with new sources of funding.<\/p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Ireland have been supporting good and have been supporting Ukraine since the very first days.  This is a fact.  They did not doubt starting to help us; they began doing this right away.  Although Ireland is a neutral country, it has not remained neutral to the disaster and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine.  I am grateful to every citizen of Ireland.  Thank you for supporting sanctions against Russia, thank you for the humanitarian and financial support extended to our country and thank you for your care of our Ukrainian people who found shelter on your land.  Think about the fact that, as of today, 10 million Ukrainians have been left without shelter by Russia.  They had to leave their native cities because of this war.  This is something we cannot come to grips with.  It means that Russia has not yet abandoned its plans.  It is still looking to subdue and occupy all the Ukrainian people.<\/p><p>We want you to help us to make sure that Russia will start looking for peace and leave us alone.  I ask you to show more leadership in our anti-war coalition.  I ask you to convince EU partners to introduce even more rigid sanctions against Russia that would really make sure that the Russian war machine will stop.  We have to put an end to trading with Russia.  We have to cut the ties of Russian banks to the global system and cut the sources of their income from oil that they use for their weapons and for killing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">President Zelenskyy:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are mechanisms through which this can be done.  The only thing we are lacking is a principled approach from some political and business leaders who still think war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses.  I am sure Ireland's leadership can make a difference and change this.  I am sure that the whole of Europe will be able to stop this war and bring peace and stability to the east of Europe.  We cannot delay any longer.  The longer Russia's aggression continues, the worse the consequences will be not only for our Continent, but for neighbouring regions.  <br\/><br\/>I say to Members and to the people of Ireland that our principled approach and courage have already turned a new page in the relationship between Ukraine and Ireland.  Our mutual understanding and mutual respect is already at a level whereby it is only a question of time before we can start living in a common European home.  Thank you for Ireland's support for the accelerated procedure to provide membership of the EU to Ukraine.  With your support, the process will be even faster and beneficial to both our nations.  We need to start thinking about the restoration of our country after the war.  We are inviting leading countries of the world to participate in rebuilding and restoring Ukraine.  Of course, Ireland is always welcome to participate, for example, in Kherson Oblast.  Ireland is known for its skill in valueing lives, its community development experience and its economic potential.  Let us bring our efforts together and show that, jointly, Ukraine and Ireland can do much more than the biggest country in the world was trying to destroy.  I am grateful to Ireland.  <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Last Tuesday at the Conference of Speakers of the European Union Parliaments in Ljubljana I called upon the 450 members of the Duma to shoulder their responsibility.  The law of averages suggests that among the 450 members of that Parliament there must be people who can see through the lies, fake news, propaganda and manipulation.  They must now find their courage - courage that the Ukrainian people demonstrate daily.  They must speak up, speak out, take their courage and reject the leadership they currently have.<\/p><p>There are 143 million Russian people populating that country.  Again, the law of averages tells us that many of those people must be fine, decent and honourable people who have a respect for human rights.  President Zelenskyy, your people are being asked to show courage that goes beyond the bounds of human endurance.  Please God, the people of Russia will now find their courage to also reject what is being done wrongly and devastatingly in their name.<\/p><p>In conclusion, Mr. President, thank you for honouring us and joining us today.

We thank President Zelenskyy for his heartfelt, honest, clear and, indeed, historic address to our Parliament this morning.  The strength of his commitment and that of the people of Ukraine to his country and to restoring its place as a free, safe, democratic and an independent country within the community of nations is both humbling and uplifting.<\/p> <p>We heard grave testimony from President Zelenskyy this morning and we have seen ourselves the most shocking and harrowing of images from Bucha, from Irpin, from Mariupol and from across Ukraine.  Russia will have to live with the shame and ignominy of what it has done in Ukraine for generations.  Those responsible will be held to account.   We are with Ukraine and I am certain that, in the end, Ukraine will prevail.<\/p> <p>We are a militarily neutral country.  However, we are not politically or morally neutral in the face of war crimes.  Quite the opposite.  Our position is informed by the principles that drive our foreign policy &ndash; support for international human rights, for humanitarian law and for a rules-based international order.  We are not neutral when Russia disregards all of these principles.  We are with Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Ukraine&rsquo;s political, economic and humanitarian needs are now manifold and pressing.  Our efforts, as a friend and as a partner of Ukraine, are aimed at using all the levers at our disposal to bring a just end to this war - applying international pressure on Russia, pursuing accountability for violations of international law and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught now in the midst of this terrible and immoral war.<\/p> <p>Thousands of people have been killed.  Millions have been driven from their homes.  This is a humanitarian crisis the likes of which Europe has not seen since the dark years of the Second World War.   This war touches us all.  That is why Ireland is supporting further European Union sanctions at European level.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=693\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=693&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need a sanctions regime that brings it home to Putin and his regime that he will not, he cannot, succeed.  We want the strongest possible sanctions against the Russian Federation and we will pursue those.<\/p><p>That is why we support the establishment of a solidarity trust fund for Ukraine, agreed by European Union leaders when we met in Brussels on 24 March, to support the Government of Ukraine now, and when the war is over to support reconstruction.<\/p><p>That is why I welcome and support Ukraine's application for EU membership.  I reiterate our support for that application this morning in this House.  It is the democratic right of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to decide your political orientation.  You have chosen to apply for European Union membership.<\/p><p>We know that EU enlargement has been a force for stabilisation and democratisation in the European Union&rsquo;s neighbourhood.  It is in the European Union&rsquo;s strategic interest.  It is in Ukraine&rsquo;s interest.  As I said to you, President Zelenskyy, when we spoke on 16 March, I will continue to support Ukraine&rsquo;s case.  That is why also we have committed &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian funding, delivered through proven international agencies active on the ground and we will do more.  This is to meet the urgent needs of those in need in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries - including shelter, medical care, health, water and sanitation.<\/p><p>As well as financial support, through a collaborative effort, we are in the process of delivering medical equipment, including ambulances, ultrasound machines, mobile X-ray machines, ventilators, and incubators.  On 26 and 28 March, two despatches of urgently required medical equipment left Ireland and more will follow.  That is why Ireland has contributed our full share to the European peace facility&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion military assistance package for Ukraine.  We have also supplied provisions and body armour to the Ukrainian military.  We will also continue to support any avenue that can lead to an immediate ceasefire.<\/p><p>In light of what is being revealed in the areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn, that task will now be even more difficult.  I therefore especially commend your commitment, President Zelenskyy, to continuing to try, despite the enormous challenges you face.  Please know that we are with you in that task, and that we stand ready to contribute to and to support any initiative that can lead to a just peace for the people of Ukraine.<\/p><p>I know that the people of Mariupol cannot wait for talks to conclude.  Their needs are too urgent.  We need to see genuine humanitarian corridors opened and implemented.  Ireland, along with our partners, will continue to support any sincere efforts at the United Nations to ensure safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance.<\/p><p>Thousands of Ukrainians have arrived in Ireland since the start of the conflict.  A Cheann Comhairle, if I may, I address these words to them.  I know that the ambassador of Ukraine, H.E. Ms Larysa Gerasko, is here in the Gallery for today&rsquo;s debate.  To those who have arrived here from Ukraine, I hope you find in Ireland safe harbour and friendship for as long as you need it.  Most of you, I know, look forward to the day when you can return to a peaceful and free Ukraine, to the family and friends you have left behind.  That day will come.  In the meantime, our home is your home.<\/p><p>The war in Ukraine has sparked a crisis the likes of which we have not seen in Europe for decades.  It is no surprise to me that the Irish people have stood up to be counted in an unprecedented way in response.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=693\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=693&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Over 18,000 Ukrainian people have arrived in Ireland.

New arrivals are also being registered to ensure that they can access income supports as needed.  The heartfelt response of people across Ireland is clear in the whole range of initiatives at community level.  I would like to thank all of the people who have opened their hearts and, in some cases, their homes to people from Ukraine.  <br\/><br\/>President Zelenskyy, when you addressed the European Parliament you said, &quot;life will win over death, and light will win over darkness&quot;.

As a country, we are heartbroken watching the scenes we see on television every night.  We are heartbroken to see what the people of Ukraine have had to endure for 42 days.

The words he spoke then are just as relevant today.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAnd no nation, large or small, can be indifferent to the fate of others, near or far.

It is in that spirit that the Irish people have opened and will open their doors to provide sanctuary and shelter for women and children in particular fleeing conflict while their men stay at home.  It is going to be difficult and challenging beyond compare, which we all know, but we are committed to this work.<\/p> <p>I will quote one of the other leaders who has spoken here, former Chancellor Kohl of Germany.  In addressing this House he said we are \"European by conviction\" and that is true.  It is our conviction as a small State and nation that allows us to strengthen when we work in co-operation and collaboration with European colleagues.  It is appropriate today to quote two lines from the preamble of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs this relationship.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eamon Ryan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It states that the signatories are:<\/p><blockquote>\tINTENDING to confirm the solidarity which binds Europe and the overseas countries and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, [and]<br \/><br \/>RESOLVED by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts... <\/blockquote><p>We heard today that just such a call has come from the people of a European nation to be part of those efforts.

It should not be constrained.  It will be stronger when we spread those democratic ideals.<br\/><br\/>I will quote one last person, Nelson Mandela, who spoke here so eloquently after he had reached and achieved his freedom.  He said: &quot;Nothing can stop the evolution of humanity towards the condition of greater and ever-expanding freedom&quot;.  He went on to say: &quot;We ask that you stay the course with us, we need your support for the democratic perspectives that we represent.&quot;  On that call for support for democratic systems, our European democratic system is absolutely founded in realising that it requires us to follow the rule of law, with all the conflicts, contradictions, complexities and compromises that sometimes involves.  That is what we are standing up here for today and what we need to do.  It may take time.  We have to answer what Nelson Mandela called for us to do - to be willing to stay the course in the face of other challenges that it will present, as we stop the use of those fossil fuels and provide our homes, schools, healthcare and other social services.  Staying the course will be difficult, but I expect this House and our people are up for that challenge, one of the greatest of our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#J00700","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Uachtar&aacute;n Zelenskyy as ucht a &oacute;r&aacute;id ar maidin.

I want to pay them a particular commendation for their work in these very trying times.<\/p> <p>We have heard directly from President Zelenskyy, in the rawest, most harrowing and heartbreaking of terms, testimony of the vicious war crimes committed by the Russian military in Ukraine.  We have been set a challenge.  Innocent civilians have been executed with their arms tied behind their backs.  There have been horrific accounts of rape and torture and the brutalisation by the powerful of vulnerable ordinary citizens in their war-torn country.  These are crime against the Ukrainian people and these are crimes against humanity.  Russia must be held accountable for its barbarism, and justice must be done.  These human rights violations and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention demand investigation by the International Criminal Court and prosecutions to follow.  The truth is that Russia has turned its back on dialogue and peace.  For 42 days and nights, it has chosen war.  It has chosen brutality.  It has chosen the violation of international law.  Russia has closed the door on dialogue and through its criminal actions it has thus far rejected avenues for diplomacy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Lou McDonald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2298\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2298&amp;amp;pid=MaryLouMcDonald&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Far from demonstrating a willingness to engage in peace negotiations, Russia has escalated its ferocious violence through the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.<\/p><p>All the while, however, the Russian Embassy in Ireland and Ambassador Yury Filatov have acted as unwavering and unapologetic propagandists for his country's illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Yesterday, in the face of evidence of Russian war crimes in Bucha and other areas surrounding Kyiv, the embassy and the ambassador claimed that this evidence was fabricated. They described it as another stage of the disinformation war against Russia.  This shameful response demonstrates the depths to which the Putin regime will stoop to justify the savagery of Russia's military aggression.  The Russian ambassador wants us to ignore the evidence before our very eyes.  Well, Mr. Filatov, we have heard the accounts of murders carried out by your soldiers reported by numerous credible sources.  We have seen the aerial photographs of human remains left scattered by the side of the road.  We have seen the cars carrying white flags, indicating civilian passengers, riddled with shrapnel.  The evidence of such atrocities condemns Russia before the world, and the world will not turn a blind eye.  It is long past time for Ambassador Filatov to be expelled from Ireland.

Yesterday Lithuania became the first EU member state to expel its Russian ambassador.  It did so as an action to uphold human rights and justice.  I commend Lithuania on that and believe our country should follow suit.  That would be a most powerful action for us to take as a militarily neutral, non-aligned State as we too stand for human rights and justice.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to act now.<\/p><p>Of course, we must do more.  The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine.  We strongly support Ukraine's stated desire to join the European Union.  We must respond to the humanitarian crisis by providing refuge to those fleeing for their lives.  As an elected member of the UN Security Council, we must use every available avenue to press for the de-escalation of conflict, for a ceasefire, for dialogue and for a Russian withdrawal and an end to this terrible war.<\/p><p>Ireland supports economic sanctions against Russia.  We must intensify those sanctions.  We should not have to convince anybody of the need to hit the Russian elites and oligarchs in every possible way.  The revelations of these war crimes and atrocities demand such an intensification of sanctions.  I welcome the announcement by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, of a new round of measures, including the ban on the import of Russian coal, the transaction ban on four Russian banks and the ban on Russian vessels from EU ports.  The impact of these sanctions creates a real economic challenge for Ireland and across the EU, but Russia and Vladimir Putin must feel the full weight and consequences of this invasion.  Russia should not doubt our resolve or our solidarity with the beleaguered people of Ukraine, a people who, as we speak, fight for their lives, fight for their freedom and fight for the survival of their nation.  They fight a war of liberation from tyranny and for the right to endure and to go on, and they will.  We know that a nation is a living, breathing thing.

Putin has not increased Russia's prestige or its power on the world stage.  His despotic leadership has sapped its influence, destroyed its economy and turned Russia into a pariah state.  It will remain a pariah state as long as Putin remains in power.<\/p> <p>Thursday, 24 February 2022, the day Russia launched its barbaric and illegal invasion of Ukraine, is the date that will live in infamy.  Since then, the Ukrainian people have faced a relentless barrage of bombs, bullets, missiles, mortars and rockets.  War crimes have been committed on a daily basis.  Maternity hospitals, schools, care homes and residential buildings have all been targeted.  They have tried to wipe whole cities, such as Mariupol, off the map.  The latest horrors revealed in Bucha, the torture and summary execution of hundreds of innocent civilians, are a gross affront to all of our collective humanity.<\/p> <p>Ireland stands united with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people against this callous barbarism and depravity.

While Russia is starved of economic support, financial support from the international community must flow into Ukraine.  What Putin has destroyed, Ukraine's allies must help to rebuild.

Putin is undoubtedly guilty of war crimes for his unjustified invasion of Ukraine, but so also is the United States, the UK and some of their allies for their unjustified wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which they have never been held accountable.  They are also guilty of supporting the Israeli state, which has been indicted recently for crimes against humanity for its treatment of the Palestinian people by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.  They are also guilty of supporting the Saudi dictatorship in its brutal war in Yemen, arming that regime and blocking attempts to investigate their crimes against humanity.  <\/p><p>We have no credibility in condemning, as we must, the crimes against humanity in Ukraine if we do not simultaneously oppose, condemn and demand accountability for all crimes against humanity, whether they are in Ukraine, Georgia, Afghanistan, Palestine or Yemen.  We will not eliminate crimes against humanity, warmongering or imperialism by being selective in our opposition to it.

It has yet to be decided and it will be determined not just by fate but by decisions and actions of the people in this Chamber over the next few days.

For many hundreds of years geography was not our friend in Ireland; now it is, as we sit on the western flank of the EU, part of the greatest peace project ever.  In that context I strongly support EU membership for Ukraine.  As a former member of the European Parliament I met many Ukrainians who looked to the EU as a place where they belonged and I know Ireland supports that stance.  It would be beyond selfish of us to share in the benefits and security of EU membership, yet deny it to the Ukrainian people. <\/p><p>To all Ukrainians, I say we have an old tradition in Ireland of lighting a candle in the window of our homes to show hospitality and welcome to the stranger.  Metaphorically speaking, many tens of thousands of those candles have been lit and are burning in Irish homes and hearts as we welcome Ukrainians fleeing war and terror into our homes and our communities.  I am wearing a Sligo badge below my badge depicting the Irish and Ukrainian flags as a symbol of our common humanity and connectedness, as we welcome more than 130 Ukrainians to Sligo in these days.<\/p><p>The huge fundraising efforts and the massive mobilisation of medical and other supplies to Ukraine continue day after day.  Government assistance coupled with a massive voluntary effort has forged a chain between Ireland and Ukraine and I believe those strong links will hold.  I believe Ireland will not be found wanting in strongly promoting and supporting humanitarian and peace initiatives, because all wars must end and our focus must be with the Ukrainian people in finding a pathway to a lasting peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#QQQQ00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Anois chun suimi&uacute; a thabhairt ar ghn&oacute; stairi&uacute;il na maidine, glaoim ar Chathaoirleach an tSeanaid, an Seanad&oacute;ir Mark Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#QQQQ00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>On behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I ask colleagues to join me in welcoming five-year-old Anastasia to the Parliament of our Republic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">An Cathaoirleach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--><i>Laskavo prosymo do Irlandiyi<\/i>.

In a previous address in this Chamber nearly 60 years ago, another President also acknowledged Irish neutrality but also acknowledged that Ireland is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be.  That is as true today as it was over half a century ago.  As an international community, we must never be neutral in the face of tyranny.  We work better when we work together.  We can and we must do more.  We must be relentless in our support for Ukraine, not just today, not just tomorrow, but until the war is won.

I pay compliment to our Cathaoirleach who attended and the Ceann Comhairle.  It was an emotional occasion that captured the Ireland&rsquo;s feeling about Ukrainians and their coming to Ireland and the need for us to do more.  As a society and a people, we need to do what we can to help Ukrainians in their hour of need.<\/p> <p>I compliment the President of Ukraine on his absolutely wonderful address.  It was powerful and emotional.  Given the pressure that man is under, it is simply amazing he found time to give such a wonderful performance of a speech.  He captured the hearts and souls of the Irish people with his performance.  If one listens to social media or anyone else, it was a wonderful display by a man under considerable pressure.  It is important this House acknowledges that and the wonderful contribution.  We are behind the Ukrainian people when it comes to the darkest day of their existence.<\/p> <p>With regard to other, more mundane matters, we need to broaden our debate about social media platforms and the control they have in our society.  We have considerable issues when it comes to Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms and how regulated or unregulated they are.<\/p> <p>I speak about young children in particular and the need for so-called time on the tablet.  It is becoming an epidemic in many places.  Many kids get up in the morning and the first thing they want is technology.  They want to know where the iPad or phone is.  We are all probably in that circle in our households but a debate is required about how we will make sure, going forward, our kids can interact with each other and with society rather than just interacting on social media platforms.  As children get older, there is the issue of how those social media platforms can be policed to make sure children are not being groomed and other unfortunate issues are not happening.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important we have a good, honest debate about how we are going to teach our children and society about the hazards of social media and the so-called technology.

The solidarity that was shown by the Members of both Houses reflects the solidarity of the people of this country.  The scenes we are seeing in Bucha and other parts of Ukraine are just horrific.  We need to continue to ensure that those who are responsible will be held to account.<\/p> <p>I raise the question of higher education funding again.  We are coming close to the anniversary of the publication of the Cassells report.  We have not yet seen the publication of the European Commission review which the Department commissioned.  It is not going to tell us anything we do not know.  It is going to tell us that our higher education funding system is in crisis and that institutions are struggling to provide the basic services for students and researchers.  It is essential this year that we address the question of core funding as well as the SUSI grant reform.  While I would favour a cut in student fees in an ideal world, there is a fear that if there was such a cut, the money lost to the institutions would not be made up by the Exchequer.  We have to ensure that the core funding grant issue is addressed.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said that it would have been addressed in 2021.  That has not been the case.  I have called for a debate on higher education funding.  We have discussed the matter at the education committee.  Nearly every witness who has come before that committee has said that priority has to be given to investing in core funding and reform of the SUSI grant scheme.  A cut to student fees will not benefit the most disadvantaged students because about 42% of new entrants do not have to pay fees anyway as they are in receipt of a student grant.  We have to ensure that the student grant is adequate.  I ask that we have a debate on the future of higher education funding.<\/p> <p>I hope colleagues will join me in extending congratulations to four students from Gorey Community School, Caoimhe Crean, Caoimhe Horan, Eoin Kelly and P&aacute;draig Kinsella, who won the 2022 certified Irish Angus schools competition.  They explored the environmental, ethical and economic benefits of the certified Irish Angus breed.  The interesting thing is that none of those four students come from a farming background.  They have an understanding of the breed and a love of agriculture.  It would be appropriate for this House to extend our congratulations to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#O00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Indeed we will.

We stand with Ukraine.<\/p> <p>The HSE is once again in the public eye as a result of plans to return greater decision-making abilities to regionally based authorities rather than top-level managers.  The plan of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is to set up six regional health authorities.  If this sounds familiar, it might be because we had regional health authorities 17 years ago.  They were done away with and replaced by the HSE as per the design of the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I hope that in another 17 years, centralisation is not tabled as a brand new solution to the systemic issue of bloat and bureaucracy which plagues our health system.<\/p> <p>More light needs to be shone on the HSE than perhaps the Department is willing to shed.  Monday saw coverage of an unreleased 2019 report which showed unsafe and unacceptable treatment in emergency care departments of nine separate HSE hospitals.  Some 50% or more of patients spent at least one night in the emergency department on a trolley before getting a bed or being discharged.  In at least one hospital they found patients spending up to ten nights on trolleys.  The report, Independent Review of Unscheduled Care Performance, was led by Professor Frank Keane, the former president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  It addressed issues of overcrowding, saying that the dignity, privacy and safety of patients on trolleys need attention.  Perhaps more worrying are the findings regarding leadership, staff and the communication between them as well as pervasive negative work practices.  Hospital staff did not always know who was in charge.  The adequacy of executive leadership and operational groups gave rise to concern and out-of-hours executive leadership commonly relied on tight rotas, often on a goodwill basis, which could promote burnout and become unsustainable.  Wards containing patients with a range of illnesses meant consultants and nurses were constantly moving around the building to find their patients.  The policy is any bed, anytime, anywhere, including mixed gender wards.<\/p> <p>Taken all together, it paints a stark picture of a healthcare service which has consistently fallen far below the standard expected of it, and whose senior management lacks any appetite for meaningful reform.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has had enough on his plate during the Covid pandemic, but now is the time to be proactive rather than reactive, and to create lasting change.  I hope we do not stop short of seeing it through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#O00500","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>In light of this morning's historic, powerful and emotive address from President Zelenskyy and at a time of increasing pressure on homeowners, businesses and farmers, it is crystal clear we must do everything we can to starve Russia from its fossil fuel funds.  One way we can do that is by increasing our rates of renewable energy production in any way we can.  Each of us has a potential role to play in this.  It can start very locally, on the rooftops of our homes in towns and villages across Ireland.<\/p> <p>I have had a lot of inquiries from homeowners, many of whom are already benefiting from solar PV panels on their homes, asking when they will be able to avail of a payment for the excess energy produced.  The answer is from this summer.  The specific timing will depend on their billing cycle.  Since 15 February, those who are generating excess energy from renewable microgeneration could be accruing credit.  Depending on their contract and utility company, payment for excess is set to begin in the coming months.  The clean export guarantee will allow customers with registered microgeneration devices to sell any excess electricity back to Ireland's electricity grid in return for payment.  Energy companies are currently announcing the tariffs they will offer.  This is a win-win for homeowners and renewables.  It allows families to reduce utility bills while being paid for excess energy.<\/p> <p>People can also avail of the SEAI microgeneration support scheme for domestic users, which opened in February.  This offers grants to help to install solar PV panels on homes.  I encourage all homeowners to explore whether it might work for them.  One barrier which is proving difficult is the current need for planning permission for solar panels on roofs.  This is something my Green Party colleagues in the Seanad have worked hard to move along.  I hope the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will move quickly to complete the legislative changes needed.  There is frustration which I share that similar schemes for non-domestic users such as schools and farms are taking longer.  I believe solar energy generated on farms in particular will play a very significant role in our transition away from fossil fuels.  I assure my colleagues in the Seanad that the Government is actively working on this issue.  The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities will consult on an implementation plan for the clean export premium tariff for larger non-domestic producers later this year.  A grant scheme for non-domestic users is due to commence this summer. <\/p> <p>In my own constituency, some public representatives have tried to claim the entire policy is failing miserably.  This is disappointing and untrue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We will solve the issue.

I did not take the opportunity to welcome the new artists' income scheme that has been announced.  A thriving cultural economy is built on the work of people from all backgrounds in our society who have the talent and the means to create art.  How do we ensure diversity in that cultural production in the face of rapidly declining incomes and rising property prices and insurance costs?  Not only are our artists poor, but they are getting poorer even as the cultural sector becomes more valuable.  The harder it is to live as a working artist, the more voices will be excluded from our cultural sector, the more culture will become a playground for people who have money and privilege, and the more it will support the inequalities of our society.  The first step towards making our cultural economy thriving and diverse is to make a creative career sustainable.  That is why it is very welcome that the Minister and her officials in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media have put in the work needed to deliver an income scheme.  It is something for which we have been calling for a number of years.  I commend the National Campaign for the Arts in particular on the work it has put in.  It is great to see this coming to fruition.  I commend the Minister on that.<\/p> <p>I note that Tourism Ireland invited Sacha Lord, the night-time economy adviser for greater Manchester, to be a member of a delegation as part of a link-up between Irish cities, Liverpool and Manchester.  It is good to see recognition of the importance of the night-time economy in our cities.  This is a step change in terms of Government policy and I again commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, on this.  We will all have seen reports at the weekend with regard to reform of opening hours and licensing laws.  Nightclubs need their own type of licence which is fit for purpose and workable and which will not involve the barriers to entry we see with regard to the pub industry.  There were 522 nightclubs in 2000.  There are now 85.  That shows the importance of the licensing law reform aspect of the work of the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  I would welcome a discussion in this House on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#P00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I also compliment the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle on this morning's joint sitting and on their statements in particular.  April is sexual assault awareness month.  As we know, rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes and breaches of international humanitarian law.  Women across Ukraine are grappling with the threat of rape as a weapon of war as growing evidence of sexual violence emerges from areas retaken from retreating Russian forces.  The world was horrified on Sunday by a picture taken by the photographer Mikhail Palinchak on a highway approximately 20 km outside of Kyiv in which the bodies of one man and three women were to be seen piled under a blanket.  The women were naked and their bodies had partially been burned.  These harrowing images add to a mounting body of evidence that summary executions, rape and torture have been used against civilians in areas under Russian control since the Kremlin launched its invasion on 24 February.  We heard at first hand from President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, about what is happening on the ground and the realities of the brutal Russian army.<\/p> <p>Particularly difficult for many of us to comprehend is the scale of the sexual violence.  As Russian troops have withdrawn from towns and suburbs around the capital to refocus their war efforts on the east, women and girls have come forward to tell the police, media and human rights organisations of atrocities they have suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers.  Gang rapes and assaults taking place at gunpoint and rapes committed in front of children are among the grim testimonies that have been collected by investigators.  The president of La Strada Ukraine, a charity that supports survivors of trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault, has said the charity has received several calls to their emergency hotline from women and girls seeking assistance but that, in most cases, it has been impossible physically to get to them.  We know rape is an under-reported crime and stigmatised even in peaceful and normal times, so what we are hearing about now is likely to be merely the tip of the iceberg.  There are also reports from one woman, Antonina Medvedchuk, who said that when she woke up to the sound of bombing, her first thought was to get scissors, condoms and contraception.  In between the bombs, she would go looking for emergency contraception rather than an emergency first aid kit.  We also need to think of the situation of people fleeing to Poland, where reproductive health services are impossible to access.  This is coming at women and children in Ukraine from every direction.<\/p> <p>We know the trauma caused by the use of rape as a military tactic will lead to deep suffering across Ukrainian society for years to come.  Rape, sexual assault and violence never leave you.  I know this to be all too true.  While there may be remedies in the future via the justice system or international courts for the war crime of rape, this will do little to provide comfort to the women and girls currently facing the reality of rape and sexual violence upon their bodies.  Women and children always feel the worst brunt of war and those in Ukraine are no different.  During this sexual assault awareness month, I think of the women and girls in Ukraine who are facing the most horrific of circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#P00300","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for bringing that important topic to our attention.

Some Ukrainian people have arrived recently.  A man was making a delivery there yesterday morning and there was a little boy of seven crying uncontrollably in the corner.  Out of curiosity, this man asked some of the Ukrainian people in charge who could speak English what was wrong.  He was told that the little boy's dad had been killed in the war the night before.  That struck me and really went to my heart.  The particular guy who was doing the delivery was also really struck down by it.  It really brings it home to you.

The services that are being provided in Dublin are very organised.  When people arrive in Dublin Airport, there is a one-stop-shop where they get their personal public service, PPS, numbers and everything else.  However, this is not as well organised down the country.  This must be raised.  The hub I mentioned is being run by St. Munchin's Community Centre and the centre knew where to go to access the services, how to make an appointment for people to get their PPS numbers and how to get their mobile telephones.  In addition, the centre is starting English language classes on Thursday.  There are many similar hubs in the Limerick area and there should be somebody in place to co-ordinate this fully.  In the Radisson Hotel there are almost 200 Ukrainians and they have received many supports, but they wonder whether they will learn English and if somebody is going to look after them.  The same support must be given in hubs around the country as is given in Dublin, and that is something I wish to raise.<\/p><p>Finally, there was a good news story in Limerick yesterday when the council took back control of King John's Castle.  I thank Shannon Group and Shannon Heritage for minding it for the past 25 years, but it is now back in the rightful ownership of Limerick City and County Council.  We look forward to welcoming the many tourists who will visit the castle.

Your empathy with people was remarkable, a Chathaoirligh, and I compliment you personally on that.  It was wonderful to see.<\/p> <p>There have been many fine words about the situation in Ukraine and we have provided some support to the people there.  I must say that I agree with my colleague, Deputy Berry.  We need to provide what weapons we have to allow them to defend themselves.  We have to come to terms with that, and fairly soon.<\/p> <p>I cannot let today pass without talking about the United Nations Security Council.  We lauded the winning of the seat, which I totally disagree with anyway.  The United Nations Security Council is sitting on its hands while, as we were told this morning, 10 million people have been forced to leave their homes in Ukraine.  If the United Nations Security Council cannot provide peace and cannot bring about peace enforcement in Ukraine, it is time to scrap that useless waffle shop.  We have seen wars all over the world and all we hear are fine words on what needs to be done, but nothing is ever done.  We see it on our television screens every day.  The United Nations Security Council is a waste of time as long as the permanent members have a veto.<\/p> <p>Today, my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, is bringing forward a Bill regarding the restriction of names with respect to the Defence Forces.  This is a test for all democrats in this House.  The use of the term &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann belongs to only one organisation in this country and I expect to see 100% cross-party support for that.  I compliment the Senator on bringing that Bill forward.<\/p> <p>Finally, I agree with what Senator Maria Byrne just said.  I have had telephone calls from around the country regarding people who have arrived here and, for example, only got a three-month visa.  One woman is absolutely petrified she will be gone in three months.  The Senator is 100% correct and I thank her for raising it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Q00800","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Like other Members, I compliment you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Ceann Comhairle on the historic address by President Zelenskyy to the Houses this morning.  This all started six weeks ago and it has been horrific to imagine what has happened.  I got a 16-year-old into a school and I have somebody else who is getting extra hours for English as an additional language.  It is happening on the ground in Ireland.  The Irish people, the State and all of us are doing everything we can, but it is an awful pity that all this destruction and wanton viciousness is allowed.  We all stand with the people of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>I welcome the most senior member of the Colombian Government ever to visit Ireland, the Colombian Vice President, Marta Luc&iacute;a Ram&iacute;rez.  She is the country's first female vice president as well as its foreign affairs minister.  She has been here since Monday and I understand she is flying out tomorrow.  I met her yesterday evening.  We have an excellent relationship with Colombia and long may that continue and improve.  It is worthy of the House to acknowledge her presence in this country.<\/p> <p>I wish to make three brief points.  Members of the transport committee visited Dublin Airport on Monday to understand the challenges it is going through.  It has approximately 600 security staff and needs to increase that to approximately 900.  The biggest problem it is having is Garda vetting and what is called enhanced background checks, which involves referring back to another jurisdiction if people have lived out of the State for more than six months.  The challenge is the Garda vetting system appears to be quite slow.<\/p> <p>There is also an issue with tourism generally in respect of work permits.  People in the hospitality sector have told me it is taking them ten months to get people work permits to work in their industry.  They are effectively turning away guests because they do not have enough staff to cope with them.<\/p> <p>Finally, there is the passports issue.  I am still getting, and I am sure this is the case for all Members, endless numbers of passport queries.  Sometimes it is the applicants' fault, but a lot of the time it is clogged up in the system.  The office could have a screening process where the initial passport application is looked at immediately and, if there is something wrong, it is sent back that day, instead of it sitting in a pile for days or weeks and, when it is reached, it has to go back to the start of the process again.  It is very frustrating.  I know the office is doing its best but we need to improve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Q00900","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I commend you, a Chathaoirligh, on your speech this morning in the Lower House.<\/p> <p>It will come as no surprise that I am again raising the secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer, to the public health professorship in Trinity College Dublin.  This morning, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, said on \"Morning Ireland\" that he did not sign off on it.  Last night, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, said he was not involved.  He said it was unusual.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said he did not sign off on it.  Both he and the Minister for Health did not sign off on it, but the reality is somebody did sign off on it.  The question that needs to be answered is, why are we, the taxpayers, paying the salary of the outgoing CMO in Trinity College Dublin and paying the salary of the new Chief Medical Officer?  Why is Trinity College Dublin not paying the salary for the newly created position?<\/p> <p>This morning, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, added to the confusion and muddied the waters by his intervention in the interview.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have nothing to do with it, according to themselves.  As I said yesterday and in making my remarks again today, this is not personal.  I commend the role Dr. Holohan played.  I accept the points made by the Minister for Health this morning.  He said we are coming off the back of a pandemic and we must learn to deliver better outcomes in the delivery of healthcare in case of a future pandemic.  However, there is something not right when this situation is allowed to happen.  The three pertinent Ministers, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, had nothing to say or do with regard to signing off on the role.  The Cathaoirleach and the acting Leader will agree it is unusual that a person who is being seconded is being paid by the State and then the State is hiring a Chief Medical Officer.  I have another important question.  Is the position for one year, two years or five years, and will the new Chief Medical Officer be in place for one year, two years or five years?  In fairness to the House, we need answers, and that should happen as a matter of priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Q01000","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I, too, pay tribute to your comments this morning, a Chathaoirligh.

A basic income is no substitute for addressing the bigger and more important issue of decent wages in the arts.  However, it is a very important step in terms of ensuring that there is a safety net for artists.  We have questions about how the scheme will work and will direct them at a later date.  <\/p><p>In welcoming the basic income for artists, I do so with mixed feelings because today 21 artists in Richmond Road Studios in Dublin 3 are facing the prospect of eviction from their studios as of tomorrow.  They have been in the studios for 20 years.  They are an amazing set of artists engaged in visual art, photography, painting, installation work and other art forms.  They received a letter two weeks ago to say that the building of which they are tenants is in receivership and they will be kicked out.  In fact, they are now currently trespassing.  I want to make a direct appeal to the receivers, Kroll, to engage with the tenants.  There are works that are valuable to the artists, if not necessarily financially valuable, and equipment in the building and we do not want an ugly situation to arise whereby the locks are changed.  To date, Kroll has failed to engage with the tenants despite our many pleas.  There is a bigger issue here with regard to how the Government is securing art space in Dublin and across the country.  We have seen a continual hollowing out of arts space.  The Government needs to put in place finance and other resources to ensure that arts groups can survive and thrive in this city and country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Q01100","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I would also like to join with Members of the House in commending the Cathaoirleach on the speech he delivered at the historic joint session of the Houses this morning.

In light of that, I ask for a review of the protocols, practices and procedures around such invitations.  We should never afford additional privileges to people in such an unhelpful situation.  It could have sent out the wrong signal.  It took diplomacy too far and could have backfired.  Luckily, it did not and a diplomatic stand-off was averted at the last minute.

Thankfully, all's well that ends well.<\/p> <p>I have reliable information on the names of the companies in Ireland still trading in Russia.  I ask the Acting Leader to assist us in ascertaining the exact names of these large firms, which are publicly listed companies.  That would be the first step.  I would suggest the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs invites in the CEOs of those companies to explain themselves.  There are two sides to every story.  A lot of explaining has to be done in light of what we are witnessing and the carnage and barbaric acts carried out by Russia.

It is important that young children have a proper meal at least once a day, and this programme provides that.  There are a lot of questions to be answered in terms of how the scheme affects school attendance and whether it has helped that since it has been implemented.

What is happening is all being done in the best interests of the citizens of Ukraine and giving them some sort of opportunity to have a life and a roof over their heads while they are here.  As the Taoiseach said, this is their home for as long as they want to be here.  That rang true today in all contributions.<\/p> <p>After the Easter recess, I ask that we have a debate on mental health with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  It seems as though we go from one crisis to the next quite quickly without reflecting on the previous crisis.  Over the past three years, as the Acting Leader knows, mental health has been very challenging and the demand on mental health services has dramatically increased on the back of Covid.  Given the increasing numbers coming to Ireland from Ukraine, people will need services.  There will be an influx of demand over the next period of time.  It is important that we in the Chamber have a debate on how we manage that in terms of mental health.  It has always been an area of the health service that we would all agree is underfunded.  It is very hard to fund it to the extent that is needed, but the challenges in that regard will increase more and more as the months go on.<\/p> <p>This is an issue in my country.  We do not have any acute psychiatric beds in Tipperary.  If someone in south Tipperary needs overnight care, he or she has to go to Kilkenny and those in north Tipperary have to go to Ennis.  We used to have acute psychiatric beds in St. Michael's in Clonmel.  There has been a lot of investment in health services in Tipperary.  A 40-bed modular unit was opened by the Taoiseach a number of months ago.  St. Michael's is being turned into a step-down unit, which is positive, but there has been no investment in long-term beds in Clonmel and Tipperary.  We need the Minister to support Tipperary.  It is not right and proper that people have to go as far as Kilkenny and Ennis to get services.  A lot of good volunteers work in mental health in Tipperary, but the Government needs to support us locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#R00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I would like to raise the issue of animal welfare, and not for the first time, in this Chamber.

We cannot allow people who carry out such barbaric acts on defenceless animals to go unpunished.  That said, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine will tonight have a third session on the completely unnecessary cruelty that is being inflicted on dogs daily, some of which is legal in this country.  <\/p><p>A couple of weeks, the committee heard from Mr. Tim Kirby of PetBond that surgical artificial insemination is on the increase in Ireland and in some cases is being carried out by non-vets.  Surgical artificial insemination is cruel and has rightly been banned in Britain.  While previously confined to the greyhound industry in this country, it is now happening right across the dog world to feed an insatiable desire for artificial breeds like pomskies.  Whether it is being done to a greyhound, a bulldog or a Pomeranian, surgical artificial insemination is a highly invasive procedure that cannot be justified.  To make matters worse, in 2021 there were 27 cases of dead dogs' semen being used in the greyhound industry.<\/p><p>The other practice of canine mutilation that is increasing in Ireland is ear-cropping.  It is fashionable among bulldog and doberman breeds and while it is illegal in Ireland, animal welfare organisations and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have said the law needs to be strengthened as it is virtually impossible to prosecute anyone under the current legislation.  Ear-cropping is a mutilation that denies a dog its basic means of communication and can have lifelong impacts on the dog&rsquo;s welfare.  I ask that we have a long overdue debate in the House on the issue of animal welfare but, in particular, dog welfare.

Everyone commended the work the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle did to ensure the joint sitting of the Houses took place this morning.  It was very moving to be in the D&aacute;il to listen to President Zelenskyy. What an inspirational, incredible person he is.  He has the weight of the world on his shoulders.  I was looking at him and thinking that while he was calm, compassionate and passionate when speaking, he must be surviving on very little, if any, sleep as he tries to give direction and leadership and engage with world leaders.  I know all Members will join me in saying <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>.<\/p><p>On the points raised, Senator Lombard spoke about social media platforms and how they are regulated or, indeed, unregulated, particularly in respect of the amount of time children are spending on their tablets.  He sought a debate on that type of interaction, how we monitor it and the hazards of technology.Four Members of this House, Senators Malcolm Byrne, Cassells, Warfield and Carrigy, are active members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will be in the Seanad for Committee Stage in the week after Easter.  This welcome, important and necessary legislation will regulate social media companies.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about higher education funding, not for the first time, and noted it is the anniversary of the Cassells report.  He made the point that the EU report requested by the Minister at that time has still not been circulated, even though we believe the Government has received it.  As the Senator pointed out, we know the report will state that the sector is in crisis.  <\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne also spoke of the need for reform of the SUSI grant and the need to address the whole issue of core funding for once and for all.  He also congratulated Eoin, the two Caoimhes and P&aacute;draig from Gorey who won first prize in the certified Irish Angus schools competition in Croke Park last week.  I am very happy to add my congratulations on behalf of the House.  I saw some of the images posted by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and Deputy Michael Moynihan, which were wonderful.  It is incredible that the four people mentioned by the Senator do not come from a farming background.  It just shows that it is very important that we encourage children in an urban environment to learn more about the rural environment.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about the HSE being in the public eye.  It is a good thing that the six regional authorities have been set up.  Basically, this measure is the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which was proposed in an all-party committee report.  Its main focus will be on primary care and the co-ordination of services.  That is very much to be welcomed.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, spoke about the role we have to play in the area of energy.  She made the very welcome announcement that homeowners who generate their own energy will be able to sell excess energy this summer.  That is a win-win situation for everybody and a very important policy which we welcome.  The Senator also mentioned that planning permission for solar panels, particularly on public buildings, is part of a Green Party Bill that has been slow in coming.  We support her on that issue.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about the pilot basic income for artists scheme which is a fantastic and revolutionary initiative.  He is right that we have to ensure diversity and equity in respect of those who will be able to access the scheme.  He also spoke about the merits of the night-time economy.  Again, it is good that we had announcements in that respect in the past week.<\/p><p>Senator Hoey spoke about the month of awareness of sexual assault and, in particular, the women of Ukraine who are grappling with rape.  We see absolutely harrowing images.  Sexual violence is taking place on a huge scale.  Sadly, that is always a feature of war.  The Senator is correct to make the point that Poland is a very restrictive country in respect of reproductive rights.  It is very important that an international organisation has the opportunity to go in to provide oversight.  I am very proud that Ireland has given &euro;1.5 million for reproductive and sexual rights for women from the Ukraine to help address this problem, which is one that has been recognised.  What does one say to a woman who has been raped by a Russian soldier, finds that she is pregnant in Poland and does not having access to termination services?  It is just completely wrong.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy spoke about the trauma that is visited on so many Ukrainians in this country when they hear of horrific events in their country, including murder, and suffering bereavement while they are here.  He also spoke about the work being carried out by local organisations in Roscommon.  The Senator also congratulated Denyse Campbell on becoming the new president of the Irish Hotels Federation and we certainly add our voices to those congratulations.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the Limerick emergency hub and called for more supports for communities outside Dublin.  That community approach is greatly needed on a co-ordinated level.  I am meeting a lady this afternoon, Angie Gough, who has set up a community group to roll out supports nationally in respect of that, which is very important.  While we need skills and supports, the hand of friendship, no matter how we extend it, is of great importance and I have no doubt that will happen right around the country.  Senator Byrne also spoke about the welcome acquisition by Limerick City and County Council of St. John&rsquo;s Castle.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the need to provide weapons to Ukraine.  He should note that while we are not politically neutral, we are still militarily neutral.  That is very precious to many of us in this country.  It is still very important.  There is no doubt that there will be a citizens&rsquo; assembly on neutrality and that is the right way to go.

It is wonderful that she has chosen to visit Ireland and she is certainly very welcome.  The Senator spoke about building at Dublin Airport and the challenges with Garda vetting and work permits.  He asked for the Army to be brought in to solve its problems.  It is simply not good enough in my view.  I believe 1.7 million passports will be processed this year which is an enormous number.  We need to get it right and many more measures need to be put in place.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer spoke about the secondment of the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, to Trinity College.  We need collaboration between healthcare and academia; that is how we learn.  Dr. Holohan has incredible experience in the public health area.  It is very significant and welcome that he has the opportunity to share that with the students at Trinity College and hopefully beyond.  Open-ended secondments are a regular feature and are common across the Civil Service and public service to encourage interdepartmental and interagency co-operation.  Many political staff are seconded from the Civil Service and public service.  Tony Holohan has given the country wonderful service at a very difficult time for him personally.  While the Senator said that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have not answered any questions, what about the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris?  Questions also need to be put to him.<\/p><p>Senator Sherlock spoke about the basic income for artists and spoke about 23 artists losing their building because it is going into receivership.  That is sad to hear.  I hope there is some engagement there.  I agree with her that we need to support artists to survive and thrive.<\/p><p>Senator Martin asked me to find a list of companies still trading in Russia.  I believe that is beyond my payscale.  He is right in saying that the Joint Committee on European Union affairs should look for that list and invite representatives in.  There are questions to be asked and that certainly should be done.<\/p><p>Senator Burke asked that we invite the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to come to the House to debate the comprehensive evaluation of the school meals programme.  I support us doing that.  <\/p><p>Senator Ahearn called for a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on mental health.  We cannot just say mental health; we need to be more specific because it is such a complex area.  We can certainly look for a debate on how supports will be put in place for those from Ukraine.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has secured a far higher budget than ever before.  Every cent of that is needed.  It is also about outcomes and not just about money.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan spoke about animal welfare.  She spoke about two particular cases of mutilated animals in south County Dublin.  She also informed us about the surgical artificial insemination which is being used for artificial breeds of dog.  It would need to be very carefully monitored if not made illegal.  Ear cropping is illegal but the law needs to be strengthened as it is very difficult to enforce.  She said it is the subject of debate in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine.  I certainly hope that measures would come from that discussion.  I support having a debate on animal welfare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#S00300","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Leader and all the other Members for their remarks on the joint sitting.

This is actually a positive day.  I know the Minister of State will interpret my remarks as I intend them to be interpreted.  They concern community service and disability, in the context of which we are here today.  Everything we have been doing is under the framework contained in Disability Action Plan Framework: Review of Disability Social Care Demand and Capacity Requirements to 2032.  There are a couple of points I want to make.  I fully support the Minister of State and will work with her every step of the way on this.<\/p> <p>There are several anomalies concerning assessment and intervention.  In many cases, the delivery of a service or intervention never takes place.  It is particularly concerning when one comes from a mild intellectual disability background or platform.  Those in this category are excluded, which is a worry.  The action plan framework, which we should all be asked to examine and work from, refers to day-service places for school-leavers, personal assistance and home supports, respite services, including alternative respite services, and residential care in the community.  Let me start with the last of those, in respect of which I wish to make an appeal to the Minister and those charged with delivery at local level.  I am told those over 65 with an intellectual disability and without a bed in a residential service are being offered nursing home places only.  If that is correct, an ageist and ableist policy is being developed.  Those who have been in a care centre or the community are having traditional supports removed and are being put into nursing homes that do not have the ability to deliver the supports they require.<\/p> <p>Consider the point I made at the beginning, which was on the link between assessment and intervention.  The link is quite broken.  Assessment and intervention are separated and there is a time delay and an anomaly.  There is no continuity of experience for those who need it the most.  That needs to be addressed at local level on the ground.<\/p> <p>The priorities in the document we have, action on which will be enabled by the Bill, concern the key role of respite in supporting family carers in enhancing service.  While these are wonderful, aspirational words, I have some questions.  Is there a lowballing of the numbers being provided for?  Are they too low?  Are we missing out?  Have we a full and accurate picture?  Are we underestimating the number of people who require school places and respite?  I do not understand the delivery mechanism.<\/p> <p>Regarding respite care or respite services, it is stated an increase in capacity to provide an initial 12 respite houses and a further increase of nine-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#V00400","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I remind the Senator that we have three minutes left.

I am aware that the Minister of State is a very hard worker and really cares about people with disabilities.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and absolutely love it and the idea of bringing about equality for people with a disability.  This legislation should not become another Act that is not implemented.

There is no denying that in the context of respite.  The whole focus has to be on having real and clear understanding and guidance to meet the needs and serve the rights of the individual.  It is about informing the person and his or her family of their rights and how to access services, and being open and transparent in that regard.  There is no point in the Government providing policy and Departments providing money and it going then to the HSE without following the money to see how the service is delivered to the end user, whether in a day service, respite or residential care.  It is also about meeting the needs of the individuals.  I am acutely aware of the importance of page 7 of the Bill.  To me, it is the gospel page in terms of ensuring delivery and holding people to account in that regard.<\/p><p>I look forward to being within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth because I look at the matter with a rights-based lens.

As Members will be aware, all remaining mandatory public health measures were removed on 28 February.  As recommended by our medical advisers, we have transitioned from regulation and population-wide restrictions to a focus on public health advice, personal judgment and personal protective behaviours.<\/p> <p>The overall situation is improving.  The number of people receiving general hospital care has fallen.  However, we continue to have high levels of infection and a significant number of cases in hospitals.  The total number of Covid-19 cases in hospital increased from approximately 600 to approximately 1,600 through March.  The burden this has placed on patients and healthcare workers has been relentless.  I wish to acknowledge the ongoing efforts across the healthcare system during these times.  Thankfully, in line with a reduction in case numbers, there has been a reduction in the number of Covid patients in hospital.  The number has fallen from 1,600 to 1,333 this afternoon.<\/p> <p>Of those in hospital with Covid, approximately half are there because of Covid, with the other half categorised as asymptomatic infectious.  When it comes to the patients in intensive care with Covid, approximately one third of them are there because of Covid.  That number has fallen significantly in the past month.  Importantly, of those with Covid in hospital, only two in five have had a booster vaccine, while approximately half of those in ICU with Covid have had a booster vaccine.  To give a sense of how this works out, there were recently 1,600 Covid patients in hospital but the number of them who were in hospital on that day because of Covid and who had been boosted was a much lower figure of 370.  Similarly on a particular day there were approximately 50 patients in ICU with Covid, but only 18 of them were there because of Covid and only nine of those had been boosted.  That underlines how essential it still is that people get their booster vaccine.  It is one of the three main public health messages right now: first, get your vaccine or booster; second, if you have symptoms, stay at home for 48 hours until those symptoms have largely resolved or, if you have a positive test, stay home for seven days; and, third, wear a mask in the appropriate settings, including public transport, crowded spaces, healthcare settings, nursing homes or while visiting a person who is at higher risk for Covid.<\/p> <p>The current BA.2 sublineage is now the dominant variant in Ireland, accounting for approximately 95% of all cases.  There has been an overall reduction in PCR testing volumes and test positivity, which is an encouraging sign, while the total daily number of positive antigen tests has also decreased.<\/p> <p>As regards vaccination, more than 10.7 million doses have now been administered, including nearly 3 million booster doses.  We have a very high vaccine and booster rate which has obviously been essential in our national response.  However, there are still approximately 700,000 men and women aged 16 or older who have had their first two doses, so are very much in favour and supportive of boosters, but have not yet had their booster vaccine.  A large part of that is because so many people got Covid a few months back and there has to be a three-month wait between having had Covid and getting the booster.  It is really important that those 700,000 people get the booster as soon as they can.  The booster uptake rate remains too low in younger groups.  For example, a little over half of those aged 18 to 39 have had the booster.  There is a host of initiatives going on to target these groups, including a high level of public communication and advertising.<\/p> <p>As regards the paediatric vaccination programme, as of 27 March, approximately 120,000 first doses had been administered, with 101,000 fully vaccinated.  More than 133,000 children aged five to 11 have now registered for a vaccination.<\/p> <p>We are also working hard to address and support the health and other needs of Ukrainian refugees entering Ireland, including making sure they have full and rapid access to vaccinations.<\/p> <p>As regards new and emerging treatments for Covid-19, a new therapeutics advisory group was established to evaluate, advise and recommend on all the therapeutics that could be used here.  Therapeutics have been administered, though it is important to note that the treatments are not for widespread use.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The benefit is limited to particular cohorts of higher risk, more vulnerable patients.

As we move forward, the Government will continue to ensure that our response is agile and flexible, and that we can move quickly in response to any new emerging threat which obviously we are monitoring here and around the world very closely. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#W00500","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking time out of his schedule to update us.  Thankfully, Covid-19 has in one sense blended into the background of all the other political issues and is not the main political issue.  However, we all know that it is still a concern in our hospitals and communities.  While the case numbers are high, we are not seeing as many people get as sick.  That is a result of the success of the roll-out of the vaccination programme, which was overwhelmingly successful in this country.  People bought into it.  They trusted what the Minister, the officials in his Department and the people in the HSE were doing.  That is very good.<\/p> <p>I am quite concerned at the low booster uptake.   Many people who are in hospital are not vaccinated or, if they are primarily vaccinated, are not boosted.  As the Minister pointed out, some of that is to do with the very high rate of Covid-19 infection over the past couple of months.  People are waiting for that to wash through.  It would be no harm to have another public awareness campaign in regard to the necessity of the booster because in many people&rsquo;s minds, this is over and life is back to relative normality.  As we know people are still getting infected and are getting quite sick.  We all know people who got quite sick over the past couple of months even though they were vaccinated.  The public awareness campaign needs to be ramped up a little for the next couple of weeks.<\/p> <p>I wish to make reference to the very low mortality rates we have had in Ireland.  If we compare that internationally, we will see that it is a really good statistic.  We did not throw older people or more vulnerable members of our communities to the wolves.  We actually looked after them.  When we are assessing this in years to come, the main metric to come out of this will be that we protected the vulnerable people in our communities.  That is something we all played our part in.  We should all be very proud of that.<\/p> <p>I am fascinated with the way other countries, especially in the Far East, are dealing with the pandemic at the moment.  I am thinking of China and Hong Kong in particular.  They pursued a zero-Covid strategy but are having serious issues at the moment as they seek to handle the pandemic.  They are locking down communities again.  It is worth noting that when we were debating various Covid legislation, regulations and statements over the past two years, the Minister always pointed out that we could not put a zero-Covid strategy in place, regardless of how attractive that was.  We were confident in our plan and our own medical advice.  Based on that, we have seen the country through this very difficult period.  We are not back to square one as other parts of the world are.  Absolutely everybody involved in that effort - the Minister and his officials, Paul Reid and his colleagues in the HSE, the vaccinators, the primary care centre staff and all the front-line workers - is to be commended.  It is good that we are in a good place.  While the threat is still there, we are in a good place.  As the pandemic goes on and we emerge from it, I look forward to discussing the various measures we are going to have to put in place coming into autumn and winter.  We are in a dramatically different place from this time last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#X00200","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, who is a regular visitor, although probably not as regular as he used to be.  The pandemic is now something we are living with as opposed to trying to deal with on an emergency basis.<\/p> <p>I would like to mention a funny thing that I have noticed from my empirical engagement with people.  There is no scientific basis for this.  People who are getting Covid-19 now are getting quite sick.  I note the Minister's predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Harris, was quite sick with it.  Quite a number of people I have engaged with have been quite sick with it.  Many Members of the Oireachtas who got it, like the Minister, Deputy Harris, were quite sick with it.  It has most definitely not gone away.  Certainly, the public awareness in terms of following public health guidelines has dramatically reduced.  Empirical evidence is that hand sanitiser dispensers at supermarkets and other public areas are more often empty than they are full.  I agree with the principle of continuing public health and public awareness campaigns.  They will have to continue.<\/p> <p>The announcement by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, this morning of a fourth booster dose for vulnerable adults is long overdue.  To be frank, it should have happened sooner than this.  I cannot understand why NIAC is so slow in making its recommendations.  We all knew that people had to get a booster vaccine six, eight or ten months ago.  Yet, it took NIAC longer than it should have to come with a recommendation on that.  We are going to have a conversation about how this kind of advice is coming.  NIAC is independent, but vaccinations are happening in other countries.  We are not unique.  It is going to come to us as well.<\/p> <p>I do not know how we are going to manage or deal with this as we go forward.  Perhaps we can reconstitute NIAC or join NIAC with a newly defined NPHET.  We need to have a debate and conversation on public health and pandemic planning going forward.  That can only really be done against the backdrop of a public inquiry into this country&rsquo;s handling of the pandemic.  I believe such an inquiry will endorse the work done by this Government and its predecessor.  Per head of population, the number of fatalities - the number of people who tragically lost their lives to Covid-19 - in this country is among the lowest in the European Union.  We actually fare pretty well in terms of an international comparison worldwide.  It is down to the people.  Our handling of this has been about saving lives.<\/p> <p>Two years ago, when Covid-19 was raging, people followed the social distancing guidelines and stayed at home.  I think it was this week two years ago that the 2 km requirement was introduced.  That was done to save lives.  People bought into it to save lives, and it worked.  That said, we must remember the 5,000 or 6,000 people in this country who lost their lives to Covid-19.  That cannot be forgotten.  The memorial that took place a couple of weeks ago, on the Sunday after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, was very poignant, appropriate and dignified.<\/p> <p>I was at the Joint Committee on Health this morning.  I think it was the first time we had Paul Reid and Robert Watt in that we were not actually talking about Covid-19.  We were talking about other issues, but Covid-19 needs to be continuously on the agenda.  It cannot be off the agenda.  Thankfully this fourth wave has now subsided but we need periodically to recalibrate the public mindset to remind people we are living with what is the residue of a pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#X00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

It is important to note that the virus is still very dangerous for immunocompromised people.  Speaking as one of those people, I have no doubt that the vaccines and boosters I received saved me from serious illness a few weeks ago.

The importance of vaccination and getting boosters should also continue to be highlighted, particularly in light of the point the Minister has made about the relatively poor take-up of boosters.<\/p><p>Given that NPHET has been stood down, there is now an issue with transparency as to what advice is given to the Minister or the Government.  Any public health advice given should be fully published whenever the Minister is given an update.<\/p><p>The underlying problems in the health system have been put on full display again since \"normal\" services, if we can call them normal, have been resumed.  It will not surprise the Minister to hear that I will have to mention the situation at University Hospital Limerick, where there are serious issues of overcrowding and cancelled appointments, and recent reports of rows of ambulances parked outside the hospital, unable to offload patients.  Then there are the trolley numbers.  The number of patients on trolleys in Limerick was at an all-time high of 1,059 in March of last year.  In March of this year, the figure was at its highest ever at 1,671, more than 500 more than last year's record.  It is nothing short of scandalous.  No doubt the situation is exacerbated by Covid-19, but the problems in accident and emergency departments have been there for years.  Now, unfortunately, they are becoming a disaster at University Hospital Limerick.  We need to see a plan that allows hospitals to maintain services while still being able to cope with Covid cases.  The Government needs to do everything possible to ease the burden on front-line healthcare workers.<\/p><p>I wish to mention those healthcare workers and carers who have worked tirelessly and heroically over the past two years.  The Government has given very little recognition to carers, which is regrettable.  Carers got no respite and little or no help as services closed down.  They were forgotten about and continue to be left behind as they will not be included in the bonus payment for healthcare workers, of which we really need to see the details.  The Covid-19 recognition payment for front-line public sector healthcare workers was announced months ago but the detail does not seem to have been worked out yet, which is a little baffling.<\/p><p>In the few seconds left to me I will raise one final issue.  As the Minister will know, tomorrow we will deal with the safe access zones Bill and there has been a cross-party coalition of the willing to support the Together for Safety Bill.  He will also know that, unfortunately, there has been no Government Bill on the matter to date.  I gave the Minister a commitment that we would work with such a Government Bill if it were to arrive.  Not only is there no such Bill, however, but the Minister will know that the Department confirmed just two weeks ago to the health committee that there is no timeline as to when the Bill will arrive.  The only Bill to deal with safe access zones is the Bill we will debate tomorrow.  I ask for an indication that the Minister will continue to facilitate the passage of that Bill.  I am sure he and I agree that women and pregnant people should not have to wait one second longer.  We have protests daily in Limerick and Dublin at present, during Lent.  It is intolerable.  Activists from the campaign have been called at work and targeted in the most vicious of ways.  I hope for a positive indication from the Minister on that point ahead of tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#X00400","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.  It has been over two years since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Globally, it has taken more than 6 million lives.  On the island of Ireland more than 10,000 people have died.  Thankfully, however, because of the Minister's and the Department's work and the miraculously swift vaccine roll-out, many lives have been saved and we have been able to return to some kind of normality.  I must mention, however, that these miracle vaccines remain inaccessible in much of the world, a fact that reflects rather poorly on us in the developed world.  To vaccinated people, Covid-19 poses much less of a threat than it once did.  That is an immense relief, and policymaking has rightly changed to reflect that development.  However, we cannot forget the large number of people who remain vulnerable and those who suffer persistent illness after contracting Covid-19.  This House voted to support a full TRIPS waiver in December.  Unfortunately, when it appeared there was hope for a waiver, it quickly became apparent that a full TRIPS waiver was still being blocked.  The global south is still not being given equitable access to vaccination.  If we are serious about ending the public health emergency, we need a full TRIPS waiver and no more evasions or delays to equitable global access to vaccination.<\/p> <p>The removal of mask mandates on public transport was, I believe, premature and put at risk those who provide and rely on public transport, as my colleagues, Senators Higgins and Flynn, raised in the House last February.  We need to consider the reintroduction of mask mandates in enclosed indoor public settings.  It has overwhelming public support.  A recent Am&aacute;rach Research poll found that 65% of respondents favoured mask mandates in public indoor spaces.  Mandating masks in certain public spaces such as public transportation and supermarkets means that those individuals trying to reduce their risk of exposure are supported.  We should acknowledge that sections of the trade union movement representing some of the most at-risk workers, such as the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, have called for the reintroduction of a mask mandate in certain settings.  The pandemic has been a lesson in just how much we rely on the labour of healthcare and public transportation workers.  When they ask us to reintroduce measures that protect their health and safety while at work, we should demonstrate real gratitude by taking action on their behalf.  A poll by AA Ireland found that 41% of people indicated that they were less likely to use public transportation after the end of the requirement for mask wearing.  Just 4% said they were more likely to use public transport services.  The lapse of this measure has therefore made our public services less accessible to the public.  I have heard from people who are older or otherwise medically vulnerable whose mobility has been limited by their feeling unsafe on public transportation.  That is a really worrying situation.  Public spaces should feel safe and accessible to everyone.<\/p> <p>I wish to touch on a publication produced by the Joint Committee on Health about vitamin D deficiency in Ireland and its relation to Covid-19 outcomes.  The report looked at studies done around the world that found that increased levels of vitamin D produced better public health outcomes when dealing with the pandemic.  Finland, for example, a country that mandated that certain food products be enriched with high levels of vitamin D, has the lowest number of Covid cases and deaths in the EU.  The report recommended that vitamin D supplements be given to healthcare workers, care home residents and medically vulnerable individuals.  It also suggested that the supplements be available at Covid testing locations.  These recommendations should be revisited.<\/p> <p>Finally, I wish to highlight comments made by John Wenger, chair of the Expert Group on the Role of Ventilation in Reducing Transmission of Covid-19.  He expressed disappointment with the lack of Government action to support the delivery of ventilation upgrades, despite the delivery of two reports in 2021 that showed that ventilation is an essential element of an effective public health response.  Ventilation is essential to creating a long-term strategy of dealing with Covid.  We all want to limit the spread of this disease while imposing on people's lives as minimally as possible.  It is a significant challenge, but that does not excuse the stalled progress in this area.  These are ways in which we can reduce the impact of Covid on many people's lives.  We cannot ignore this Covid wave, so let us take common-sense action and keep people safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Y00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I have asked Senator McGahon to take the Chair in a few minutes to allow me to make a short contribution.

I am very grateful and thrilled that we are here today and those regulations are no more.  There is, however, still a need for caution and care when it comes to the protocols of mask wearing and washing our hands and, most of all, the booster.  One would be forgiven for thinking Covid had gone away.  I noted last night that we got through a whole news bulletin without Covid being mentioned, which was extraordinary.  This time two years ago I had fears about my family members making it to the summer alive, so to make it through a whole news bulletin in that way was really good.  There is a danger in that, and everything is relative.  Naturally, we are horrified by what we see in Ukraine, so it is easy to forget about Covid, unless you work in healthcare.  The people who work in healthcare are to be congratulated, lauded and empathised with for just how difficult it is.  We need a new booster campaign to tell the people who were unable to avail of the booster in the first round at Christmas and in December that they are now eligible.  We should get out that information.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Although we have lifted all restrictions, it is necessary for us to ask what other protocols should be recommended.

I thank all involved in the Covid-19 response.  There are key points that I wish to make on Covid-19 today.  We were premature in getting rid of the mask mandate.  Our vaccination programme worked without it being mandatory so we must have a real incentive for the vaccine booster programme.  It is important that the replacement for the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, can be put in place as a matter of urgency to give the Minister and the Government the best advice so we can continue to be careful around Covid-19.  The WHO speaks about mitigation and mask-wearing is a help in such mitigation.  It is important that we reissue a call to people to wear masks.<\/p> <p>I have a worry about the leaving certificate and we should come back to it.<\/p> <p>My final point is about the Chief Medical Officer, CMO.  I wish him well in his new position at Trinity College but it is wrong that the State would second him and pay him in tandem with the appointment of a new CMO who the State would also have to pay.  I heard the Minister this morning on \"Morning Ireland\" and I watched the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, speak last night.  I heard the Taoiseach speaking about this in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  Somebody signed off on this and it is not good enough.  I take issue with it and I do not normally do so.  It is wrong in any language.  The Minister of State was correct in saying on this morning's \"Morning Ireland\" that we can learn from the pandemic and we should be prepared for future pandemics.  I agree with the Minister in that respect and would walk to the end of the Earth to support him on it.  What is happening with the secondment, however, is wrong and it should not be allowed.  I thank the Minister for his work nonetheless, along with all the front-line staff and everybody who is involved with the fight against Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Z00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I usually do not disagree with Senator Buttimer but I do not agree with that point.  My understanding of such secondments is that Ministers do not sign off on them.  I thought the Minister did quite well in this morning's two interviews in the media that I heard.  We will differ on the matter and I am sure the Minister will clarify it further.  Dr. Holohan has made a major contribution over a period, which we all acknowledge.  He took much abuse as well.<\/p> <p>It is really great to see the Minister here again.  Like others, I commend him on always coming here to deal with the matter head-on.  It is great to see the senior Minister coming before us.  I know I often say \"well done\" on the work that has been done and the Minister is always anxious to say that people on the front line, including doctors, nurses, porters and everybody else, have helped out in society to deal with Covid-19.  I acknowledge that today.<\/p> <p>It strikes me that a number of young people have not taken the booster.  When this is said to them, they say they will not take it.  I agree with others who have said we must think about how to target such people and incentivise them to take the booster.  Even in some of my family circle, people have said they will not take the booster even when we say that Covid-19 is still around and ask would it not be a wise course of action.  We need to target such people again.<\/p> <p>I wear a mask in any crowded area and I will continue to do that.  Some people have come up to me and told me I could stop wearing a mask.  It is a question of speaking with people.  Every time I hear the Minister speak he mentions masks and the booster vaccine.  Having watched this over the past couple of days, it seems 50% or 60% of people are wearing masks.  Some people will never do it, even if it had a legal basis.  We must pump out the message continuously and this will lead to more people wearing a mask.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway mentioned how people have got very sick and they have become sick with Covid-19 recently.  How many of those people would have survived if they had not received a vaccination?  Many more people would be deceased at this point if it had not been administered.  It is regrettable that between 5,000 and 6,000 people have lost their lives but it is true to say that in a European or world context, we have done very well in fighting this pandemic.<\/p> <p>Caution is important and we must keep putting out that message.  I agree with the Minister that we must allow society get back to functioning again.  The economy, families and communities have suffered terribly.  People's well-being also suffered because sport was affected and the usual way we live our lives was completely disrupted.  It was a shock to us all and a shock to the world.  We must use the phrase \"live with Covid\" time and again.  I only speak as a layperson but I believe we will have to deal with Covid-19 for a long time to come.  It is important we are able to manage it and be aware of what is happening.  We must be able to watch out for any difficulties that arise.<\/p> <p>All in all, the Government has done a good job and the Minister has given good leadership.  Again, I say \"well done\" to all the people on the front lines, including the carers who have done much good work.  There are also people in the community, such as postal workers and others who did much work to help people during the period of Covid-19.  I say \"well done\" to the Minister but we must be cautious and careful as we move along.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#Z00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I have followed regulations at each point but I am against the concept of reintroducing the mandatory wearing of masks in certain settings.  It is not about being anti-mask but rather about acknowledging or realising what stage of the pandemic we are in now compared with before.  I am more than happy to wear a mask on a train or bus or if I feel I am in a crowded place.  I am happy to do that because I am an adult and I can take personal responsibility for that.  At this stage we should not be turning around to say we should reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing in certain settings etc.  We are past that stage of the pandemic, to be frank.  We can see what is happening in Italy and Germany, where it is mandatory to wear the highest grade of mask, yet case numbers are still going the same way they are here.  There is no definitive proof that masks are a great help, although it is fair to say they are a mitigation measure.  When case numbers go up, it may be the case that we should be seen to do something so the idea is that we should start wearing masks again as a result.  I have seen it here in the Houses of the Oireachtas over the past two weeks.  It is a level of performance and a case of being seen to do something rather than listening to the science.  We have listened to and trusted science for the past two and a half years.  We do not have the CMO, NPHET or anybody else at a scientific level saying we should reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing.  That is my view.  It is not about being anti-mask but we should have that debate.  We are now at a different stage of the debate and I trust in the personal responsibility of people.  I will wear a mask in places I do not feel comfortable or where there are too many people.  That is no problem but let us leave it to the personal responsibility of people.  That is my view because we are at a different stage of the pandemic than before.<\/p> <p>It took Vladimir Putin and war on the European Continent to end Covid-19 because for the past three months nobody has been talking about it in the media.  I have said for the past two years that the media hyped up anxiety and tensions and we can see people are much more relaxed and at ease now.

Simple operations and everyday procedures have been cancelled.  It is really not acceptable.  It is going to have to be looked at again.  Many people wear masks in certain circumstances, but I think a clear message needs to be sent out that Covid has not gone away.  Perhaps we are failing to get that message out.  Some people are being very blas&eacute; and think that because they have had Covid, they will not get it again.  We all know that is misinformation and people can get Covid again.  While I do not believe it should be compulsory, I believe people should be advised to wear a mask in certain circumstances, for example, if they are going indoors or into a crowd.  I am aware the Government is doing something in that regard.  We are all adults, and need to take personal responsibility.

I would like to start by echoing the sentiments of Senator Murphy.  This has been a brutal time.  Thousands of people living in Ireland have died and many thousands more have been very sick.  It has been the most difficult of times.  Relative to most other countries in the world, Ireland has done well in protecting people and keeping them safe.  The credit for that goes to the national effort.  It is not about Government or all of us in the Oireachtas.  Obviously, all of us here have a role to play, but what has characterised Ireland's response to Covid is solidarity and a national effort, where people have stepped up, taken care of each other, looked after each other and kept each other safe throughout the country.  When we look back on it in years to come, it is something Ireland will rightly be proud of, while obviously being cognisant of the horrific toll it has taken on life, health and so many aspects of our country.<\/p> <p>The advice at the moment is to get vaccinated or boosted, to wear a mask in the appropriate settings, and to stay at home if you are symptomatic.  It is very important we continue to get that message out.  I acknowledge the comments from several colleagues who have asked that we push further on communications.  We can, and we are doing so.  We have been communicating the whole time, but as one Senator pointed out, the war in Ukraine has dominated news coverage for very understandable reasons.  It has been quite difficult to get the same level of messaging out there, but we will continue and redouble our efforts to do that.  We have to reach the 700,000 people who are clearly supportive of vaccines and are protected by them, who have had their two doses and have protected their country, friends and families in doing so, and tell them it is equally important they get their third dose.  At the same time, I received advice from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, late last night on a second booster for those aged 65 and over and the immunocompromised.  There is more subtlety and nuance to it, but that is the main message.  In its letter to me, NIAC emphasised how important it is for people to get the booster and for pregnant women to get the vaccine.<\/p> <p>There has been a lot of very useful talk and contributions made on the future and what we are doing to prepare for the future.  There are multiple things going on at the moment.  The first is the day-to-day surveillance of the epidemiological situation.  That is being led by the Department and the Chief Medical Officer and his team.  They are pulling in experts as required.  I assure Senators there is an ongoing daily surveillance of what is happening in Ireland and around the world, and what is happening in our hospitals, nursing homes, communities and so forth.  I am getting ongoing advice.  As I said earlier, we need to publish that advice.  Some of it has been put up online in recent days.  The advice is coming in regularly.  Absolutely, Members of the Oireachtas and members of the public and the media have a right to see it.  We will ensure it is made available.<\/p> <p>The second thing that is happening, as colleagues will be aware, is that Professor Brady is leading a piece of work at the moment that is looking back at Ireland's performance in Covid, including lessons learned, what we did well and what we did not do so well, and decisions we got right and decisions we did not get right, with a view to informing the future of public health and what we can learn from that.  It is a very important piece of work.  I am expecting a report from that group in the summer.<\/p> <p>The third thing that is happening is that I am establishing a new Covid advisory group.  There is a team looking at the day-to-day epidemiology and another team looking backwards to review what went well and did not go well and what we can learn.  The advisory group will look at the medium to long term in respect of Covid.  It will focus on issues such as technologies we should be deploying, the advances made in testing and tracing, ventilation, diagnosis and treatment, and advances made in the deployment of resources nationally to help fight Covid.  Obviously, we do not want to see another variant of concern but we have to plan on the basis that one could emerge.  I am putting together an expert multidisciplinary group to look at that.  I have spoken to many members over the past week or so who have agreed to take part in it.  We will be announcing more details on the group shortly.<\/p> <p>Finally, research is ongoing.  I have the greatest of respect for Senator Buttimer but I am afraid I will have to disagree with him on this issue.  It is essential that we have world-class research teams looking at future pandemic preparedness.  It is something many Asian countries did when it came to SARS.  They learnt from the SARS outbreak and invested a lot of money in looking to the future.  They determined that if another pandemic were to arrive, they would be prepared.  Dr. Holohan is going to be leading a lot of that thinking and research in Trinity College Dublin.  There will be a broad collaboration across academic institutions and the healthcare system.  There will be links with the WHO, Europe and the HERA Institute, which is looking at the pandemic.  It is essential we undertake world-class research and have teams of researchers who are going to ensure Ireland is as prepared as we possibly can be in the years to come for a future pandemic.  There is a lot of work going on in terms of the current situation, what has happened, the medium term and the long term.<\/p> <p>This debate was originally supposed to be on mask wearing, so I will finish on that issue, because various people have raised it.  The advice is very clear that masks still have an important role to play.  People on public transport should be wearing masks.  It is particularly important to wear a mask in crowded indoor settings.  It is essential that visitors to nursing homes or healthcare settings also wear masks.  That advice is the same.  The question is whether we want to have it on a regulatory basis and whether we want to be fining people and potentially arresting them for non-compliance.  My view and that of the Government and, indeed, the advice of public health is that we do not.  We are transitioning from an emergency phase of Covid to a living with Covid phase.  It is fair to say we do not have the level of compliance, for example, on public transport, that we would like.  We need to do more and we will continue to communicate that.  Obviously, we all have a role in that.  Notwithstanding some variant of concern that may arise, going forward, we want to operate on the basis of responsibility, personal choice and solidarity, which I think has worked very well in Ireland right through the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#AA00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his contribution and wish him well.

The Government yesterday approved my Department's request to seek the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas to opt in to this European Commission proposal.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, also yesterday presented the motion to the D&aacute;il, which was approved.  The proposal seeks to establish a collaboration platform to facilitate exchanges and co-operation within the joint investigation team framework.  Joint investigation teams have proven to be one of the most successful tools for cross-border investigations and prosecutions, so I am delighted to have the opportunity to present this motion to this House today.<\/p><p>By way of background, joint investigation teams, JITs, are set up by two or more states for the purpose of specific criminal investigations with a cross-border impact and for a limited period of time.  This framework allows the competent judicial and law enforcement authorities involved to organise and co-ordinate their actions jointly and to investigate efficiently, even in very complex cases such as organised crime activities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently participates in JITs and supports this initiative.<\/p><p>Although JITs have proven to be one of the most successful tools for cross-border investigations and prosecutions in the EU, practice shows that they have been facing several technical difficulties preventing them from gaining the highest possible efficiency.  The JITs collaboration platform proposed in this regulation aims to solve these problems and deliver the technical support that has been missing thus far.<\/p><p>The proposal will establish a highly secure collaboration platform, provide technological support for participants and ensure that information and evidence can be shared more effectively and safely.  The main objective of the proposal is to provide technological support to those involved in JITs to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their cross-border investigations and prosecutions.  To meet these objectives and to tackle the underlying difficulties, a dedicated IT platform is proposed.  The platform will be accessible to all actors involved in JIT proceedings, including specific member states' representatives, representatives of third countries invited to co-operate in the context of a given investigation team, and the competent European Union bodies, offices and agencies such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The proposed collaboration platform will solve the technical problems and provide the technical support that has been missing from joint investigations to date.<\/p><p>The regulation itself is more technical than legal in nature and applies to the processing of information, including personal data, within the context of a JIT.  That includes the exchange and storage of operational information and evidence as well as non-operational information.  This regulation applies to the operational and post-operational phases of a JIT, starting from the moment the relevant joint investigation agreement is signed by its members. This regulation does not amend or otherwise affect the existing legal provisions on the establishment, conduct or evaluation of JITs.<\/p><p>The legal basis for setting up a JIT is Article 13 of the European Union Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and a Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on JITs.<\/p><p>The Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004 provides for the measures necessary to give effect to European Council decision on JITs and provides for the terms under which the teams can be established.  The Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 2019 made further provisions in this regard to better facilitate the participation of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in JITs.<\/p><p>To provide broader context, this proposal is one of a package of measures announced by the Commission on the digitalisation of justice in the EU as part of a larger initiative to enable the secure electronic communication and exchange of information and documents between courts, national authorities, and justice and home affairs agencies.  This is a stand-alone proposal to the other measures in the digitalisation pack.  Ireland intends to opt in at a later date to other such proposals when the preparatory work is undertaken.<\/p><p>For member states, no technical costs are considered because the platform will be developed and hosted by the EU centrally and accessed remotely using a browser-based system.  There will be a one-off EU development cost incurred centrally of around &euro;10 million.  There will also be an EU centrally recurring cost for technical matters, maintenance and operation of the platform of approximately &euro;3 million per year.  For member states, the platform will not require any adaptions of the national technical infrastructure and access will be web-based, resulting in minimal costs.  It will simply require a PC with a browser and an authorised account which will include relevant security features.<\/p><p>The JIT framework has been pivotal in recent years to tackling serious, organised and transnational crime.  Ireland currently participates in JITs and we certainly see the value in continuing to do so and in supporting this proposal.<\/p><p>By way of an example, following the discovery of 39 individuals in Essex in the United Kingdom in October 2019, the UK, Irish, Belgian and French authorities carried out initial actions and subsequently conducted investigations and searches in regard to these tragic events, which led to the formation of a JIT.  The effective liaison by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the other participating forces in this JIT, with colleagues in the PSNI and various other police agencies, meant a number of suspects were apprehended and sentenced to significant periods of detention following conviction by various courts in several jurisdictions.<\/p><p>This is a practical example of a JIT in action.  The experience gained in respect of multijurisdictional operations and the available support from various European statutory agencies such as Eurojust and Europol cannot be underestimated from an operational and learning perspective and will be built on and utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>Indeed only on Monday, the EU announced that it is setting up a JIT with Ukraine to collect evidence and investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.  In a statement following a phone call with President Zelenskyy regarding the atrocities in Bucha, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe EU is ready to reinforce this effort by sending investigation teams on the ground to support the Ukrainian Prosecution Services.  Eurojust and Europol are ready to assist. <\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->President von der Leyen went on to state:<\/p><blockquote>\tA global response is necessary.

The current proposal will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of such investigations.  Therefore, the Government has no hesitation in commending to the House the motion that we opt in to this proposal.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that opting in to the proposed decision does not create any constitutional or legal issues for the State.  Doing so now under the Article 3 opt-in will ensure we are at the table with our European partners and involved fully in the detailed discussions on the negotiation of the regulation.  It will also indicate our continuing commitment to tackling serious cross-border and transnational crime.<br\/><br\/>I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#JJ00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The motion is an extremely important one.  Joint investigation teams are extremely important and have been recommended and proposed for some time.  I have spent several years on the Joint Committee on Justice.  As part of that brief, I represented the justice committee on the Europol scrutiny committee.  The latter committee is the first time there was political oversight of Europol.  It comprises two representatives from each of the 27 member states, along with representatives of the European Parliament.  It was extremely important because although the judicial system has oversight in this country, Europol did not have any political oversight.  In my time on that committee I learned a significant amount about the importance of co-operation and working together to set up joint understandings.  That is what is needed because, as the Minister and everyone else present are aware, criminals do not recognise borders and nor does crime.  Unfortunately, there is a well-established criminal network operating throughout Europe.  This proposal is another very important incremental step in addressing, dealing with, catching up with and, it is to be hoped, getting ahead of international organised crime.<\/p> <p>I am glad there is no opposition to the proposal from the Minister.  I was Fine Gael Seanad spokesperson on justice for nine years.  Much of the legislation is technical but extremely important.  Although it may be technical, what it is trying to achieve is fundamental.  The collaboration between agencies and the establishment of the joint committees are key to facing down the criminal elements that, unfortunately, operate not just within Europe but internationally throughout the world.  The more understandings and structures we have, the more determined we will be.  The more we work together, the more likely it is that we can address and reduce - we will never eliminate it - international organised crime to such a degree that society and the world can live in harmony in a way that is safe.  As a small country, we can lead the way in that regard.<\/p> <p>In my time in Europol and working within its structures, I and the other Irish representative from the justice committee, along with our MEPs who were on the Europol scrutiny committee, punched above our weight in ensuring that Europol was held accountable and did its job in a very focused way.  I commend the motion to the House.  I hope it will pass unanimously, as I think it will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#KK00200","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive opening statement on the motion regarding proposed approval of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council in respect of joint investigation teams.  Of course, such teams have been around for quite a while.  The regulation, in essence, proposes allowing them to set up a collaboration platform.  The platform will be a highly secure online collaboration tool aimed at facilitating exchanges and co-operation within JITs through the duration to provide them with technological support to increase their efficiency and effectiveness in cross-border investigations and prosecutions.  It will ensure those involved in JITs can more easily share information and the evidence collected in the course of their activities safely and securely with each other.<\/p> <p>The Minister gave a concrete example of the importance of this, referring to the awful tragedy in Essex involving the discovery of 39 individuals.  That investigation involved the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium and France.  They were all able to work together in that case but it is clear the Minister wants them to be able to do so in the most efficient way possible, with access to each other's information and shared data.  That is really what the motion is doing.  It is not setting up investigation teams; it is just allowing them to work much more efficiently than they did previously.<\/p> <p>Clearly, if this involves Ukraine, it is not just for EU members.  The platform will be run and administered by the EU but it is not exclusive to EU countries.  Based on my understanding of the Minister's remarks, other countries that are involved in the context of these criminal gangs or organised crime will be able to participate in this process.  What is happening in Ukraine is horrific.  Every day, the news is worse and worse.  We should be doing anything and everything we can as a European Union to help the Ukrainians pursue every single one of the perpetrators of these crimes.  That is what we are doing through this motion.  I will not delay the House.  It is a very positive motion.  I hope the other Senators who are present will speak in the same vein and light.<\/p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge for the first time the presence of Senator Clonan, our newest Senator.  He is very welcome.  It may be the first time he has been in the Chamber with this particular Minister but I am sure it will not be the last.  He is very welcome.  I hope he will be as supportive of the legislation as everybody who has spoken so far has been.  It is a positive thing.<\/p> <p>The Bill is quite technical.  As Senator Conway outlined, it is much more about the IT backup to the joint investigations teams.   The teams have already been doing their work.  The motion aims to make it easier for them to work together and faster to take those involved in organised crime and criminality generally out of the loop and the system, and to protect the rest of us.  I commend the motion on my behalf and that of Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#KK00300","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I apologise for missing her opening contribution.  I was at a private briefing of the foreign affairs committee.  Oireachtas Members have spoken often on the challenges faced by society here in Ireland, South and North, and across the EU as criminal organisations develop organisationally and technologically in pursuit of their criminal behaviour across EU borders.  Unfortunately, technological know-how and skills are not solely the preserve of law-abiding people.<\/p> <p>The objectives of this proposal are primarily twofold - the recognition of the importance of setting up joint investigation teams for specific criminal investigations and for a limited period of time, and the upgrading of the IT system across the EU to support the JITs in their investigations.  Where appropriate, and shaped to meet the specific nature of the criminal investigation, JITs have the capacity to create no-go zones for criminals across the land and sea borders of the EU.  In those circumstances, it will blend fluently the exchange of information and documents between courts, national authorities and justice and home affairs agencies.  The motion allows for two or more member states of the EU to collaborate and, where legally permissible, non-EU states as well.<\/p> <p>JITs are one of the most successful tools for cross-border investigations and prosecutions in the European Union.  They enable direct co-operation and communication between judicial and law enforcement authorities in various states to organise their actions and investigations to efficiently investigate cross-border cases.  However, they have been facing several difficulties, particularly on the technological front.  These difficulties are IT-related in the electronic exchange of information and evidence, including large files, secure electronic communication with other JIT members and bodies such as Eurojust, Europol and the anti-fraud office, as well as the joint daily management of JITs.  On examination of the effectiveness of the JITs by a relevant authority, it was proposed they be supported by a dedicated IT platform.  The IT platform will enable its members to securely communicate among themselves.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The platform would be available to all JIT members, member states' representatives, third country representatives and the Union's competent bodies in the security field.  The platform would be of a voluntary nature and complementary to other security measures employed by the relevant state.  It would be available in all EU languages and accessible through computers and mobile devices.<\/p><p>The platform would have two distinctive elements - a centralised information system and a communication software.  Particular attention should be given to the platform's access rights.  Granting access to information stored in the platform would be the strict preserve of the JIT space administrators from the JIT participating states.  At least, that is how it should be.  Given the highly sensitive nature of the information exchanged, it is essential that the safeguards are impenetrable and in keeping with strong cyber security standards.  Although it is a complex and complicated process, the platform's success will also depend on it being as simple to access as possible.<\/p><p>It is also important to acknowledge that the platform proposal, in all its dimensions, is compatible with fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights and the other human rights obligations under international law.  It is my belief that the proposal is credible in its intent and, if well managed, it should assist the people of Ireland and the rest of the EU to live safer lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#KK00400","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Clonan and invite him to speak if he wishes.

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire and at the start I thank the Minister, his advisers and officials for their help.  I thank the parliamentary legal service for its help on the Bill as well as those in the Defence Forces to whom I have spoken about this matter.  Our Defence Forces deserve the respect of the Members in these Houses and we take enormous pride in the contribution the Defence Forces make.  It is a professional body of men and women who serve this country, both home and abroad.<\/p><p>The Minister has the Report of the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces, which is presented to him with a number of options, all of which will require investment.  There is a consensus within the House that we must address the broader question around the terms and conditions of those who serve.  They are very important debates and we look forward to having them with the Minister.  They are, however, debates for another day.  This debate is very much about respect for the title of the organisation of those who serve.  At the outset it must be made clear there is only one &quot;&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann&quot;, and that is our Defence Forces.<\/p><p>In many ways there should not be a need to protect the title but we know, unfortunately, that it has been abused and misused by certain groups.  Quite frequently, that is correctly viewed as an insult to the Defence Forces and, in many ways, to the State itself.  The principle of the Bill is to protect the title &quot;&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann&quot;, and it would make it an offence to use the title of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann in contemporary circumstances where it is referring to anything other than the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>Provisions in this Bill would not apply to those who legitimately use it when we are talking about the Defence Forces.  If we are talking about support or representative organisations of current or former members, or partners of Defence Forces members or dependants of same, its provisions would not apply.  The provisions would not apply in an historical context, such as if we speak about those involved in pre-truce or post-truce military service.  This is defined in the Bill with respect to the Army Pensions Act 1932, for example.  We should be very clear about this.  The Bill is not aiming to affect the &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann we all know played a very important role in Irish history a century ago.<\/p><p>The aim of the legislation would apply very clearly to contemporary Ireland, from this point, and it would deal with dissident groups and others that would try falsely to link the activities of certain individuals to the noble actions of those who fought for Ireland a century ago.  I hope all parties and none within this House will recognise there is only one &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  I was quite gratified that ,in February 2021, Deputy David Cullinane of Sinn F&eacute;in stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere is only one &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann and that is the Irish Army.  That is my view and that is Sinn F&eacute;in's view. <\/blockquote> <p>I welcomed the declaration at the time because it is important for any political party operating here to respect the title of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  I hope in Sinn F&eacute;in's response to the principle of the Bill - I hope the same for all parties in here - the position will be upheld.  I hope Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, will make it clear there is only one &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, which is the Defence Forces.  As part of the Sinn F&eacute;in contribution, I hope he will ask the members and supporters of Sinn F&eacute;in not to abuse the title of &quot;&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann&quot; and that in contemporary Ireland it should only refer to the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>I appreciate fully that, with dissident groups, it is difficult to try to enforce measures when people misuse the name.  It is one of the challenges in bringing forward this Bill.  I am quite certain no political party in this House would want to associate with any of those dissident groups that have tried to undermine the peace process.  Sadly, we still see them in existence on this island.<\/p><p>From speaking to officials in the Department of Defence, I am aware there are a number of issues within the Bill.  I am quite happy to work with the Department and colleagues around the House to address a number of those issues on Committee Stage.  It is the appropriate forum at which to tease out some of the detail of the Bill.  The ultimate goal of the legislation and the reason it is on the floor of the House today is the protection of the title &quot;&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann&quot;.  It is the principle of the Bill and it is about respect for and protection of that title.  We owe it to the Defence Forces to achieve that aim.  It is for that reason I am proposing the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#PP00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I second the proposal from Fianna F&aacute;il.

It is important that this motion is agreed to ensure that the history and stoicism of the Defence Forces are protected now and for future generations.  It only takes a simple glance at the Defence Forces website, news outlets or the history books to see the long and proud history of our forces.  As many Members will know, I am a passionate advocate for the Defence Forces and I have always used my influence and voice to champion the cause of the Defence Forces community in Kildare and nationally.  The call to serve one's country is something that cannot be matched.  We are very privileged and honoured to serve our country within the Houses of the Oireachtas but having the opportunity to serve the country within the Defence Forces is an equal honour.<\/p><p>I regularly meet with active and retired members of the Defence Forces, as well as representative bodies, and I am always amazed by their sense of duty, national pride and their commitment to the State and its people.  I mention PDFORRA in particular.  Its members are an incredible group of people and the work they do representing their men and women on the ground is exemplary.  &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann is a remarkable organisation that has its roots deep in the fabric of this nation.  We have all heard stories of the dedication of its members.  Many of us have great affection and respect for members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, both past and present.<\/p><p>Hailing from south Kildare, our role and involvement in the defence community is something that we hold very dear to our hearts.  Many communities in south Kildare rely heavily on members of the Defence Forces, who serve not only our communities but our nation with distinction.  The Curragh Camp is home to 2,000 military personnel and is the main training centre for the Irish Defence Forces.  People choose to enter &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann to serve this State, in order to further the cause of the Irish people, and to pledge their support for our nation.  That is why they enlist, put themselves in harm's way and sacrifice so much.  They do this in the service of the State and the flag.  As legislators, we must ensure that what they do, which they do solely in the name of this State, is sacrosanct - not in the name of a fringe group or an alternative military force or anything else.  They deserve the respect of a legally protected title and that is what the Bill does.  It is of concern that the title is not protected.  This legislation will make it an offence to use the terms &quot;&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann&quot; or &quot;Defence Forces&quot; in any context other than where it applies to the Defence Forces in this country.  We cannot allow any organisation, political party or militia group usurp that title for its own cause.<\/p><p>The defence community serves on the shoulders of its predecessors.  They serve at the pleasure of this State and they advance a long, proud and dignified history of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  They are building on the legacy of heroes gone before them.  The main issue being addressed by the Bill is that there is only one Irish defence force, made up of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  Without this Bill, there would be no legislation stopping anyone using the term.  This legislation is needed to stop the use of the title in any context other than referencing the legal actions and structure of the Irish Defence Forces.  The Bill proposes the amendment of the Defence Act 1954 and will add a new section, which will ensure that it is an offence for anyone, without lawful authority, to establish a body of any description which uses either of the titles, &quot;&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann&quot; or &quot;Defence Forces&quot;.  Senator Malcolm Byrne has referenced this.  Any person found guilty of this offence may be charged with a class D fine.<\/p><p>I am pleased to see that the Bill does have exemptions for a variety of reasons for historical use of the term to former members of the Defence Forces.  It is also welcome that it does not apply to veterans' organisations of the Permanent Defence Force or representative associations of other ranks such as PDFORRA, which I mentioned, that represents in excess of 6,500 members of the Defence Forces.  Likewise, the Bill does not apply to the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO.  Both organisations are highly important in representing the rights and interests of those who serve Ireland under the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces have been under-resourced, ignored and have not always been shown the respect they deserve.  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which was unveiled recently, is very welcome.  We need to hear the thoughts of the Minister on the recommendations that are made in the report and they must be implemented.  The Bill is one aspect of showing the respect that is needed and deserved, and in enshrining the hard-fought legacy in the Statute Book.<\/p><p>I reiterate my calls in the Seanad for a permanent pay review body to be established as an absolute priority.  It is hard to speak of issues relating to the Defence Forces and not point out the glaring resource issues and pay and conditions for personnel.  That includes the opportunity for them to join the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  That is really important.<\/p><p>The implementation of the findings of the Commission on the Defence Forces must be tackled and commenced.  We must deal with the cultural issues that were raised and we must support personnel at every stage of the transformation agenda.  I will fight to ensure the recommendations are implemented and that the defence community in south Kildare and throughout the country is shown the respect it deserves.<\/p><p>ICTU membership is a vital component that needs to be addressed.  Without the right of affiliation we risk excluding the very people we wish to include from talks on vital pay and conditions.  However, to return specifically to the Bill at hand, we must honour, support and respect the Defence Forces.  I will finish with a direct quote from the Defence Forces:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSince its inception the Defence Forces, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, have faithfully maintained a strong ethos and a set of values that have ensured a continuous and exemplary level of professionalism at home and abroad.  The Defence Forces ethos of continued volunteer service to the State and the six values of respect, loyalty, selflessness, physical courage, moral courage and integrity form the bedrock of the organisation and are central to our effectiveness.  They are fundamental to sustaining &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann as a steadfast pillar of the Irish State. <\/blockquote> <p>Only one organisation can be associated with these values, this ethos and this service to our people, that is, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, our Defence Forces.  I am very happy to second the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#QQ01000","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>The Minister has indicated that he would like to come in.

I am also sure that we would all be concerned at any attempt by any person or organisation to lay claim to, or to represent themselves as, the lawfully raised Defence Forces of the State which, under section 16 of the Defence Act 1954, are to be called and known as \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\". <\/p><p>I wish to advise the House that the Government will therefore not be opposing the Bill on Second Stage.  The Government fully respects and supports the intent of the Bill.  However, there are major issues around the construction of the Bill as currently drafted and the extent to which it can successfully address the objectives of the proposers in protecting the title in a legally enforceable manner.  There will, therefore, be a requirement to bring forward substantive Government amendments on Committee Stage to address certain difficulties identified following a review of the legislation by my Department and the Attorney General's office. <\/p><p>This Bill, as it stands, endeavours to address an issue that I am very much aware has been a sensitive one and has been raised on many occasions over the years.  Successive Governments, Members of the Oireachtas, the Defence Forces and, indeed, many political commentators have expressed objections to the use of the title \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" by non-Defence Forces institutions and, most particularly, by paramilitary and dissident organisation.  Since the enactment of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923, the official Irish name of the Defence Forces of the State has been \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\".  As such, the Defence Forces remain the only organisation entitled to use this term. <\/p><p>In brief, the focus of the proposed Bill is to amend the Defence Act 1954 to insert a new section 258A to provide that it shall be an offence for a person without lawful authority to establish a body of any description which uses either of the titles \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" or \"Defence Forces\" and, second, for a person to join or act as a member of any such organisation.<\/p><p>The Bill further provides that a person found guilty of an offence under this new section will be liable on summary conviction to a class D fine, which is to a maximum of &euro;1,000.   In addition, the Bill contains a wide range of exemptions for organisations using the titles in question for various purposes, for example, historic reasons or the provision of services to serving or former members of the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>Following a review of the Bill, my Department identified a number of issues with the Bill which might potentially give rise to difficulties.  The Attorney General has also reviewed the legislation and provided legal advice confirming the Department's concerns.  Given the historical resonance of the title \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\", which dates back to the foundation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913, I am concerned that it might prove difficult, on the basis of the Bill as currently drafted, to mount a successful prosecution for the unlawful use of such title. <\/p><p>In addition, the following difficulties have been identified on the basis on an initial review of the Bill.  First, the provisions in the Bill concerning the formation of the prohibited type of body, and membership of it, would be difficult to prove in court.  Second, under the Bill it would be for the Minister for Defence to prosecute the offence, further to section 7 of the Defence Act 1954.  However, the procurement of evidence on the organisations targeted by the Bill would be complex and risk straying into the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Obviously, this provision will require further consideration and consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Justice. <\/p><p>Further consideration would also be required to be given to the exemptions from prosecution provided for in the Bill.  As currently drafted, any organisation prosecuted under the Bill is likely to claim that the exemptions provided for in the draft Bill apply to that organisation and would, potentially, be successful in that regard, thus undermining the very intent of the Bill.  Finally, an organisation prosecuted under the Bill could claim it had used the title prior to the law's enactment and, consequently, the provision could be determined to amount to a retrospective sanction.  This element of the legislation also requires further consideration. <\/p><p>Based on the advice of the Attorney General, there are substantial concerns that the Bill as currently drafted will not achieve the intent of the proposers.  The Attorney General has also raised significant doubt about the potential to mount a successful prosecution of a person or organisation under the Bill as currently drafted.  Further consideration will be required to ensure that the provisions of the Bill do not undermine the very purpose of the Bill in the first place.  I hope that everybody will work with me on that point.<\/p><p>As I stated at the outset, the Government is not opposing this Bill and, indeed, fully supports its intent.  However, delivering on that intent will require significant amendments to the current draft.  My Department will need to engage with the Attorney General's office in that regard and will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to that effect.  My Department will also be consulting with the Department of Justice and the Attorney General's office in the course of the drafting of the required Committee Stage amendments.  My Department will also engage, of course, with Senator Malcolm Byrne in advance of the Committee Stage debate.<\/p><p>It may take some time to draft those amendments given the demands on the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  However, I would like to assure Senators that I will bring forward the requisite amendments as quickly as possible.  In other words, we support what Senator Malcolm Byrne is trying to do here.  His intent is correct but the legal advice of my Department and of that provided by the Attorney General, with whom I have spoken personally in respect of this Bill, is that we believe, with the input of the Department and of the Office of the Attorney General, we can deliver on the intent of the Bill as outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#QQ01200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>That is good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#RR00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>We will work with the Senator on that to produce amendments that can be introduced on Committee Stage to try to deliver legislation that is fit for purpose and can secure the necessary prosecutions, should it come to that.

I thank the Minister for clarifying the position and for confirming that he is committed to the Bill, to what it proposes to do, and that he is prepared to put the resources of the State behind the bringing forward of any amendments that are required to make this Bill work.<\/p> <p>I am a former member of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann and am very proud of that.  I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for doing something that should have been done a long time ago to enshrine the name \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" and to make it available to only one organisation in this country.  My colleagues mentioned PDFORRA and RACO.  We should also have put the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, into the mix because during the time when I was in the Defence Forces the Reserve Defence Force was available to this State at weekends and at night when we were short of personnel and when we needed to protect the State and its citizens. <\/p> <p>It has always been a bugbear of mine and of those of us who have served that frequently we found ourselves in a situation where we were searching houses in this country during the time of the kidnapping of Tiede Herrema and Don Tidey, and that those were the houses of people who were known sympathisers of a republican movement who regarded themselves as members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  The only people who had the right to use that term were those of us who stood in the uniform of the State and who stood to protect it in every way.  It is a matter of deep regret to me that people putting themselves forward as &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann killed members of both the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the name that they were pursuing at the time, whatever the hell it was.  It is vitally important and is a matter of respect for those who serve.  I know that the Minister has been aware for some time of the Respect and Loyalty movement which exists in the country among veterans but that is a topic for another day and time.  Today is about this Bill.<\/p> <p>Former members of the Defence Forces have always resented the fact that people have used the title \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" and, indeed, have put it on headstones when the people that we are talking about were not members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, did not wear the uniform of this State, did not stand guard on the Border or on vital installations in this State, and did not disrupt the movements of terrorists who used this country to propagate attacks in Northern Ireland.  We are talking about a step in the right direction today towards respect and recognition for those who served.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

We know the Jadotville issue has gone a particular direction but there are other great deeds that were carried out by members of the Defence Forces both here in Ireland and in various other parts of the world: Lebanon, Chad and so on.  They have never been recognised for the things they did.  In a period in our history when we are pursuing restorative justice in other areas of Irish society, it would be a great act of loyalty to those who served if the Chief of Staff initiated a period of restorative justice and an examination of the history of the Defence Forces over the past 100 years to see where acts that were carried out and not recognised might be recognised now.<\/p><p>I was in Longford on Sunday at the removal of Quartermaster Sergeant Michael Tighe.  Meeting his daughters was a truly emotional event.  They spoke about Michael&rsquo;s actions both in the tunnel and Jadotville.  It is a sad situation that families believe they have been neglected and overlooked.  This is not an issue for the Minister because he cannot do anything about the type of justice of which I speak.  He is not in a position to do that.  From the first day he tries to do something like that, he will have people such as me jumping down his throat asking why he is interfering in the military.  He is the Minister and he can ask the Defence Forces to do things but it must make the decision itself.<\/p><p>Rightly or wrongly I am using my platform today to ask the Defence Forces to actually look into its own heart, as it were, and see if it has left people out, forgotten people or neglected the actions of people.  If it has, as much a part of dedicating the title \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" to the Defence Forces, we should also look at the actions of whose who served.  I hope the Defence Forces will do that.  I am very grateful to the Minister for throwing his weight behind this and that he will bring in the Office of the Attorney General.  I am grateful to the Department officials who have taken the time to go through this and to engage with other Departments to see what has to be done and bring forward the amendments.  I thank the officials for that.

I think of all our soldiers overseas, the 352 troops of the 119th Infantry Battalion who went to serve in the Lebanon last October, those who served in Israel, Syria, Mali, Congo, Bosnia, Kosovo and in various other military representations around the world, and all those who fought and died serving with our Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for the commitment he has given to maintaining and bringing our Defence Forces up to an agreed strength of 9,500, which is extremely difficult but I welcome the commitment given by Government to doing that and bringing in schemes to incentivise people to join our Defence Forces.

We have a precious peace, but it is not a perfect peace.  When it is not a perfect peace, it means much more work has to be done in the area of truth, reconciliation and healing.  There are safe assumptions such as those my friend, Senator Carrigy, makes when he says that when he thinks of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, he thinks of General Se&aacute;n Mac Eoin, or when Senator Craughwell says he served in &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  I have no doubt the &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann he served in is the real and only one, but in other parts of Ireland, people would not see it that way.  They served in a different &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  I am not asking Members to agree or to appreciate that but I am asking them to try to see it through that prism, unpalatable as it may be.  It is only when we reach deep into where other people are coming from that we will reach a genuine authentic peace.  The peace process, which is an ongoing project, may well take a step forward in healing this evening.  I do not like to make predictions but it might well be that this motion may not be opposed today.  That is a huge step forward.  It would have been unimaginable 20, ten or five years ago.<\/p> <p>Parliamentarians in this Chamber are all old enough to remember the slogan, the ballot box in one hand and the Armalite in the other hand.  That is the context.  That is a long journey for people to travel in two respects.  It is a seismic shift to be signing a press release with P. O&rsquo;Neill, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann on it.  That was in a different Ireland, thank God.  They will make mistakes and get things wrong on that journey.  We do not have to love them but we have to reach out, listen, try to understand where they are coming from and build up some respect.<\/p> <p>Equally, on the journey are the die-hard parliamentarians and democrats who stood by the flag through all those years of bitter pain when members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in most towns in this country went out, left their families and never came home.  I know all about the hurt that caused.  I know one member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who died in 1983, and his mother, now deceased, never recovered.  That is damage it did.<\/p> <p>Let us not expect too much.  On this journey, do not expect modernisation.  It may be a form of modification.  If that modification is genuine, I am not asking people to embrace it but to work with it.  As that modified force in Irish politics gets stronger and seemingly stronger again, it is important that people never take cheap political shots at it out of envy.

Each and every one of the points made by the Minister would appear to be statable, plausible and credible.  He is right to take the best possible advice.  In my humble opinion, however, none of those points would prove to me to be legally insurmountable, nor has the Minister said otherwise.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne has started a journey by adding a piece to the jigsaw.

I accept that the term \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" applies to the Defence Forces.  While I do not have the same experience of the Defence Forces as others, either in terms of membership or their input into the life of my community and city and the world around me, since coming into this Seanad in 2016, I have always endeavoured to be a champion advocate for the Defence Forces and their needs.  I commend, acknowledge and recognise their members' bravery, commitment and service.<\/p> <p>I am pretty convinced that this is not the most pressing issue currently facing the Defence Forces.  I say respectfully to the proposers that it would have been a much better use of all of our parliamentary time to debate the failures of successive Governments to deal with the real issues facing the Defence Forces around pay and conditions and the lack of supports for veterans and their families.<\/p> <p>At a recent visit to the Curragh Camp with colleagues from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence - I think Senator Wall was there - I heard some stark contributions from soldiers.  Some of them told me that they were actively considering leaving the Defence Forces to sign on.  Some told me their children were now earning more money than they were.  Some also said that despite being fit and healthy, they had aged out and could not longer go overseas with the Defence Forces and thereby modestly increase their money.  Those were the issues that were conveyed to me and, I am sure, other colleagues just a few weeks ago.<\/p> <p>This Bill is what we are discussing tonight, however.  I accept that.  That is the issue Fianna F&aacute;il has put before us, as is its prerogative.  That is fair enough.   On the legislation, I, too, have concerns at this stage around its competency and the Minister referred to his concerns.  The term \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" is spelled out as the name of the Defence Forces in the Constitution.  I accept that and it would seem to me that it affords legal protection.<\/p> <p>All that said, I am more than happy to see the Bill move to the next Stage of the legislative process to examine whether it can be amended and improved.  The Minister gave a signal of intent to bring forward necessary amendments.  I have no doubt, as with many other issues pertaining to the Defence Forces, he will find a willing ear and people willing to co-operate with him right across this Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#TT00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

The previous time the Minister was in the House, I was in the Chair.  We discussed the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  At that stage, the Minister indicated he would come before us again to discuss the findings of that report.  I know he has had an opportunity to discuss it with Deputies in the Lower House.  I ask that such an opportunity be offered to Members of the Upper House.<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware that a number of us have repeatedly spoken to him about issues surrounding our Defence Forces.  Those issues continue to this day.  We read the positive and hopeful news that the Cabinet is discussing offering an extra &euro;1 billion to the Defence Forces.  Will the Minister confirm discussions on that type of money are taking place Cabinet?  Perhaps when he comes back, he will have some good news for our Defence Forces.<\/p><p>I cannot let the opportunity to raise the issue of affiliation pass.  I raised it in the House the other day, and it was raised earlier by my colleague in County Kildare, Senator O'Loughlin.  I ask the Minister, as Senator Craughwell has done on numerous occasions, to give the House an update on affiliation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, by PDFORRA and RACO, should they wish to affiliate.  We are hearing that pay talks have been triggered.  Now is the time for the Minister to tell us he will allow PDFORRA to affiliate once and for all.  I cannot see why there should be a barrier to that.  The Minister said he did not see a barrier but that he had to be convinced.  What is needed to convince him?  That is the question many of us are asking.  Affiliation is in place in almost every other European country.  Now is the time to allow it in Ireland as well.<\/p><p>I want to bring up one other issue with the Minister.

Nomenclature is very important.  I was a member of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann and am very proud of my service.  It is very important in an era of fake news, propaganda and uncertainty that we should avoid at all costs a situation where any group or grouping might exploit the good name of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann either to cause confusion, sow dissent or in any way to politicise the identity of that organisation.

Looking at the Order of Business on my first day, I was particularly interested in it.<\/p> <p>I am sure the Minister will not thank me for raising this at the first opportunity but I am aware that the principal concern among my former colleagues is pay and conditions.

If I were to use one word to describe what it is about, it would be \"respect\", that is, respect for the institutions of the State.  Since independence and the seminal moment of the handover of Dublin Castle to our Army and the raising of the Tricolour, we have had one armed force in this State.  It is right and proper that the correct title would be applied to the Defence Forces and would only be used to describe them.  They are, as outlined in the Bill, the forces \"raised and maintained under the Defence Acts 1954 to 2015\".  In essence, the Bill is about respect for a very important institution of our State, which has been a symbol of our independence since the foundation of the State and of our security and protection thereafter.  I certainly commend it.  There have been elements in this country who have not been recognising of the State and our institutions and who would use the term \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" to describe forces other than the Army.  I support the recognition of the proper use of the term, as described.<\/p> <p>A number of weeks ago, I attended a ceremony marking the 100 years since the handover of the former Renmore Barracks in Galway, now D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa Barracks, to the Irish State.  It was a nice ceremony, as such Defence Forces events always are.  They put on a good show, as it were, demonstrating their professionalism and the respect and courtesy they have for the flag and the institutions.  The occasions are always moving, whether they be the Easter 1916 ceremonies or other such events.  The Defence Forces put on a professional event, with invitations for people living locally and former members and their families.  It is particularly important when we consider those who have lost their lives while serving abroad that the correct and proper name is used to describe the Defence Forces and to describe only them.<\/p> <p>Like other speakers, I hope the Minister will be back to discuss the whole area of defence.  For some months now, starting with the incursions in our economic waters and the stance he, the Government and, indeed, the fishermen in the south east took, there has been a need for such discussion.  With all that has happened in Ukraine and the publication of the independent report, it is high time that we have a larger debate on defence, NATO and neutrality.  I hope the Minister will return at an early date to have that debate.  I congratulate Senator Malcolm Byrne and others on their work on the Bill.  I hope it can progress quickly and that whatever amendments are proposed by the Government will be debated and taken on board to strengthen this very symbolic and important, although technical, Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#UU00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with my colleague, Senator McGreehan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#UU00300","speaker":"1687"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

He joins the House as a distinguished academic and also a former member of the Defence Forces.  We know he will bring that expertise to any discussion we have on the Defence Forces.

I am aware of the significant work the Defence Forces carry out on our behalf on a daily basis.  They do so covertly.  An old county manager of mine once said to me that the reason the waterworks and sewerage works are the last to get funding in every council is because the work that goes on cannot be seen.  Our Army does a fantastic job covertly.  Perhaps we should start doing more to highlight the important work it does.<\/p> <p>I am fully supportive of this Bill.

I congratulate my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, on bringing forward this Bill.  It is long overdue.  When one considers the history of this country and the men and women who wore this uniform, it is a Bill of respect.  It is about standing up for democracy, being proud of our soldiers and institutions and standing tall alongside our Army and democratic institutions.  I am deeply saddened that the name &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann has been disrespected and dishonoured for decades by terrorist organisations.  We have a proud tradition of Defence Forces in this country.  We all know there is only one legitimate Army.<\/p> <p>I think about the proud origins of our soldiers and Defence Forces and their early beginnings in our State a century ago as &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  I have to remember some Louth people who lost their lives and served with great dignity in our Army.  Sean Magee, was a young officer in pre-Independence times who was murdered by the Black and Tans.  Two years later, James Boyle, a member of the national Army, was killed during an ambush during the Civil War.  We honour these men.  We honour Private Michael McNeela, who lost his young life serving in 1986 in Lebanon.  It would also be remiss of me not to mention Lieutenant General Se&aacute;n Mac Eoin, who was born but 200 m down from my own home.  He was an officer who entered in the Army in 1930 and was commissioned the following year.<\/p> <p>It is this proud legacy as a proud, distinguished service that makes this Bill so important.  This Bill is a symbol of respect, but we also need that symbol of respect translated into actions.  We have to have more than respect.  We need to look after all our serving and retired Army officers. <\/p> <p>When I see the gravestones and headstones of Provisional IRA members using the name of this great country&rsquo;s Army on their headstones, abusing and insulting a legitimate Army, bastardising and denigrating the name of our Army in the same way they do our flag, it is both upsetting and infuriating.  I welcome the acknowledgement that we have only one Army in this country.  However, I would ask a question that I would like to have answered because we have not had a clear answer.  They purport to support this Bill and say we have only one Army and recognise that.  One side does that and the other side does not recognise the State, the Constitution and the background to that State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#VV00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Does the Minister want to make a brief remark at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#VV00300","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I do not think I can come back because I am not the sponsoring person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#VV00400","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators who contributed to this discussion because it is an important matter.  Any time we have had a debate on defence matters, the Minister has come into this House regularly.  He takes his responsibilities with that portfolio very seriously, as he does with his responsibilities in foreign affairs.  For that, we are grateful.  Like colleagues, I look forward to those debates on those other very important defence issues.<\/p> <p>I respectfully disagree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile when he said this was the issue we chose to raise on Private Members&rsquo; business because, like other colleagues in all parties and none, we have all be raising Defence Forces issues.  However, this is one that has rankled for a long time.  Indeed, in the Minister&rsquo;s address, he acknowledged the fact this has been raised by Members of the Oireachtas, Ministers, Deputies, Senators and political commentators.  Most importantly, it has been raised by members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  Serving and former members get particularly annoyed at how the title of the Defence Forces is abused and misused and they want it to be protected.<\/p> <p>When I started in the drafting of this legislation, I thought it was possibly going to be a bit easier than it turned out to be because we regularly protect other titles of professions and so on, and it is much easier to be able to do it.  The word &ldquo;university&rdquo;, for instance, is a protected title.  Given the historical nature of the title \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\", that presented quite a number of difficulties.  As we worked through the legislation, I certainly found there were a number of challenges.  I am very happy and it is appropriate that, on Committee State, we work in a collaborative way with the Minister, his officials and in a cross-party way to ensure we achieve the objectives of this Bill.  I understand the time pressures that are on Parliamentary Counsel, but I would certainly hope that within the lifetime of this Oireachtas, we finally enact legislation that protects the title &ldquo;&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>It is also not just about legislation.  This is about that broader question around us all respecting the title and speaking it with respect.  I reiterate the call to Sinn F&eacute;in and others to make sure the members of every political party in this House only use the title \"&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann\" when referring to the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>The word that was most used during the course of this debate this evening was &ldquo;respect&rdquo;.  The motivation behind this legislation is respect for those, including Members of both Houses and our family and friends, who have served within the Defence Forces.  We have enormous respect for them.  It is appropriate we would enact legislation that recognises and protects the title of the forces in which they serve.<\/p> <p>I welcome the support of all political parties and none in this House for this Bill.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment and contribution.  I appreciate there is much work that will have to be done on Committee Stage.  I ask that we would try to move on it as quickly as possible.  I keep thinking it is a relatively simple area of work, but the more we look at it, it is quite complex.  It is ultimately about achieving a very simple goal.  If we can do that in the lifetime of this Oireachtas, we will be showing enormous respect to those men and women who have served in the past and continue to serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#VV00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649235000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#VV00700","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.

I wish him the very best of luck as he takes his seat.  It is a great achievement for him and his family.<\/p><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022.  I thank Senators for facilitating the passage of this important substitute consent legislation through the House.  The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 at Part X(a) relating to substitute consent procedures.  Substitute consent is a process that concerns applications seeking to regularise existing developments requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment, EIA, or appropriate assessment, AA, in exceptional circumstances.  The Bill seeks to streamline the process to provide for a single-stage application process and achieves this by the deletion of the initial leave to apply stage.<\/p><p>The amendments in the present Bill follow on from prior amendments to the substitute consent process introduced by sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Planning and Development Act and the Residential Tenancies Act 2020, No. 27 of 2020, as enacted on 19 December 2020.  This 2020 legislation was introduced as an initial interim response to the Supreme Court judgment issued on 1 July 2020 in the Ballysax <i>v<\/i>. McQuaid cases, which were three joint appeal cases relating to two quarries, namely, An Taisce <i>v<\/i>. An Bord Plean&aacute;la, An Taisce <i>v<\/i>. An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Sweetman <i>v<\/i>. An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The 2020 Act amendments ensured that the findings of the judgment were addressed and the issue of exceptional circumstances in each substitute consent application case would be considered not only in the initial leave-to-apply stage but also at the substantive application stage, which involves full public participation.  In deciding exceptional circumstances, the board must consider a number of prescribed matters, including whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the EIA directive or the habitats directive and whether the applicant could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised.  The 2020 Act amendments, in effect, render the initial leave-to-apply stage, which did not include public participation, redundant.  This Bill's proposed deletion of the redundant leave-to-apply stage has ensured that the 2000 Act has retained all of the established criteria that the board as a competent authority is required to consider when determining whether exceptional circumstances exist in substitute consent applications on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>Related amendments are also proposed to section 34(12) of the 2000 Act to clarify provisions allowing planning authorities and the board to screen an application for retention permission for EIA and AA and to refuse to consider applications for retention of unauthorised developments where either EIA or AA are screened in, in which case the applicant can only consider the substitute consent process.  Amendments are also proposed to extend section 37(l) of the planning Act, which currently allows simultaneous applications for any future development to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, along with substitute consent applications for certain quarries.  The present amendment to section 37(l) will allow for simultaneous applications being made in respect of all types of developments.  This amendment seeks to encourage the regularisation and remediation of unauthorised developments as well as allowing an integrated assessment by the board of such related proposals, which will also be of benefit for the understanding of the public.  However, it should be noted that if the substitute consent application is refused, the future development proposal must also be refused.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In addition to my comments on the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022, I wish to inform the House that I intend to introduce further Government amendments as the Bill makes it way through the legislative process on Committee Stage.  These amendments relate not only to the planning legislation but to other legislation under the remit of my Department.  I will, therefore, outline the position on each of these amendments, with the first three amendments relating to the planning Act.  <br\/><br\/>The first amendment relates to ministerial directions regarding statutory plans and related provisions.  Technical amendments to section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, relating to ministerial directions regarding statutory plans and related provisions are being examined by my Department to address inconsistencies and to ensure the effective operation of the section 31 process as it applies to statutory plans made, amended or varied by planning authorities and regional assemblies under the Act.  <br\/><br\/>The second amendment relates to flexibility in regard to planning applications.  This amendment would provide that planning applications may include a limited number of design options, where such details or specifications are unknown or cannot be confirmed at the time of the application.  The amendment is intended to provide clarity on foot of a recent High Court judgment in a planning-related judicial review case and to ensure that a certain degree of flexibility at planning application stage can be maintained, with appropriate safeguards for the public consultation phase and environmental assessment to ensure that sufficient clarity is provided for the planning authority and stakeholders.  My Department is working with the Office of the Attorney General with regard to progressing this Committee Stage amendment.<br\/><br\/>The third amendment relates to judicial review.  The previous Government approved a general scheme of a Bill which included some amendments to the judicial review process.  The programme for Government refers to this in tandem with the establishment of the planning and environmental law court, which will be a division of the High Court.  A working group, led by the Department of Justice, is leading on the court establishment issue.  While public consultation advanced on the Bill, it has not yet been subject to pre-legislative scrutiny.  The review of the planning Act, being led by the Attorney General, has a specific work stream on judicial review.  At this stage, it is envisaged that substantive changes would advance through that process.  However, in the interim the Minister is considering whether some straightforward elements of the planning and development (judicial review) Bill could be incorporated as amendments to this Bill as it progresses through the Oireachtas.  This would include aspects such as ensuring that all administrative reviews or appeals processes should be exhausted before a referral to the courts.  This would be in line with the reference to this process within the environmental impact assessment directive.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The following proposed Committee Stage amendments relate to legislation other than the planning Act<b>. <\/b>I propose to bring forward amendments to the Affordable Housing Act 2021 relating to affordable purchase scheme.  Part 2 of the Act provides for the establishment of a local authority-led affordable purchase scheme.  It contains a provision where the local authority equity interest in the home it makes available is registerable as a burden in the Land Registry portfolio.  A technical amendment will now be made to register this interest as an inhibition rather than a burden.  <br\/><br\/>Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides the basis for the first home affordable purchase shared equity scheme, which will be available nationwide.  The scheme, which is intended will be introduced from the end of quarter 2, will support first-time buyers on moderate incomes in purchasing new-build homes in private developments by means of an equity share model.  It is proposed to make a technical amendment to Part 4, inserting a new section 41A.  On the advice of the Attorney General, it is considered necessary and prudent to bring forward an amendment to provide a clear and explicit legal basis for the registration and removal of a beneficial interest.  This will be in the form of an inhibition in the same manner as the local authority affordable purchase scheme under Part 2.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will also bring forward amendments to the residential tenancies and valuation ActsThese proposed amendments are to section 14 of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 and section 21 of the Valuation Act 2001, with possible consequential amendments to sections 23 and 60 of the 2001 Act as they relate to the national revaluation programme.  The proposed amendments are intended to facilitate the Commissioner of Valuation to postpone the roll-out of the revaluation of rateable properties as a result of the effects of Covid-19 restrictions during 2020 and 2021.  This decision will require amending legislation to allow for existing valuation orders to be wound up and new valuation orders to be made for rating authorities. <br\/><br\/>The Minister is also considering legal advices regarding the necessity for technical amendments to the Foreshore Act 1933 to deal with the potential issues arising with the assessment of applications as prescribed under the Act, which technical amendments brought forward by way of Committee Stage amendments to this Bill.<br\/><br\/>The Bill, as initiated, is needed to streamline the important substitute consent procedures for applications to regularise existing developments requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment.  Public consultation is a critical component of planning legislation.  My Department committed to the Oireachtas joint committee in the pre-legislative scrutiny process to extend the public consultation period for substitute consent applications from five to eight weeks.  This detail is not included in the Bill, as details such as the minimum length of public consultation periods for planning applications are contained in secondary planning regulations, namely, the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.  I will amend these regulations to introduce an eight-week consultation period for substitute consent applications later this year at the same time as the commencement of the enacted Bill.  I look forward to hearing Senators' views on the legislation.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#BBB00700","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I thank him and his officials for bringing forward this short but important and complex legislation.  It is important in the context of regularising and, in the case of unauthorised development, remediating developments such as quarries that may have cropped up over the course of a significant period of time without planning permission.  This legislation was given quite an airing at the Oireachtas joint committee late last year.  I thank the Minister of State's officials for briefing members of the committee on the provisions of the legislation.  As stated by the Minister of State, this Bill follows on from the interim amendments made in 2020 as a result of the Ballysax and McQuaid cases, which legislation was enacted at the end of 2020.  This legislation builds on that and puts it on a permanent and statutory footing, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>I had proposed to keep my comments relatively short but as the Minister of State has informed the House of the significant number of amendments to be brought forward by Government in the areas of statutory plans, judicial reviews, affordable purchase, the revaluation programme and in regard to the foreshore Act, I would like to comment in anticipation of those amendments.  <\/p> <p>The Minister of State referenced the programme for Government commitment in regard to the judicial review and the work that is ongoing by the Attorney General in that regard.  It is welcome that elements of that may be brought forward as part of this legislation, to ensure that in the administrative reviews all avenues would be pursued before it becomes necessary to go the judicial review route.  I welcome any changes that would enhance the affordable purchase scheme and the first-home affordable purchase shared equity scheme, which will be in place by 1 July, as confirmed at an Oireachtas joint committee meeting a couple of weeks ago.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The first-home shared equity scheme is a very important element of Housing For All, which will bridge the gap between the purchase price and the maximum mortgage amount that an individual, a couple or a family is able to get from a pillar bank or a housing loan through a local authority.  It is also important to put on the record of the House that there are many in the Opposition who are opposed to that scheme which will help so many people in getting their foot on the ladder for the first time, and that is obviously regrettable.<\/p><p>I refer to the affordable purchase scheme through the local authorities.  Three schemes have been approved in my local authority area of Waterford, some of the first in partnership with developers, that will see units delivered for families in this calendar year, which is hugely welcome.  The regulation on the criteria for the selection of those homes is due to be published by the end of the week.<\/p><p>I look forward to teasing out the amendments further on Committee Stage in regard to the revaluation programme.  I am sure any moves that will assist and streamline that process will be welcomed by the local authority sector.  One of the issues that I experienced during my time in local government was when a new premises was established with a company operating, possibly a multinational corporation, if it was completed in the middle of the year, it was not valued until the following year.  This means the local authority did not get any income from rates until the following year.  Perhaps that could be taken on board by the Minister of State if it is not already being incorporated as part of the amendments the Government has in mind.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill.

I teach classes of postgraduate students, the most wonderful young people in their mid-20s and, increasingly, none of them have the very modest aspiration of owning their own home or apartment.  That is something I know everybody in this House and the D&aacute;il is anxious to work on.  We need to fix that because shelter and a home is a functional prerequisite.  It is a fundamental human right in the UN Charter.  If we do not have that functional prerequisite, we have by definition a dysfunctional society.  I am glad to see the work that is being done.  I know there is disagreement on the shared equity scheme and other elements of the Minister's proposals, but at least we are of one mind in terms of our focus in that regard.<\/p> <p>I thank the House for welcoming me here as the University of Dublin Senator.  Even though I am a Trinity graduate, like the Minister of State, I am a Christian Brothers boy from Finglas, not from Mullingar, but I do have relatives not from Kinnegad.  I know the Minister of State cannot vote for me but they might be able to vote for him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#DDD00200","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>They are all welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#DDD00300","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I will have to do my research.

I compliment Senator Clonan.  I was not here the other day, but it was nice to hear him say a few words on this debate and I am sure he will make many valuable contributions to the House in his time here.<\/p> <p>Naturally, Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this Bill which concerns the substitute consent regime of Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The Bill's purpose, as the Minister of State pointed out, is essentially to streamline the substitute consent procedure in the planning system.  Streamlining of the substitute consent regime is required to increase the efficiency and utility of the process in order to safeguard confidence in the Irish planning system by eliminating a surplus step in the substitute consent process.  We all believe that to be important.  It will also ensure that the system is fully in compliance with EU environmental requirements and recent court judgments.  In this context, it is proposed to provide for a single-stage application process under the remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This would replace the current two-stage process.<\/p> <p>It is also proposed to amend section 37L of the planning Act, as the Minister of State mentioned, which currently allows simultaneous applications to be made for certain quarry developments for both future development and substitute consent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the same time, so that simultaneous applications will be open to all types of development.<\/p> <p>Amendments are proposed, as referred, to section 34(12) of the Act, to require planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to screen an application or an appeal for retention permission for an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or appropriate assessment, AA, and to refuse to consider applications for retention of unauthorised development where either an EIA or AA are screened in.<\/p> <p>The amendments to the Bill supplement the amendments introduced in December 2020 under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.  The amendments of December 2020 obliged the board to consider whether exceptional circumstances exist at the substantive substitute consent application stage in order to justify a grant of substitute consent, which ensures that this consideration of exceptional circumstances is subject to full public participation at the substantive application stage.  Previously, exceptional circumstances had only been considered at the initial application for leave stage, which stage does not provide for public participation.  The European Union&rsquo;s EIA directive requires that projects likely to have significant environmental effects must undergo an EIA before development consent is given.  In 2008, the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, in case C-215\/06 found that Ireland's planning provisions that facilitated retention permission applications for existing developments, in other words, retrospective applications for consent, where such developments also required an EIA was contrary to EU law.  Accordingly, section 34(12) of the planning Act was amended in 2011 so that planning authorities cannot accept applications for retention of unauthorised development where, had an application been made before development had commenced, it would have required an EIA, an EIA screening determination or an appropriate assessment.<\/p> <p>The CJEU judgment at the same time did recognise that EU law does not preclude regularisation of unauthorised EIA developments in exceptional circumstances provided that this does not facilitate the circumvention or evasion of EU environmental obligations.  In this context, the \"substitute consent\" facility under Part XA of the planning Act was introduced and became effective in September 2011.<\/p> <p>Substitute consent procedures under Part XA of the Act allow for the regularisation and the undertaking of retrospective EIA or AA of development that has already been carried out.  Substitute consent applications are determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for existing developments that required an EIA, EIA screening or an AA but where such assessments were not carried out.<\/p> <p>In deciding \"exceptional circumstances\", the board must consider a number of matters prescribed at section 177D(2) of the planning Act, including whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the EIA directive or the habitats directive and whether the applicant could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised.<\/p> <p>There is currently no entitlement to make an application for substitute consent directly to the board.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eugene Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Substitute consent is generally a two-stage process requiring either a direction issued by a planning authority or grant of leave by the board to apply to the board for substitute consent at a first stage, followed by the making of a substantive application for substitute consent to the board at the second stage.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has dealt adequately with the amendments and the court judgments.  I will not continue on with that because it would only be repetition.  I join the previous two speakers and the Minster of State in saying we all wish for more houses to become available as quickly as possible.  It is in everybody's interest.  Even if we disagree on various aspects of the housing plan that is going forward, everybody's heart is in the right place and everybody wants us to have more housing available so that people can at least have a roof over their heads.  Many young people are saying that if we cannot do something about the housing situation, they do not have much of a future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#DDD00500","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome.  I also welcome the Bill.  It has been through pre-legislative scrutiny, which it is always important to point out.  I am going to go over the main conclusion from the pre-legislative scrutiny because I think it encapsulates everything, although I will find some other points to go through in my contribution.  The pre-legislative scrutiny concluded that these streamlining provisions are urgently required to ensure confidence in the Irish planning system by eliminating surplus steps in the substitute consent process to ensure it is efficient, fit for purpose and fully in compliance with EU environmental requirements and recent court judgments.  That is what pre-legislative scrutiny anticipated this Bill will do.<\/p> <p>It is important to consider the history of the situation.  From my own investigations, I understand the 2000 Act, as amended in 2010, which dealt with substitute consent, was an attempt to rectify deficiencies that were identified in 2006 by the European Court of Justice.  In 2020, in a case heard by the Supreme Court, it was found that part of the substitute consent was inconsistent with EU environmental law and, in particular, the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive.  That judgment is important.  The case was taken by An Taisce, which sometimes comes in for criticism but can lead to better outcomes, in that it has brought us to this point of amending our planning laws.  I will touch briefly on some of the amendments Senator Cummins has raised and that I am in favour of.  As I have said in the past, if we address issues, we will not need the same number of judicial reviews.  That is where we need to get to with all our planning laws.  We can reduce the level of judicial reviews through these efficiency measures.  This is exactly that kind of measure.  It shows we have the willingness to do that, as was encapsulated in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>I will point out two of the recommendations from the committee and ask the Minister of State where they stand.  The first recommendation is that regulations governing time limits for public consultation on substitute applications be extended from five to 12 weeks.  Having spoken to the Chair of the committee, my colleague Deputy Matthews, who is here and is welcome, I know that if the first stage of the process is eliminated, there may be an opportunity to extend consultation.  There may only be one stage but it would include full public participation, the lack of which was a key part of the criticism in the 2020 judgment of the Supreme Court.<\/p> <p>The second recommendation is that the Department provides for adequate staff and resources for planning and enforcement departments in local authorities.  We all agree on that point.  I ask the Minister of State to update us on that matter, which is important.<\/p> <p>Those are my main points.  I will come back in on Committee Stage.  It would be valuable if the Minister of State were to have a conversation with Senators and Deputy Matthews about the amendments and our views on them.  We are fundamentally in favour of the Bill.  It takes into consideration all of the environmental assessments that are required.  We came in for criticism in 2006 because planning retentions were widespread across Ireland, which we all remember.  We have moved beyond that but this Bill will move us even further.  It will bring us closer to proper environmental assessment, done efficiently, which can reduce the number of appeals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#EEE00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>A copy of the Minister of State's speech was not distributed.  Will the Minister of State remind me how many amendments he proposes to bring forward on Committee Stage?  I am wondering why they were not included in the Bill as drafted so we could debate those issues on Second Stage, as would normally be the case.<\/p><p>I read the briefing note that was drafted and circulated last week and the words &quot;unauthorised developments&quot; were used on two separate occasions.  I am sure I have heard those words in the course of this debate.  What we are talking about here are illegal developments.  These developments are breaking the law.  They do not have planning permission or consent under Irish or EU environmental law.  Because of the failure of previous governments to deal with the issue and because of their failure to legislate to create a process to deal with it, there are an enormous number of illegal developments in the State.  There are illegal quarries, illegal peat harvesting and illegal wind farms, such as the one at Derrybrien.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill because there continue to be far too many illegal developments.  We want to work with the Government to fix this issue.  These developments are not only in breach of planning law but are potentially causing significant destruction of the social, economic and environmental well-being of our communities.  It is not some minor issue.<\/p><p>I mentioned Derrybrien wind farm in south County Galway.  A piece in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on 8 February 2022 stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe peat slide in October 2003 during excavation work for the wind farm saw 450,000 tonnes of peat disturbed over an area of 25 hectares and resulted in the mass movement of 250,000 tonnes of material downslope.<br \/><br \/>Inland Fisheries Ireland told the appeals board that investigations after the peat slide indicated that about 50,000 fish died in an 18 km stretch of river down to Lough Cutra.<br \/><br \/>The State has already amassed fines of &euro;17 million as a result of an ongoing failure to ensure proper standards were adhered to at the Derrybrien development. <\/blockquote> <p>I understand this is the single biggest case of an illegal development in our history.  For 20 years, because of an illegal development, the social, environmental and economic well-being of this part of Galway has been devastated.  Because of an inadequacy on the part of the State and its Government, &euro;17 million worth of fines has been amassed.<\/p><p>In February, An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruled on the matter and refused substitute consent to the ESB subsidiary Gort Windfarms.  The wind farm should never have been built.  I am concerned that the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not state what should happen next.  Who is going to pay?  Who is going to clean up the mess?  Who will undo the environmental damage?  Who will compensate the local community?  The Bill is silent on all of those issues when it should have been the place to outline what happens next.  What is left for the people of Derrybrien who have had to endure 20 years of destruction?  Given what they have had to put up with and the scale of the fines the State has had to pay, it is important we get this legislation right.  We are supporting the Bill but we have genuine concerns I hope the Minister of State will address.  I hope we can resolve those concerns here in the Seanad or in the D&aacute;il at a later time.<\/p><p>The legislation is doing away with the application to leave stage.  Why are we doing away with that stage in the substitute consent process?  It is removing a significant step in the process and, therefore, I would like the reasoning to be explained in full.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am also concerned that we are allowing someone who has applied for substitute consent to simultaneously apply for permission for a new development.  Sinn F&eacute;in is of the view that the go-ahead for that new development is essentially rewarding somebody who has been breaking the law with a fast-track planning application.  It does not make any sense if somebody who has been breaking the law for a number of years gets this favour from applying for substitute consent and gets fast-tracked planning permission to do something else.  If someone who has been breaking planning law wants to apply for a new development, that should be done through the mainstream planning process.  There should be no access to a fast-tracked process for a new development rolled in with the substitute consent process.  Let us not reward bad behaviour in planning.<\/p><p>I am also surprised that there is no consideration in this Bill for the sub-threshold developments and that they have been excluded from the Bill.  I would like the Minister of State to explain that in his response.  Whether the original development would have automatically required an EIA or an EIA screening, both should have to be addressed in this Bill and it is a mistake that they are not.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's response to that.  Substitute consent should only be granted in exceptional circumstances and I am disappointed that the Government has not strengthened the exceptionality test.  My fear is that illegal developments will secure substitute consent even if there are no exceptional grounds involved.  Why did the Government not revise or strengthen the existing exceptionality test and amend that legislation?  In this Bill that has been removed or transposed from the old legislation.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to outline to the House exactly what he is doing about public consultation.  The better the public consultation process, the better the outcomes for everyone.  What level of access will the public have to information, consultation and documentation?  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the legislation is fully consistent with the Aarhus Convention?  Has the Attorney General been consulted to ensure that the provisions of this Bill are consistent with our legal responsibilities under the Aarhus Convention?  A series of quarry-specific amendments to this Bill have been introduced but they were not in the general scheme.  Why has the Government done this and what are the full implications of those changes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#EEE00300","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Is it possible to get a copy of the Minister of State's speech circulated?  There seem to be a specific number of amendments coming in and as Senator Warfield says they have not been addressed.  We do not want to see a situation - although this would not be overly problematic - like when the whole forestry section was dropped into the fur farming Bill two weeks ago.  It is not a good way to do legislation and it would be good for us to have a chance to look at that.  We will work with the Minister of State on this but it is fair that we get information on what amendments are going in.<\/p> <p>This Bill is intending to amend the 2000 Act to provide for a single stage application process.  I want to focus my comments on some of the amendments we might propose on Second Stage, particularly around the area of public participation in our planning process and where that planning relates to quarries.  Quarries have significant environmental impacts and we know about that from the Derrynane judgment.  Through the SHD system and the housing process we have seen that SHDs undermined people's faith in the planning process and made them believe they had no say in it.  Then the planning process got clogged up within the courts system.  Public participation, as difficult as it can be for some people, is not something to be undermined, particularly when it relates to environmental impact surveys.  Instead of facilitating the two-stage application process with public participation at both stages or even a robust pre-consultation process, the Government has reduced it to a one-stage process in this Bill.  For something as important as substitute consent or retention permission that has such environmental impacts it is important that we have robust public participation.  That is not to say that public participation should stop or slow up things, but if people are brought along on a process a much better system often emerges at the end.<\/p> <p>My final point relates to what the Bill deems to be \"exceptional circumstances\".  This should be considered at more than one stage of the process when such a significant environmental impact on communities is at stake.  That is where we will be focusing our amendments.  We ask the Minister to circulate a copy of his speech so we can get a clearer idea of what will be changed and amended on Committee Stage.  I would hope the changes will not be so significant that we do not have the opportunity to raise them here and propose amendments on Committee Stage, which will lead on to Report Stage.  I ask that we could possibly come back and do it again if that was the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022040600002#FFF00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1649235000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for engaging in the debate.  We will have my speech circulated.  I understood that it had been but we will rectify that forthwith.<\/p> <p>I thank everyone for their contributions on the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022 and for facilitating its swift passage through the House.  As I mentioned in my opening speech, the purpose of the Bill is to amend the substitute consent process which concerns retrospective EIA or AA in exceptional circumstances by removing the initial leave-to-apply stage, an initial stage which did not involve public participation.  Related provisions clarify that an EIA and AA screening for planning authorities is also included.  The Bill also proposes that an existing provision which is presently solely available to quarry projects to allow a simultaneous application for future development at the same time as a substitute consent application should be expanded to include all development types.  This is to encourage remediation of existing unauthorised developments.  However, as with the existing quarry provisions, if the substitute consent application is refused the future planning application must also be refused.<\/p> <p>In the context of the wider planning system, substitute consent applications make up a small and statistically insignificant percentage of the overall number of planning applications.  This does not recognise the important of the substitute consent process in bringing certain unauthorised developments back into the planning process where they can be subject to the appropriate environmental oversight and regulation.<\/p> <p>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I will reference a few points.  As I detailed in my opening contribution, we will deal with the extension of the public consultation period by way of secondary regulations in context of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  They will commence in tandem with this Bill, as I also referenced.<\/p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised local authority workforce planning, which is ongoing.  We are resourcing additional capacity in our local authorities.

We are bringing these to the House as a matter of courtesy to inform Senators.  They will have to get Government approval to go forward on Committee Stage.  We are flagging them with Senators and bringing robust scrutiny to them.  They are technical in nature and recommended by the Attorney General.  Some of them are time-bound, like the affordable housing amendment.  We need to move forward at pace with that.<\/p> <p>On quarries, we are treating everything the same way, as I referenced earlier.  I also gave the rationale for trying to bring projects that might be unauthorised into the full regulation of the State with regard to environment matters, which is important.
