This original timeline has been impacted by a number of factors. <\/p>  <p>  PLUTO is underpinned by an extensive evidence base comprising of 13 background papers carried out by officials in my Department. These papers consider a wide range of issues such as climate change, Brexit, technology, steady state maintenance, compact growth, rural accessibility, interurban connectivity and international connectivity. Undertaking and finalising this volume of analysis underpinning PLUTO, including associated review and engagement with the Steering Group, has taken longer than originally anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  To help guide future transport investment to support the delivery of Project Ireland 2040, a particular focus of PLUTO has been identifying potential constraints on the future land transport network. Using the transport models held by the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, this has involved scenario analysis based on National Planning Framework population projections and National Development Plan investment. Ensuring these scenarios were appropriately specified and provided robust evidence for PLUTO took considerable time. <\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Research and Analysis Division within my Department which is leading the development of PLUTO experienced some staff turnover and held a number of vacancies in the latter half of 2018 and into 2019.

Those increased services have been supported through increased PSO subvention which between 2016 and 2018 rose by 9% (including Local Link), as well as increased capital investment.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of bus, the Deputy is aware that the PSO fleet has increased in recent years with additional buses being added to existing fleets, as well as constant replacement of older, dirtier buses with newer, cleaner buses. That expanded bus fleet has supported expanded bus services with a 7% increase in annual operated vehicle kilometres across both Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Bus &Eacute;ireann over the period 2016 to 2018 for example.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to rail, increased services such as the 10-minute DART and expanded usage of the Phoenix Park Tunnel have facilitated increasing patronage, but I recognise that there are particular capacity pressures now being experienced on the rail network, and in particular on the Greater Dublin Area commuter network which carries approximately 70% of all journeys. In the summer I secured Government&rsquo;s approval for a new National Train Control Centre which will improve the overall management of the network, while more recently Government approved the expansion of the Intercity Railcar fleet through the purchase of 41 additional carriages, which will boost capacity by around 34% across the Maynooth, Kildare and Northern Lines.

This review will consider, inter alia, if any further changes can be introduced to expedite the assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to successful applicants,\u00a0\u00a0all grantees are informed\u00a0at the time of allocation that they need to make progress in the drawdown of their grant or risk having it withdrawn. It can often take applicants\u00a0a number of years to fully draw down their grants however, due to issues around\u00a0legal requirements, delays in the planning process or delays with contractors. Given these genuine reasons for delays in drawing down grants I do not propose to make any changes to the requirements on applicants drawing down grants within a set timeframe at this stage.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100052#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licence Data","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100052#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[47910\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100052#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the percentage of disqualified drivers' driving licences returned to the PO box address of the Road Safety Authority in 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>In\u00a02018, 9,824 drivers received court\u00a0disqualifications, of which\u00a01,052 driving licences were surrendered.

In addition, a further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, I cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied. <\/p><p>That said, my predecessor Minister Noonan recognised that the environment within which insurers operate could be improved and consequently established the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) in 2016, which was chaired initially by then Minister of State for Financial Services, Eoghan Murphy TD.  Its purpose was to examine the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  I believe that the CIWG has made a lot of progress and it is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of both of its reports.  This progress is reflected in the fact that CSO figures show motor insurance costs have decreased by 27.1% since the peak in July 2016. <\/p><p>Much works remain to be done and in this regard the implementation of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) benchmarking report is critical, if we are to bring award levels more into line with other jurisdictions, and thus reduce the cost of insurance and increase its availability. As the Deputy is aware the groundwork for this has been laid through the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill and once operational it will be a matter for the Judiciary to put in place new guidelines which reflect amongst other things the PIC report. <\/p><p>In addition, I think it is worth noting that the Minister of State&rsquo;s title includes special responsibility for Financial Services and Insurance.  When An Taoiseach announced his decision to appoint Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy to this new portfolio in June 2017, I believe that the specific reference to insurance in his portfolio demonstrated the Government&rsquo;s belief that this issue needed to be tackled by a dedicated Minister of State within the Department of Finance.  In that respect, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has taken a lead role in relation to chairing the CIWG, and as part of that role, he has held numerous meetings with relevant stakeholders, including the insurance industry and its representatives.  I believe that this has been appropriate and remains so, in light of the Minister of State&rsquo;s responsibilities.  However, I wish to emphasise that I, as the Minister for Finance, have and will continue to play an active role in ensuring that insurance reform remains a priority for the Government.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I do not believe that a measure of success for any Minister for Finance is the number of meetings held with any individual sector, instead it is the progress being made towards a stated objective, in this case lower insurance costs.  While accepting that much work remains to be done, I believe strongly that tangible results have been delivered on the insurance reform front to date. In addition, the necessary framework to enable the recalibration of personal injury award levels will soon be in place and I would expect this to have a significant impact on the cost and availability of insurance.  <\/p><p>I am happy to provide the information requested and would refer the Deputy to the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Meetings (Minister Noonan) <\/th>       <th>Date <\/th>       <th>Location <\/th>       <th>Purpose <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kevin Hogan, Chief Executive Officer, Consumer Insurance, AIGSid Sankaran, Chief Financial officer, AIGDeclan O&rsquo;Rourke, Country Manager for Ireland, AIG<\/td>       <td>1\/12\/2016<\/td>       <td>Department of Finance<\/td>       <td>Meeting with AIG following request by IDA<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meetings (Minister Donohoe) <\/td>       <td>Date <\/td>       <td>Location <\/td>       <td>Purpose <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kevin Thompson, CEO (Insurance Ireland)Declan Jackson, Director of Government Affairs (Insurance Ireland)Aidan Holton, International Council Chair (Insurance Ireland) and CEO (SCOR Global) <\/td>       <td>28\/03\/2018 <\/td>       <td>Department of Finance <\/td>       <td>Discussion &ndash; Implications of US tax reforms <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100053#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Powers","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100053#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[48355\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100053#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the additional detection and support facilities made available to the Revenue Commissioners in view of the increased detection of illegal drugs being sent through the postal services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a number of additional staff and increased use of the Revenue drug detector dog teams including a new drug detector dog, have been deployed in the mail centres.

The definition of first time buyer in HTB is as follows:<\/p><p><i>'first-time purchaser' means an individual who, at the time of a claim under subsection (3) has not, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling; <\/i><\/p><p>The intention is to target the Help to Buy scheme on those who have not had the opportunity to build up equity in another property which could be used to purchase the second or subsequent property. <\/p><p>The definition complements that in the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.

(Also where the borrower under a housing loan is more than one person and one or more of those persons has previously been advanced a housing loan, none of those persons is a first-time buyer for the purposes of the lending rules). However, the Central Bank also advises me that it introduced proportionate limits in it mortgage lending framework specifically to allow flexibility by lenders when assessing individual cases, such as may be the case for separated or divorced persons.

The existing distribution of financial processing across Public Service Bodies (PSBs) and systems does not support the automated consolidation of data at a central level. The continued use of legacy systems could not meet existing and emerging requirements without considerable duplication of effort and at a potentially significant cost\/risk to the State.<\/p><p>The implementation of the single FMS, aligned with the standardisation of processes across central government, will provide the necessary supporting framework, and is an essential enabler, for the financial reporting reform outlined in the 2019 OECD Report on &quot;Financial Reporting in Ireland&quot;. A single best-in-class finance technology platform will provide greater flexibility and strategic capability to respond to new and emerging requirements in a more consistent, agile and cost effective manner, while future proofing the Government&rsquo;s Finance Function. It will also provide significantly improved financial information and data insights, on a real time accruals basis, which will strengthen informed decision making across PSBs and Central Government. <\/p><p>The original business case anticipated that the Programme would return cost savings of some &euro;15.4m per annum once fully operational. <\/p><p>In addition to the projected operational cost savings, it is also important to consider that the programme negates the costs of upgrading the existing 31 legacy systems which would be significant (benchmark estimates suggest a range of &euro;50m-&euro;80m), and would not deliver the reporting reforms or rich source of centralised data available from this single FMS programme.<\/p><p>With respect to timelines, a decision was made in mid-2018 to pause entry into user acceptance testing and review the design of the technology platform.<\/p><p>I<b><\/b>am informed by the National Shared Services Office (NSSO) that the design review of the new financial management technology platform was completed recently. This has highlighted a number of process and technical opportunities for improvement of the single finance platform for Government.  This will ensure that the quality of the solution implemented will support the reform of public finance management and reporting. Changes are not unusual in a programme of this scale and complexity that will replace and upgrade 31 existing different systems with one new finance system for Government. <\/p><p>As a result of the design review, and the work to realise the improvements identified by the review, the project will not be completed by 2021 as originally planned.  This is a large scale complex programme that will take longer than originally anticipated to deliver the new system for 48 Public Service Bodies over a number of years. The timeline will be worked through in consultation with the system implementation partner and each Public Service Body.<\/p><p>The original Business Case recognised the level of complexity in this Programme and envisaged that the costs to support a full deployment, taking account of potential delays that were liable to arise for a system of this complexity, could range from &euro;47.4m to &euro;62.25m excluding VAT. The total amount spent to date on the project is &euro;36.5m excluding VAT. <\/p><p>A project of this scale and complexity requires a wide range of skills and expertise from within and outside the Civil Service. I am informed by the NSSO of the following spending on consultants, recruited to provide advice on the development of the project to date: <table>    <tr>       <th>Consultant<\/th>       <th>Spend to date (ex VAT)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>EY<\/td>       <td>&euro;814,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Deloitte<\/td>       <td>&euro;4,461,000<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>I am informed that EY was engaged by the NSSO to provide expert advice on programme governance.

This will provide increased choices for students, an enhanced student experience and greater access for potential students tackling educational disadvantage with TUs offering a broad range of teaching from apprenticeship to doctoral degrees. They will also support an increased intensity of research activity which will provide increased opportunities for collaboration with industry and deliver benefits for the economy and wider society. TUs will marry both an attractive physical multi-campus presence with state-of-the-art digital connectivity, providing new modes of learning where the student and learner is placed centre-stage and can access course content and avail of first-class tuition irrespective of location or circumstance. Each TU will serve as an anchor institution in the development and advancement of its region. Drawing frontier technological developments to regions through intensive collaboration, engagement with and connectedness to national and international researchers will be fundamental to TUs acting as regional knowledge hubs. These hubs will, in turn, act as major catalysts for further direct investment, research, innovation and employment growth.<\/p>  <p>  On 18 October I announced &euro;14.25 million in funding to Higher Education Institutions under the HEA 2019 call for submissions for higher education landscape restructuring, consolidation and collaborative projects. The majority of this investment, &euro;11.8 million, is aimed at progressing the creation and expansion of TUs. The Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA), comprising the Galway Mayo, Letterkenny and Sligo Institutes of Technology, was allocated &euro;2 million under this call bringing total Exchequer funding to date for their project to &euro;5.92 million. In total since 2013 some &euro;31 million in Exchequer funding has been invested in TU creation and development.<\/p>  <p>  Launched earlier this month, the report of the high level working group, the TU Research Network (TURN), entitled &lsquo;Technological Universities: Connectedness &amp;amp; Collaboration enabled by Connectivity&rsquo; sets out the case for a state change in higher education reform for the delivery of national strategic priorities such as are elaborated in Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland. This state change is to be achieved through the connectedness, particularly at regional level, collaboration and connectivity of TUs and their unique delivery of programmes across the full range of the National Framework of Qualifications. The report makes a series of 12 recommendations for outcomes that will provide TUs with a solid foundation for their development. These centre upon three thematic areas identified by TURN as the essential building blocks for successful TUs\u00a0: -\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  -  investment in integrated multi-campus digital\u00a0infrastructure to provide regional cohesion and to facilitate new modes of\u00a0learning and the prioritisation of capital investment in TUs; <\/p>  <p>  -  investment in research capacity building by\u00a0developing researcher human capital, facilitating research activity and opportunities\u00a0for existing academic staff and implementing a researcher career\u00a0development and employment framework, addressing infrastructural deficits\u00a0and prioritising research strategies within TUs, exploiting fully the\u00a0mutually supporting roles of teaching and research; and<\/p>  <p>  -  re-alignment of the policy framework and funding\u00a0for TUs including an expansion of institutional autonomy and reform\u00a0through the implementation of TU-apposite career structures, the reform of\u00a0the grant allocation model to accommodate TUs, the creation of a dedicated\u00a0TU funding stream including in the post-establishment phase and the creation of a borrowing framework for TUs. <\/p>  <p>  The report recognises that relevant priority actions can only be achieved through a structured, system-wide, relevant and dynamic process that will ensure value for money, underpinned by a robust and evidence-based set of monitoring and evaluation arrangements.\u00a0The TURN report can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As announced during Budget 2020 and in response to the TURN report the Government is providing &euro;90 million over the next three years under a new TU Transformation Fund to support consortia such as CUA to achieve TU designation and to support the further advancement of established TUs. <\/p>  <p>  The TURN report and the ongoing work of the group, whose remit\u00a0is being extended, will continue to be of considerable assistance and benefit to consortia such as the CUA towards achieving\u00a0TU designation, as will access to the new TU Transformation Fund being developed currently in consultation with TURN.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As such further TU creation, establishment and progression will be achieved by the relevant stakeholders delivering on the TURN report recommendations and the transformational multi-annual funding underpinning such delivery. <\/p>  <p>  The Department met with the Presidents and Chairs of the IoTs involved in the CUA in recent weeks in relation to TU related system-wide issues and to support and encourage the consortium in the progression of their TU development proposals. However, ultimately it remains a matter for a consortium to lead on the progression of their plans to seek TU designation under the Technological Universities Act 2018 and to ensure that they have a shared unitary vision and purpose for TU development and can demonstrate compliance with the relevant eligibility criteria and related legislative requirements prescribed in the 2018 Act.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In this context it is understood from the recent discussion that an application by the consortium is anticipated to be made by CUA in the latter half of 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100054#WRD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100055#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[48471\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100055#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status and proposed timeline for funding of the construction of a new school building at a school (details supplied) in County Sligo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>The delivery of a building project at the school referred to by the Deputy has been devolved to the school authority.

This new operating model has been implemented in the Department to create a better platform for the professional delivery of services. <\/p>  <p>  My Department's work was previously structured by subject areas relating to different parts of the Justice and Equality sector. Cosc - The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence was an example of this.  By contrast, the Department is now divided into two pillars- Criminal Justice and Civil Justice and Equality. Within these pillars, the Department is divided into structured into four functional areas:  Policy development, Governance, Legislation, Operations &amp;amp; Service Delivery.  Support is provided across the pillars by Corporate and Transparency.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the work previously carried out by Cosc, the reorganised Department model means that specialist teams will now focus on specific functions relating to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The work that was carried out by Cosc will be distributed under the new model in the following way: <\/p>  <p>  Policy Function (Community Safety) will take over many of the responsibilities Cosc previously held. This Division will be the contact point for NGOs for issues such as the monitoring and implementation of the second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence. This Division will be engaged with the development of Policy to determine requirements and challenges facing the domestic, sexual and gender based violence sector. <\/p>  <p>  Governance Function will be responsible for overseeing the actions of criminal justice agencies in implementing the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation Function will be responsible for actions such as any proposed amendments to the Domestic Violence Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Operations and Service Delivery Function will make decisions on funding, through a centralised Funding Administration team, to support best practice and centralised oversight of NGO funding.<\/p>  <p>  Transparency will be responsible for actions such as the national awareness raising campaign under the second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has had a number of meetings with NGOs who work in the area, bilaterally and in larger groups, to discuss the Transformation programme.

For the purposes of Irish law, the mother of a child is the person who gives birth to the child or a female adopter of the child. In general, the father is the person identified as the genetic father of the child or a male adopter.<\/p>  <p>  Section 7, of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended addresses citizenship by descent and provides that a person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen. However, an additional requirement of registration is imposed in respect of children born outside the State of Ireland where the Irish citizen parent was also born outside the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and specifically the passport service, is tasked with processing passport applications in line with the requirements of the Passports Act 2008. The Passport Act 2008, sets out the legislative framework within which the passport service processes all applications for passports. Pursuant to section 7 of the Passport Act 2008, a passport cannot be issued unless the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is satisfied the person is an Irish citizen and is also satisfied as to the identity of the person. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, under the current Irish law, Section 7, of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 does not apply, where the Irish citizen is neither the birth mother nor the genetic father or neither the male nor female adopter of the child. Consequently, the child does not qualify for Irish citizenship by descent and therefore does not qualify for the granting of an Irish passport.<\/p>  <p>  I am\u00a0informed that Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which provide for parentage of children born through donor-assisted human reproduction, will come into operation on 4 May 2020, as provided for by the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Parts 2 and 3) (Commencement) Order 2019 (S.I. No. 541 of 2019) recently made by the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child is born in the State through donor-assisted human reproduction prior to the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, depending on the particular circumstances, it may be possible after Parts 2 and 3 come into operation for a couple to seek a declaration under section 21 of the Act that the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the birth mother is the other parent of the child (with all of the parental responsibilities that entails), and ultimately to have a new birth certificate issued reflecting that legal parentage.\u00a0 However, it is important to note that Parts 2 and 3 of the Act will only apply to children born in the State.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the evolving situation relating to recognition of domestic births, and noting the very complex legal matters involved, I have asked my officials to consult with colleagues in other relevant Departments with the view to seeking an appropriate solution in relation to births that take place abroad. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100055#WRE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[48387\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100055#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when legislation will be brought forward to resolve the High Court ruling that placed a ban on all travel for applicants for citizenship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[48388\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100055#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps being taken to expedite citizenship applications in view of the excessive delays faced by applicants.","asker":"1302","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that I obtained Government approval to introduce legislation if required and depending on the outcome of an appeal to the Court of Appeal.\u00a0 The Court handed down its decision on Thursday, 14 November and, while my officials and I\u00a0will need to study the judgement in its entirety over the coming days,\u00a0I very much welcome the decision of the Court with regard to citizenship applications. <\/p>  <p>  I know that the past few months have\u00a0been quite stressful for applicants, their families and their friends .\u00a0 I am\u00a0satisfied however, that the Court has provided legal clarity, and the decision has upheld the lawfulness of our residency rules governing citizenship through naturalisation.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The processing of applications continued throughout the period in which the appeal decision was awaited.

In Ireland's case, this is an increase on 44% in 2016.<\/p><p>28% of Ireland's population meanwhile have above basic digital skills, a figure that also refers to 2017, and which compares to an EU average of 31%.

Technological advances and the transition to the low carbon economy present challenges but also numerous opportunities as our businesses and workers learn to operate in a changed economy. <\/p><p>In addition to support from Government to exploit these opportunities, investment by enterprises to innovate is required and our people will also need to learn new skills. The enhancement of digital skills will be core to the vision set out in <i>Future Jobs Ireland<\/i>, which includes efforts to embrace innovation and technological change and the improvement of SME productivity.<\/p><p>One of the key targets set out in <i>Future Jobs Ireland <\/i>is to increase the share of the population with basic or above basic digital skills from its 2017 baseline of 48%, to equal or greater than the EU average by 2025. This is complemented by an ambition to double Ireland's lifelong learning rate from a 2017 baseline of 8.9% to 18% by 2025.<\/p><p>The means by which these targets will be realised are set out under pillar 3 of <i>Future Jobs<\/i>, on enhancing skills and developing and attracting talent- the majority of these initiatives will be progressed by the Department of Education and Skills and its agencies. <\/p><p>These include the development of digital literacy curricula at school level, the implementation of Upskilling Pathways- New Opportunities for Adults, the Skills to Advance and EXPLORE upskilling programmes for lower skilled workers, the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship offerings, Springboard+ courses in new technologies, Skillnet Ireland training provision in digital skills development and emerging technologies, and the roll out of the new Human Capital Initiative within the Higher Education sector.<\/p><p>These initiatives are in turn being supported through reforms to the National Training Fund, to align it more directly with the changing skills requirements of the Irish labour force. <\/p><p>Other commitments in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 complement these initiatives and recognise the role that employers have in supporting the upskilling of employees. Future Jobs Ireland 2020 will build on these commitments and introduce additional actions which will result in further progress in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Transfers","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF02500"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[48278\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be transferred; the reason for the delay in same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF02800"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[48283\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the development of inpatient capacity for mental health services within the Waterford and Wexford LHO; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Recruitment","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF03100"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[48293\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a position will be sanctioned in the case of a person (detail supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[48304\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100056#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of times he has met with insurance companies and Insurance Ireland since 1 January 2016; the date of each meeting; the persons or bodies he met with; the purpose of each meeting in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>As Minister for Health I have oversight and governance responsibilities in relation to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, the statutory board which does business as Vhi Healthcare.

However, following the Government decision in 2012 to locate the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the St James&rsquo;s campus, it was necessary to revisit the earlier decisions regarding the relocation of both the Rotunda and the Coombe Women and Infants University hospitals.  <\/p>  <p>  A detailed review was undertaken by my Department, which considered a number of potential host sites for both hospitals, examining demographics, a range of clinical criteria as well as planning risks and site capacity.

A revised and evaluated proposal is awaited from the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  While the Minister recognises that some infrastructural development will be necessary at the Rotunda Hospital in the interim period, as Deputies will be aware, in line with Government policy to co-locate maternity services with acute adult services, the Rotunda Hospital will be relocated to Connolly Hospital.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. As of October 2019, there have been 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines approved for reimbursement in the public healthcare system.  The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.Application 2 is for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\/Cannabidiol, THC\/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 25 September 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 November 2019, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product siponimod (Mayzent), intended for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease. The EMA's decision on whether to grant marketing authorisation for siponimod will take into account CHMP's recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner. My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. <\/p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund Data","counter":438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":439,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[48457\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the breakdown on the year-to-date distribution of the 2019 &euro;75 million budget of the NTPF amongst each private and public hospital benefitting from same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":440,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[48458\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amounts paid to individual public hospitals receiving NTPF and other HSE funding for the purposes of insourcing and outsourcing of surgical procedures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[48459\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number and types of surgical procedures and treatments carried out to date in 2019 by each public and private hospital under the NTPF scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 159, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is currently being collated by officials in my Department and will be provided to the Deputy directly as soon as it becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH01200"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[48472\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider the lack of pump services available for adults with type 1 diabetes in Sligo University Hospital (details supplied); his plans to address same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Action Plans","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH01500"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[48479\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider the recent figures of the rising number of persons that are waiting on trolleys in Sligo University Hospital; his plans to introduce more beds at the hospital in the short term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>I wish to acknowledge the distress overcrowded EDs cause to patients, their families and frontline staff working in very challenging working conditions in hospitals throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  According to HSE TrolleyGAR data, there was a 3.2% increase in patients counted waiting on trolleys at 8am in Sligo University Hospital ED this year up to the end of October 2019 compared to the same period last year.

The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. <\/p>  <p>  One important element is the new delivery model, which originally required Member States to submit their draft CAP Strategic Plan covering Pillar I and Pillar II expenditure to the Commission for approval before 1 January 2020. However, given the typically challenging nature of the discussions on the CAP and the EU Budget post-2020, there has been a delay in adopting these proposals. <\/p>  <p>  As a result, the European Commission has recently published its proposals for transitional measures to allow for continuity between programming periods of 2014-2020 and 2021-2027 for CAP payments. The draft proposals provide for an additional, transitional year before starting the new CAP, which would require Member States to submit their draft CAP Strategic Plans to the Commission for approval by 1 January 2021. The proposals will be discussed by Member States over the coming months, and my officials are currently assessing their content.  <\/p>  <p>  I am open to working with the new delivery model and welcome the move to a more strategic, performance-based approach.  However, this new framework must be based on a system which provides simplification for all.   <\/p>  <p>  The development of the draft CAP Strategic Plan will be a complex process, involving a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis, a needs assessment, scheme design, an ex-ante evaluation including a Strategic Environmental Assessment, and an Appropriate Assessment. <\/p>  <p>  A key element of the development of the Plan is regular stakeholder and public consultation.  My Department has held a series of external stakeholder events, public consultations and public meetings since January 2018.  In addition, in May 2019, I established a national CAP Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which meets regularly as the CAP negotiations evolve. In September, I launched a public consultation on the SWOT analysis, and as part of this process, my Department hosted a series of &lsquo;townhall&rsquo; events in Mitchelstown, Sligo and Portlaoise, as well as a stakeholder workshop in Tullamore. The next stage of formal consultation is under consideration and its timing will be related to the progress of the discussions on the proposals.  <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders and interest groups through existing forums and structures to update them on the progress of discussions and to hear their views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH05400"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[48288\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100058#WRH05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department carried out an analysis on the new green architecture as set out in the new European Commission CAP proposals published in June 2018; and his views on this architecture and the new eco scheme proposed.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>The European Commission's proposals for the post-2020 CAP commit to a more significant environmental ambition than the current CAP schemes.  It is proposed that EU payments will be subject to a common baseline of conditionality with a number of requirements for good agriculture and environmental conditions for land.  In Pillar I, an eco scheme, which would be mandatory for Member States to offer, but voluntary for farmers, is provided for.  I support the provision of eco schemes.  However, at this stage, it is too early to say how such a scheme, or other environmental schemes, might be configured. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission proposals require 40% of the total CAP budget, at EU level, to be dedicated to environmental and climate actions.  Member States must ensure that 30% of Pillar II funding - excluding funding for Areas of Natural Constraint - will be devoted to the environment and climate change.  <\/p>  <p>  I firmly support the principle that there must be a high level of environmental ambition in the CAP post-2020. I believe that the economic development of the agri-food sector goes hand-in-hand with the need for environmental sustainability.  However, it is essential that the proposed new environmental conditionality is implemented effectively, with common standards that are relevant and effective. It is also important that the overall level of the budget acknowledges the public goods being delivered by farmers. <\/p>  <p>  My key priority remains to continue to press for agreement on the CAP reform proposals and on the maintenance of the CAP budget as part of the EU Multiannual Financial Framework for the post-2020 period.

The main document is the <i>Forestry Standards Manual<\/i>.  This manual complements, and should be read in conjunction with, <i>Land Types for Afforestation<\/i>, <i>Environmental Requirements for Afforestation<\/i>, <i>Irish National Forest Standard<\/i>, the <i>Code of Best Forest Practice &ndash; Ireland, Standards for Felling and Reforestation<\/i>and other guidance published by my Department.  <\/p><p><i>Required Documentation<\/i><\/p><p>Certain documentation, depending on the licence required, must be submitted with the application.  An application form, site location map, certified species map and biodiversity maps are <i>inter alia<\/i>required for afforestation.  Other documents will be required, registered foresters will be familiar with the requirements for the application.<\/p><p><i>Procedures<\/i><\/p><p>The application is submitted, and administrative officials will check to ensure it is complete.  The application will be advertised on my Department&rsquo;s website and submissions from interested parties invited.  At the same time, it is forwarded to a Forestry District Inspector and where required, the application is referred to certain prescribed bodies.  The prescribed bodies include statutory consultees such as the local authority, National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), Inland Fisheries Ireland and\/or An Taisce.  30 days is provided for public consultation and no decision may issue before that time.  Where NPWS is consulted, that time is extended to a minimum of eight weeks. <\/p><p>If built heritage or archaeological monuments are recorded or found within or proximate to a proposed site, the application will be referred to my Department&rsquo;s Archaeologists so that the site can be assessed in conjunction with the National Monuments Service.  <\/p><p>Upon receiving the application, the District Inspector may decide that further information such as revised maps, submission of a Natura Impact Assessment, hydrological report or a soil report is required.  The applicant and their registered forester will be advised by letter of what information is being sought.<\/p><p>The District Inspector will desk assess the application and may carry out a field assessment where risk analysis selects the application or where the inspector&rsquo;s own knowledge will deem a field inspection necessary.  All forestry licence applications undergo Appropriate Assessment (AA) screening.  <\/p><p>I  acknowledge that changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP) has resulted in delays to many files.  These are beyond my Department&rsquo;s control as we are obliged to implement changes to AAP that were required following important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee and others. <\/p><p>Currently, we are amending the AA procedure in order to introduce a robust and workable system which will address the issues now faced.  Introducing this system involves the recruitment of additional ecological expertise and changes in procedures for the forestry inspectorate.  My Department recently advertised for additional ecologists and we also have access to external ecological support, which will be supplemented in due course.  Inspectors have already undergone training and will receive appropriate support in delivering these new procedures.  A categorisation of files affected by these requirements is also underway in order to best assess further action needed and by whom.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that this has led to a temporary disruption in issuing afforestation licences, the Deputy should be aware that the sector has approximately 3,200 hectares of approvals issued this year which are shovel-ready and yet to be planted.  <\/p><p>If the site is greater than 50ha, or 2km for a forest road, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be required.  This will enable an Environmental Impact Assessment to be carried out.  Where an application is less than these areas\/lengths, that is sub-threshold, an EIS may also be required.  This will be in situations where the proposed development is likely to have a significant environmental impact.<\/p><p>When the inspector is satisfied with the assessment of the application, recommendations will be provided.  These recommendations will form part of the decision on the application, which will be issued to the applicant and their registered forester.  The decision will also issue to any individual who made a submission on the application.  The decision provides for 28 days in which to make an appeal, to the independent Forestry Appeals Committee.  During that time, no forestry operations may take place.<\/p><p><i>Other Considerations<\/i><\/p><p>Apart from possible environmental impacts, the application will be assessed against other criteria, such as silvicultural requirements, the social impacts of the application and the local landscape.

As a State intervention, the NBP must comply with the requirements scheduling of the European Commission&rsquo;s Guidelines on the application of State aid rules for broadband networks. The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention D&aacute;il business is required. <\/p>  <p>  Since July 2013, the Department has engaged in an extensive process of mapping broadband availability in Ireland in order to identify premises requiring State intervention. The mapping exercise has been supported by a number of public consultations which have elicited significant response from industry and the public. The most significant changes to the NBP Map took place in 2017. The Department added a further 84,500 premises to the Intervention Area where commercial investment plans previously provided to the Department had failed to materialise. The update also removed 300,000 premises from the intervention area on the basis of what was then a planned infrastructure build, that eir entered into a Commitment Agreement in respect of. <\/p>  <p>  Having consulted with industry on an ongoing basis, my Department recently conducted a final public consultation to close the mapping exercise in advance of the award of the NBP contract. Over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public. <\/p>  <p>  Following evaluation of the submissions and receipt of a positive State aid decision on 15 November, responses have been issued to the submissions from the commercial operators. Having evaluated the submissions received, approximately 38,000 premises were removed from the intervention area as commercial operators provided evidence that these premises can now access a high speed broadband service from an existing network. These premises relate to network deployment detailed in submissions received from eir and SIRO, that were evaluated as meeting the assessment criteria published by the Department. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 37,000 premises originally identified as being served by commercial operators have now been included in the intervention area matter for the NBP, as commercial operators plans to serve these premises have not materialised. The map has also been updated for approximately an additional 2,000 premises identified in the latest Ordinance Survey Ireland data. The final Intervention Area now covers 537,596 premises.<\/p>  <p>  The NBP contract, which was signed on 18 November, provides that the future proofed high speed broadband network to be deployed by National Broadband Ireland will also pass and connect new premises built in the intervention area over the next 25 years. While a download speed threshold of 30Mbps applied in the mapping process as a requirement, the tender submitted by National Broadband Ireland committed to a network that will initially provide services of 150Mbps to the majority of homes and up to 1Gbps to heavy data users and Small and Medium size Enterprises. There will be an upgrade pathway for the 150Mbps broadband product for consumers to 300Mbps by year 6 of the rollout and to 500Mbps by year 10. The 1Gbps product for businesses will also upgrade to 2Gbps by year 11. <\/p>  <p>  These commitments are reflected in the NBP contract and will ensure that people living and working in rural areas, will have access to a similar quality of broadband service to people living and working in urban areas. The maximum possible investment by the State under the National Broadband Plan is capped at &euro;2.977 billion over 25 years. This includes &euro;480m for contingency costs and &euro;354m in VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100059#WRJ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Licence Fee","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100059#WRJ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[48344\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100059#WRJ04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on the future of the television licence fee system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Working Group on the Future Funding of Public Service Broadcasting that the TV licence be put out to public tender.

These actions include developing the charging network to stay sufficiently ahead of demand.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 96 fast chargers (the majority of which are operated by the ESB) in Ireland.

This project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers consisting of 90 150kW chargers (each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously) and upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to 50kW chargers The project will also involve replacing over 500 existing standard charge points with next generation high reliability models. <\/p>  <p>  This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.

In <i>Project Ireland 2040<\/i>, the government has indicatively allocated &euro;8.6 billion over the period 2018 to 2027 towards the delivery of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system. Furthermore, I have made clear my intent, and that of the Government, to drive the transition from fossil-fuelled vehicles towards greener fuels and technologies. <\/p><p>While the public transport network, including buses, taxis and trains accounts for only a little over 4% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall transport emissions, moving to low-emission alternatives for public transport is important in order to promote and normalise the use of lower emitting fuels and technologies. Such technologies offer significant benefits in reducing carbon and other harmful air pollutant emissions, and also play a strong leadership role in addressing the effects of climate change.<\/p><p>A Green Public Transport Fund operates at a national level to support the piloting and uptake of energy-efficient and alternatively-fuelled technologies for Public Service Obligation (PSO) operations within the bus fleet and the Small Public Service Vehicles (SPSV) sector. It also helps vehicle purchasers to bridge the price differential between such technologies and conventionally-fuelled vehicles.  <\/p><p>Under the Fund, I established the national Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme in 2018, as part of a range of other incentives to support electric vehicles. The SPSVs supported under the scheme include taxis, hackneys and limousines. The scheme currently provides grants of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. <\/p><p>This initiative has resulted in the registration of 70 electric SPSVs to date. I understand that, to date, one such grant was issued to an SPSV driver resident in Co. Sligo. The scheme will be continued and expanded in 2020 and is open to applicants across the country. Recognising the important role that the SPSV sector can play in demonstrating electric vehicle (EV) technology to a wider audience I have also agreed, under the <i>Climate Action Plan,<\/i>to improve the value of the eSPSV grant to those transitioning to wheelchair accessible electric SPSVs. This will help to make electric vehicles available to a greater number of our citizens. Furthermore, I have secured &euro;1.5m of funding in 2020 to install dedicated fast charging infrastructure for the SPSV sector.  <\/p><p>In the Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) sector, e.g. buses and trucks, electric technology is not quite as advanced as it is for smaller vehicles.  To assist the transition of the bus and truck fleets to low emission vehicles, I intend to introduce a new Alternative Fuels Heavy Duty Vehicle Purchase Grant scheme in 2020. Under this scheme, which will operate at a national level, it is envisaged that grants of up to 30% of the cost differential between a traditional fossil-fuelled HDV and an equivalent alternatively-fuelled vehicle will be available. Complementary supports such as introduction of a new reduced tolling incentive regime for alternatively-fuelled Heavy Duty Vehicles will also be introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme","counter":600,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[48478\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the timeline for the construction and funding of the eastern Garavogue Bridge in County Sligo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":602,"content":"<p>The Eastern Garovogue and approach road project is one of the 12 regional and local road improvement schemes identified in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 for implementation during the Plan period, subject to necessary approvals.

F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also a member of Comhairle na Tuaithe (under the responsibility of the Minister for Rural and Community Development) which was, earlier this year, given a strengthened mandate with regard to the sustainable development of the outdoor recreation sector in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Data","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[48514\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount invested by way of capital grants or other financial assistance to providing and improving facilities the various sporting organisations nationally in the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>Details of all allocations and payments under the Sports Capital Programme are published on the Department's website at .<\/p><p>Details of all allocations under the Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme are published on the Department's website at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Events","counter":634,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[48515\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which ongoing efforts continue to be made to encourage international sporting bodies to include Ireland in their list of locations for major events; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":636,"content":"<p>The hosting of major sports competitions, in both participative and spectator sports, can provide great opportunities to showcase Ireland and drive international visitor numbers.  In addition, the media coverage of sports events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, I am very supportive of the work of the tourism agencies and the national governing bodies of sport to attract international events, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs and benefits involved in any State financial support, in particular the number of overseas visitors.  <\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides financial assistance, subject to eligibility criteria, to applicants who are proposing to bid to host international events (including sporting events) in Ireland that would attract significant numbers of international visitors.  When an event with international tourism appeal is confirmed for Ireland, Tourism Ireland would then promote it in relevant markets overseas.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of forthcoming sporting events, Ireland will host four games as part of the UEFA EURO 2020 football tournament in June 2020 - three group games and one round of 16 game.  The bid to host was a collaborative effort between the Football Association of Ireland, Dublin City Council and my Department.  In the sport of golf, the return of the Ryder Cup to Ireland in 2026 was announced in July of this year.  This major event will take place in Adare, Co Limerick, and officials in the Department and the State agencies will be working closely with the event organisers in relation to the planning and organisation of the event. <\/p>  <p>  Minister Ross and I also support efforts to explore possibilities to host other major sporting events.  With regard to soccer, we welcomed the announcement by the FAI and IFA of their intention to submit a joint bid to host the UEFA European Under 21 Championships in 2023.  In addition, the national football associations of the United Kingdom and Ireland are in discussions about the feasibility of bidding to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup.  This consideration is at an early stage.  <\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have both supported the bid to host the European Cross-Country Championship, which was successful and now will be hosted in Dublin in December 2020.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Policy","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL04100"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[48516\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100061#WRL04200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the degree to which he encourages overseas bodies to use Ireland as a base for their international conferences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>The matter raised by the Deputy is an operational matter for the tourism agencies.

first to recognise that due to improvements in health and work conditions people have the capacity and the desire to work beyond what would traditionally have been seen as a retirement age.  Second, as  life expectancy increases, to help maintain the sustainability of our pensions system.  In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, legislation passed in 2011 provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  Many other EU\/OECD countries are making similar provisions. The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy. <\/p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.   <\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age, and so the question of claiming a social protection payment would not arise.  Where this is not possible and a person ceases their employment before reaching State pension age, they may if they do not find alternative employment apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.   <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement age of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100062#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Data","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100062#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[48384\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100062#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 303 of 24 October 2019, the number of the women in receipt of the State pension (contributory) based on pre-September 2012 bands that are not in the highest band that would have qualified for a higher band if they could be assessed under the homemakers' scheme or the home carers&rsquo; scheme; the number of the 23,822 women listed in the highest band of the current State pension (contributory) based on pre September 2012 bands that include the 10,808 women that fall within the invalidity saver cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":682,"content":"<p>The Homemakers Scheme was introduced on 6 April 1994 to make qualification for state pension (contributory) easier for a claimant who took time out of the workforce for caring duties. It allows up to 20 years (since 1994) spent caring for children under 12 years of age or for an incapacitated person(s) to be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions and credits, and for homemaker credits to be awarded for homemaking periods of less than a full contribution year.  <\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, HomeCaring Periods were introduced as part of the interim total contributions approach (TCA) to the calculation of pension entitlement for those state pension (contributory) customers born on or after 1 September 1946 and in receipt of pension on post-2012 Budget rates.  The TCA provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods in that pension entitlement calculation for applicants who took time out of the workplace for parenting or caring duties.  I am advised that it is unknown how many on pre 2012 reduced rates would qualify for a higher rate under the TCA. These claims were not reviewed as they were not affected by the 2012 Budget changes. <\/p>  <p>  According to the most recent records of my Department, 39,557 women are in receipt of state pension (contributory) under the pre-Budget 2012 rate bands at less than the maximum rate of pension. Of these, 707 women could not have benefited from the Homemakers Scheme as they were pension age before the introduction of the scheme in 1994.  The provisions of the Homemakers Scheme would have been applied in processing the remaining claims if the persons concerned had advised of their caring duties in their application.  It should be noted, however, that while a person&rsquo;s yearly average may increase under the provisions of the Homemakers Scheme, it may still remain within the same rate band and thus may not result in an increase in pension.  <\/p>  <p>  The 23,833 women on the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) are those who have been assessed with a yearly average of 48 contributions or over.

It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been completed and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  I intend to bring a comprehensive package of social housing reform measures to Government in the near future and the review of the Tenant Purchase Scheme will be published as part of that process.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100063#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Funding","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100063#WRN01100"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[48339\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100063#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the level of funding provided for group sewerage schemes in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>The following table sets out the recoupment by my Department to local authorities each year since 2016 for Group Sewerage Schemes. <table>    <tr>       <th><div> Local Authority<\/div><\/th>       <th><div> 2016<\/div><\/th>       <th><div> 2017<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>2018 <\/div><\/th>       <th><div> 2019 - (up to 18\/11\/19)<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><div> &euro;<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> &euro;<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> &euro;<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> &euro;<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><div> 80,274.36<\/div><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><div> 8,384.35<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td><div> 59,270.34<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> 7,806.84<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> 4,947.54<\/div><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><div> 794.50<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals<\/td>       <td><div> 59,270.34<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> 88,081.20<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> 4,947.54<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> 9,178.85<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100063#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Data","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100063#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[48345\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100063#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the average monthly housing assistance payment for each quarter of 2019 to date; the average monthly HAP payment for each county; the number of recipients by county for each quarter of 2019 to date, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":731,"content":"<p>Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals.

From the outset, I would like to clarify that this development comprises homes that will be made available for purchase under the affordable dwelling purchase arrangements rather than being made available for rental.<\/p><p>In line with the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland to support the delivery of more affordable homes to buy or rent, this Government has allocated &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), from 2019 to 2021, to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 homes on local authority lands.  This funding is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for affordable housing and the viability to deliver such housing from their sites. <\/p><p>To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will see the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.  One of the 35 approved projects, is the aforementioned Boherboy Road development in Cork City Council.<\/p><p>This site at Boherboy is local authority owned lands and has received approval for SSF funding of almost &euro;5m for infrastructure that will support the delivery of 116 affordable homes.  In addition, 37 further homes will be made available on the site for social housing.  The homes made available for affordable purchase will be a mix of detached, semi-detached and terraced with a variety of house types and designs.

The internationally recognised practice of heritage-led regeneration shows that heritage can be used to create a desirable place where people can live, visit and do business. Heritage-led regeneration brings economic benefits enabling our historic towns to prosper through increased visitor numbers and decreased numbers of vacant buildings and commercial premises. This initiative is presently targeted at towns with an indicative minimum population level of 1,500 people.<\/p><p>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme, however, operated by my colleague, Michael Ring, TD, Minister for Rural and Community Development has a category of funding which includes towns and villages with a population under 1,500 people. It is a key part of this Government's Action Plan for Rural Development and is part of a package of national and local support measures to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland.  Further details are available on that Department&rsquo;s website - .  <\/p><p>In my own Department, I recently launched a &euro;4.3m fund for conservation and repair of Ireland&rsquo;s protected historic structures through 2 grant schemes, the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Historic Structures Fund, both of which are administered through the local authorities. These schemes are provided by my Department to assist the owners of protected buildings and structures with meeting their obligations to care for and safeguard our built heritage. Applications can be made to Local Authorities until 31 January 2020 and both schemes are open to applications for projects across the Country, including in towns with a population of under 1,500.  Further details are available on my Departments website and on all local authority websites. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112100063#WRN05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
