I thank the Chair for facilitating this legislation quite quickly and for his work on the pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  I apologise for the slight delay at the start of the meeting.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the Sick Leave Bill 2022 with the committee today.  It will ensure that for the first time in Ireland all employees will have a statutory entitlement to paid sick leave if they are unable to work due to illness or injury.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic exposed the vulnerable position of many people, especially in the private sector, when it comes to missing work due to illness.  Our view, which I think is shared by the majority of the committee, is that workers should not feel they have to go to work when sick because they will lose all of their income otherwise.  It is not just bad for them, it is bad for public health, as sick workers might infect colleagues, clients and customers and be more likely to make a mistake, injure themselves or do harm to others as well.<\/p> <p>  As a starting point, this scheme will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for illness benefit from the State kicks in.  As we know, illness benefit can last up to two years.  Where an employee has an extended period of illness, this scheme will operate seamlessly with the existing illness benefit scheme and system.  Once employees have exhausted their entitlement to paid sick leave from their employers, they will move on to illness benefit paid by the State, provided they have made adequate PRSI contributions.<\/p> <p>  The length of coverage will increase over time and eventually provide for an entitlement to ten working days or two weeks annually in the fourth year of the scheme's operation.<\/p><p> Events of the last two years have shown how necessary this legislation is.  While it represents a new expense for some businesses, and we understand the pressure that will put on them, it is common across Europe that employers cover a portion of sick leave costs.  We have taken care to ensure that costs are not excessive.  That is why there is a four-year lead-in period with this legislation.<\/p><p> Some have said that they think the Bill goes too far, and others argue that it does not go far enough.  We believe, in general, that we have got the balance right with the legislation we are proposing here.<\/p><p> Ultimately this Bill means that workers will not have to attend work while sick through economic necessity.  This will be one of the positive legacies to emerge from the pandemic.  While Deputies might differ on the approach, we are all agreed that this legislation is the right thing to do and the sooner we can implement it, the better.<\/p><p> I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill at the earlier Stage and I look forward to our discussion here this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#A00700","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>A number of amendments tabled on Committee Stage have, unfortunately, been ruled out of order.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 9 in the name of Deputy O'Reilly form a composite proposal which would allow employees to self-certify for sick leave instead of being required to provide a medical certificate.  We will come to all of these as we go through the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 7, in the name of Deputy Paul Murphy, would require a medical certificate only after the tenth day of sick leave.  Amendment No. 8, in the name of Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, would only require a medical certificate after three consecutive days of illness.  These amendments would create a statutory entitlement to sick leave pay for public servants above and beyond what is currently the case under regulations.  This would potentially lead to greater costs for the Exchequer arising from sick leave payments.<\/p> <p>  Sick leave remuneration for public servants is determined by way of ministerial regulations made under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The current regulations under the Act are the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations 2014, Sl 124 of 2014.  Under those regulations, public service employees must provide a medical certificate to qualify for sick pay, except where a local employer decides to waive that requirement.  In accordance with Standing Order 212(3), the amendments must be ruled out of order as they have the potential to impose a charge on the revenue.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 25 and 27, in the name of Deputy Paul Murphy, would remove the 20-week cap on the amount of remuneration that may be awarded by the Labour Court.  This exposes the Exchequer to higher costs in the event of a public sector employee winning a case.  In accordance with Standing Order 212(3), the amendments must be ruled out of order as they have the potential to impose a charge on the revenue.<\/p> <p>  The remaining amendments will be considered at today's meeting.  The groupings are as follows: amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 16 to 18, inclusive; amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive; amendments Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive; amendments Nos. 20 to 24, inclusive; and amendments Nos. 26 and 28.

We want to delete the same lines and to insert, \"An employee shall be entitled to up to and including 10 statutory sick leave days in a year, or such additional number of statutory sick leave days (if any) up to 30, as may stand specified from time to time by order of the Minister ...\"  The Minister would have within his or her power the ability to increase that to 30 days over a period of time, but we have to start with ten.

What we are trying to achieve here is that, as a starting point, this scheme will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for illness benefit kicks in, and that can kick-in for two years thereafter.  I want the members to bear that in mind as we have this discussion.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has been very clear on the medium-term plan to make sure employers know what their obligations will be.  The statutory entitlement to sick pay will be phased in as part of a four-year plan and will initially be three days a year once the Bill is enacted and commenced.  This will effectively fill the gap in coverage, as I said, caused by illness benefit waiting days.  It is important that we close that gap at the outset.  Closing the gap of current waiting days before being able to access illness benefit will help reduce the numbers of sick employees presenting for work.<\/p> <p>  This four-year plan takes account of the current economic climate and the existing financial pressures on businesses.  We must bear in mind what businesses have been through for the past couple of years with Covid and what is now happening in relation to the war in Ukraine.  The latter is putting extreme pressure on businesses.  We want to get the balance right here with this legislation but it is also important that we try to protect those jobs that are there and give businesses a change to adjust to this scheme over a couple of years as it is being implemented.  The number of days will increase incrementally, with the goal that employers will eventually cover the cost of ten sick days per year from year four.<\/p><p> We fully understand many businesses are struggling with additional costs because of the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit, our coming out of Covid and the disruption these have brought.  That is why we have chosen to phase in the new right.  While we all agree it is important to introduce this right, there has to be a balanced approach to it.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 16 would provide that the number of paid sick leave days could not be reduced below ten by any ministerial order.  As statutory sick leave will be introduced at three days per year, this amendment would not align with the timeline of the scheme proposed.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 17 would not restrict the number of days by which statutory sick leave could increase in any given year.  Subsection (2)(b)(ii) currently stipulates that the Minister may not increase the number of sick leave days by more than three in any 12-month period.  This provides certainty to employers by ensuring that unexpectedly large increases in the number of sick leave days will not be introduced.  This is a sensible approach that allows businesses to plan ahead and anticipate the potential cost increases, which are significant for many, certainly for SMEs.<\/p><p> Similarly, providing the Minister with the ability to increase the number of sick leave days by ten days, as per amendment No. 18, under any one order would be disproportionate and unfair to employers.  Such a dramatic increase in coverage could have unintended negative consequences, with employers unable to afford the associated costs.  Again, we have to bear in mind that it jeopardises jobs if we force too many costs on employers.  We are trying to get the balance right.  I ask the members to try to understand our approach and that there will be incremental growth over a four-year period.  This, we believe, is balanced and fair, and recognises the circumstances we are in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#B01900","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Where did three days come from?  Why is it three rather than two, four or five?  How did the Minister of State come up with three?  We are being asked to agree to three days because it is to increase to ten.  We are being reassured that this will happen but the Bill does not provide such reassurance.  Stitched into it is a wide-open loophole that means the current or another Government may well decide not to increase the number.  The factors the Minister must have regard to in section 6(1) in deciding whether to increase the number include the state of the economy generally, the business environment, national competitiveness, the potential for any disproportionate or adverse effect on the economy generally, specific sectors of the economy, and employers and employees.  The Minister must also have regard to the views of employer representative bodies.  I would bet quite a large amount of money that the view of the employer representative bodies on increasing the number of sick-pay days will be that we should not be increasing it because the employers do not want to pay for it.<\/p> <p>  Even if we get to ten days, does the Minister of State not accept that we would still be far behind what is normal in many countries in Europe?  In Austria, for example, workers are entitled to between ten and 16 weeks.  It deals in weeks, not days, on 100% pay.  In the Netherlands, people can get sick pay for up to two years.

The legislation is designed to facilitate whatever Minister sits in this chair in the years ahead.  We need to bear in mind that the number today is zero and that we are asking businesses and employers to adapt to a new statutory sick pay scheme, which they are paying for.  It is only right and fair that we introduce it over a period of time.  It is about the management of businesses.  Some would say it is not about management, but we are trying to get the balance right.  The measure does not favour any one sector or social partner over another; it is about achieving a balance that protects jobs, will continue to grow jobs and enable businesses to continue while recognising the benefits for everybody of having a statutory sick pay scheme.  It is a matter of introducing it at a pace that is manageable.<\/p> <p>  What is proposed compares quite well with the arrangements in many European countries.  The number of days varies from country to country.  The majority have around ten days or fewer.  Australia, New Zealand and Canada all have the ten days.  The commitment by the Cabinet, as expressed by the T&aacute;naiste in D&aacute;il debates and discussions here, is to go to ten days over four years.  The legislation does not cap that.  There is no ambition capped either.  There is flexibility for future Ministers to go beyond ten days if they so choose.  In the legislation, we are asking that the Minister reflect on the circumstances in the country on any given day.  The Minister must consult not only employers but also all social partners.  This was expressly requested by this committee.  It is written into the Bill.<\/p> <p>  The reason the measure was suggested for regulation, not legislation, is that this is the best way to adapt to any situation as a country.  The members have been discussing here for nearly a year the permits legislation that I am trying to adapt and make changes to.  Since the provisions are expressed in primary legislation rather than regulations, it is very hard for us to work with them and make any changes needed or recommended by most people here.  If the provisions are in regulations, the Minister can adjust and make changes much more quickly on behalf of the country at the right time to reflect current conditions.  That is why we are not over-prescribing in primary legislation.  Primary legislation does not always work to the benefit of everybody.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the three days, following the discussion in the very early stages of this in the D&aacute;il a commitment was made by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, to introduce this legislation.  Thereafter, there was consultation across all the Departments and among all the social partners.  Members of this committee and many others went through all this.  We fixed on an entitlement of three days to begin with to close the initial gap associated with the illness benefit because nobody gets anything for the first three days as matters stand.  That was the most important gap that the T&aacute;naiste wanted to close.  The aim was to build on that thereafter.  That is why we introduced the three days, as well as consultation with everybody.<\/p> <p>  It is proposed to have three days, moving to ten days within four years.  We believe this is a fair and reasonable request of employers.  Members should bear in mind that employers are paying for this.  That must be understood and accepted.  Future Ministers can decide to make changes to the proposal if they want, but this is what we are recommending at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I hope members will understand that our job in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is to get the balance right to protect workers at work, prevent the unnecessary spread of illness, encourage people to stay at home when unwell, try to cover the cost of their staying at home, and recognise that employers of all sizes have to implement this scheme as a statutory sick pay scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#C00500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I, like other members I am sure, want to see a sick pay scheme implemented.  The Minister of State pointed out that employers are paying for this, which is the truth of it.  In some of the preamble to the Bill he tried to give credence to the difficulty out there and he mentioned the social partnership.  I wish to raise two matters.  One is something I asked before and raised in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions which is why Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, is not part of this leave Bill.  I do not believe small businesses are being properly represented as part of the social partnership agenda.<\/p> <p>  Further, employers will be quite willing to look at expanded sick pay schemes but the problem is that they are paying for it.  One of the things this Bill does not address is any support for small or micro-enterprises which may have to take on people to fill a role while an employee is sick, which happens quite a good deal in many industries.<\/p> <p>  On the last occasion I asked that the Minister of State might look at tabling an amendment to provide a tax rebate, or something like that, for this double whammy where a small business has to put up the resources for the scheme and then has to pay, possibly through an agency, to find support and help.  These employers are getting no support for that.  The larger employers, as we know, already have sick pay schemes in place because they can afford them.  The problem here is that we are trying to legislate for everybody but, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, this is going to have an effect on employers.  We cannot have the idea of having unlimited sick days but we want to start with something fair.<\/p> <p>  This is where I would be coming from.  I ask the Minister of State to consider tabling an amendment on some type of tax rebate scheme, which may be one of the easiest things to do, to take account of small and micro-enterprises which are going to be significantly impacted, particularly as this scheme is extended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#D00100","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his work on this Bill to date.  The Bill is very welcome but it has caused a great deal of concern among small business owners.  We are all aware well aware that the bulk of businesses are small, owner-operated businesses.  This will pose an additional headache for them while at the same time they recognise that the Bill and the statutory right to sick leave and pay needs to be enshrined in legislation.<\/p> <p>  It is important safeguards are put in place for those small businesses and, following on from what the previous speaker said, those small businesses feel greatly at risk.  We are very much an enterprise committee here and there is an onus on us to help cultivate and generate enterprise across the country.  Several small business owners I have spoken to would see this scheme as a possible deterrent to them taking on staff in the future.  There has to be scope to look at the possibility of a rebate scheme where employers can avoid a double whammy.  This has been raised with us by many representative groups and small business owners who will have to pay the sick pay and, in the case of a business that perhaps only employs three or four people and is public-facing, will have to bring in a person in to cover that work for the day.  They will face a double whammy.  Some engagement with Revenue should be possible so that we can come up with a rebate scheme that ensures those businesses are not penalised.  Even with the smallest of businesses, which may not have the most sophisticated risk matrix, they will operate that risk matrix but within their own heads and will see this as a high-risk scenario.  Provision needs to put in place so that they are not being penalised on the double.  I would hope this suggestion can be considered in an amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#D00200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his work on this Bill, which I am fully behind.

We are trying to strike a balance and everybody recognises that workers need a right to sick pay and that traditionally this was provided only by the State and the employer did not play any role and that was not fair or balanced.  The difficulty with the proposal, and I can understand how others can say that sick pay should be extended, is that the reality is that the State takes on the responsibility after a certain period of time and sustains pay but in many workplaces, of course, there are much better terms than the State arrangement alone.  We are trying, therefore, to provide a safety net for people who are not in those more generous schemes in order to balance that against the reality that other Deputies referred to, which is that there are many small businesses with a small number of employees who are customer-facing and do not have the sorts of options to substitute and to cover which larger employers who are not in the customer-facing business have.   This means that they have to get somebody in when somebody is out sick.  There is this balance to be struck and I am unsure as to how it is to be resolved.<\/p> <p>  At a minimum, I would hope the Minister of State would commit to having a review done after a reasonably short period to see how this is impacting on those smaller employers, with the possibility of some form of relief for them other than the long-stop one which is in the Bill of proving inability to pay.  That is a fairly draconian system in order to establish that level of proof.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is quite correct in that we are trying to strike a balance.  Employers have a responsibility here but we have to try design that responsibility in a way that does not unfairly impact on certain types of employer.  There is scope to try to explore that further before Report Stage, if the Minister of State can do so, or at least by way of a review at a very early date to address the fears of excessive burdens being placed on some of these labour-intensive customer-facing roles and the need for some relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#D00400","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>A number of issues have been raised.  I share the concerns raised by the previous speakers.  To address Deputy Bruton, I have committed to a number of employers that we will track and review this to see if we are putting jobs in jeopardy or are placing an excessive a cost on businesses.  The T&aacute;naiste is very clear that we will phase this in in order to give such businesses time to adapt and to cope with it.  It could potentially increase the payroll bill by 0.8% to 1% in some cases, which may put extreme pressure on businesses, certainly from a cash point of view if one has to replace customer-facing roles.  We will monitor this and will continue to address the concerns of Deputies Shanahan, Flaherty, Duffy and Bruton, and others who are concerned about engaging with the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, community as we track and watch this as it is rolled out.  We will then seek to find ways to support, where possible, these businesses.<\/p> <p>  Rebates are not very proportionate and have not worked very well in the past when it came to other redundancy schemes, and so on.  All of us want to ensure we do not jeopardise any jobs or businesses.  There is, as had been referred to by Deputy Bruton, in section 10 an inability to pay provision but that may come too late for some businesses or is a hard bar to reach.  It has not been used, as far as I am aware, in the minimum wage legislation.  We will track this and try to find other ways to support the SME community, if needs be, through our business development agencies, such as our local enterprise organisation, LEO, network or Enterprise Ireland.  We are trying to find ways to provide support, if needs be.  We will monitor this but such a provision does not belong in legislation.  What is important here is that we introduce a statutory sick pay scheme and that we track that aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  This is similar to the provision where the Minister of the day may adjust and make recommendations every 12 months to increase this.  The effect on the economy at that time will be tracked, not just for employers but also for employees in terms of cost of living and so on.  That will be monitored to get the balance right, which I stress here.<\/p> <p>  We recognise this is not the ideal time to bring in this legislation given what has happened over the past number of years with Covid-19 and Ukraine.  We recognise also, however, that we are an outlier in Europe by not having a statutory sick pay scheme.  It is important we bring one in and the commitment was made on the floor of the D&aacute;il that we would do that.  We must ensure we do so in a manner in which businesses can cope with it.<\/p> <p>  There is a commitment to keep PRSI as low as we possibly can for employers, given with the effect that this could have on employees.  This scheme may limit the need to increase PRSI on employers, so there may be an offset of cost there.  That is something that we will track and keep an eye on as well.<\/p> <p>  I have talked to many in the SME community and I have met many businesses, as has the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, over perhaps the past year to 18 months and have discussed the legislation with them.<\/p><p>We have been trying to encourage them to work with us on this scheme and to recognise the importance of protecting their employees and ensuring that employees do not feel that they have to go to work.  Everyone would benefit from that - other staff, customers and clients.  Many members of the business community throughout the country tell us that they cannot get staff and access the skills they need.  Many of those are customer-facing roles.  If we can strengthen overall terms and conditions, we believe it will assist in competing for talent.<\/p><p> In the European context, we are out of sync by not having a statutory sick pay scheme.  We are constantly striving to get the balance right between protecting employees and protecting employers.  The Government's response in recent years has shown that we are on the side of job creators as well as employees, in light of our supports during Covid, which were of equal benefit to both.  We are introducing this legislation in that spirit and in a balanced manner, with an implementation phase of four years committed to by the Cabinet.  I hope members will accept that we are doing our best to get the balance right.  We recognise that it puts pressure on SMEs.  Larger companies can probably absorb these costs.  It is fair to say that many employers already have their own sick pay schemes.  While many others do not have formal schemes, they operate some schemes, look after their staff well and facilitate them when they are sick or have other commitments.  There is a balance.  This Bill puts a formal scheme in place, but many employers already operate within this space well, and we should recognise that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#D00500","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I do not wish to prolong the debate unnecessarily because we have work to do.

This is an important issue.  Workers should be entitled to sick pay from the moment they start work.  The consequence of the requirement for 13 continuous weeks is the exclusion of many vulnerable workers.  It will discriminate and disproportionately affect women, to a significant degree.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has written to the T&aacute;naiste pointing out that it: &quot;<font color=\"#333333\">will leave hundreds of thousands of mostly women and foreign-born essential workers employed in low-pay jobs, who routinely have their service broken by their employer, without coverage for three months each year.&quot;  <\/font>That happens all the time in childcare, for example, where workers, 98% of whom are female, are let go over the summer period and rehired in September.  It will also massively and disproportionately affect young workers, more than a third of whom are on temporary contracts and will not be covered for the first 13 weeks.  The basic point is that you are not any less likely to get sick when you are on a temporary contract or in an industry where you are laid off over the summer because your employer breaks your service.  It is not your fault and there is no reason you should not be entitled to 100% sick pay from day one at work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#F00800","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>As has been outlined, the requirement for continuous service will, in effect, leave hundreds of thousands of workers outside the scheme.

It is a tactic of employers to lay off workers to keep them on their toes, and there is no point saying that it is not.  I am not referring to all or most employers, but some are doing it.  The need for continuous service means one is continuously having to build service.<\/p> <p>  I am not hostile to the notion of a service requirement.  It is done in other legislation but this effectively puts people, specifically women, workers on low incomes and foreign-born workers, as outlined by ICTU, outside of the scheme when they need the scheme more than anyone.

Sickness can strike anyone at any time, as we have seen during Covid.  It does not seem to me to have a foundation to say the right should be deferred for a period.  Probation is not about sickness; it is about reliability and other things.  If someone is sick and has produced a medical certificate to show that, I do not see how not offering it from the first day is justifiable.

I ask that when the Minister and Minister of State consider the amendment that they ensure the people who are intended to be captured in it do not have an additional requirement.  Reference has been made to the need for a worker to be repeatedly employed.  Let us say we stick with the 13 weeks, then a worker will end up with a 26-week requirement in a certain instance.  Let us say a worker signs his or her first contract at the start of 2000 and qualifies after 13 weeks, then experiences a period of being laid off, then signs another contract at the start of 2001 and has a another 13-week period, that means that worker will have needed a 26-week period to qualify when another worker would only have a 13-week period, assuming that we stick with the latter period.  If there is a service requirement, then it cannot be doubled only for the person who finds himself or herself in the precarious situation of having rolling contracts.  I ask the Minister of State to keep that practical aspect in mind.<\/p> <p>  I hope to support the amendment but the result of it cannot impose an additional requirement on a person.  We have already established these people are among the most vulnerable workers in the State and, therefore, the Government cannot make the period of 26 weeks or double whatever the service qualification is going to be.  Of course, if the Minister of State accepts the amendments tabled by either of my colleagues, then he would not have that problem as employees would qualify from day one.  If that is not the way the Minister of State is going to tackle this matter, then, if there is a service requirement, it cannot be double the period for someone on a low income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#G00150","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>To be clear, it is not the intention to impose additional requirements on anybody.

Let us consider a pure and simple situation where someone is not going to have his or her service broken but starts work somewhere and is not entitled to sick pay for the first 13 weeks.  The explanation the Minister of State gave is that the employee does not have a relationship with his or her employer at that stage.  If one is a worker and a boss asks for something to be done in work, the worker cannot say to him or her that there is no work relationship yet.  It is a contract, one must work, one is being paid, one is treated as a worker and one has all the responsibilities of a worker who has been in employment for more than 13 weeks but for some reason, we are arbitrarily saying this worker does not get the rights that go with his or her employment in terms of sick pay.<\/p> <p>  The commitment is welcome in terms of the issue the Minister of State is dealing with as it is a large part of the problem.

It is important to recognise that a relationship of some sort of employment would be necessary before these entitlements would kick in and we suggest 13 weeks.  Originally, the time was around six months but after the consultation, in conjunction with the members, and pre-legislative scrutiny done by the committee, the period was reduced to 13 weeks.

The intention is to increase the entitlement but it is a little bit like the right that an employer has to say no to remote working.  There are many reasons there will be no increase but there is not an awful lot in it to suggest that other interests, such as those that would be in favour of workers, would also be considered.

What we have been arguing for and trying to bring into law is a basic provision to prevent people from feeling they have to go to work when sick and so they will get paid to feed their children.

Other members are either not accepting or have forgotten the reality that obtains when an economy loses competitiveness on the scale that we experienced for a period.  I am referring to the impact of the collapse of businesses into which employers have put a lifetime of work and to workers being left high and dry following the collapse of a business into which they have put a lifetime of work.  Those are genuine considerations.  Economies must not refuse to recognise that competitiveness is part of being successful and that enterprising people are needed.  Getting profits from one's enterprise is not some sort of error; it is what allows an enterprise to be successful, export, win new business and create wealth for everyone to share.<\/p> <p>  The question of balance the Minister of State is trying to defend is absolutely authentic.  Ireland has the history to prove it.  We went through long years when we failed to recognise the importance of enterprise of competitiveness, and we paid dearly for it.  We have succeeded over several decades, despite the financial collapse, in building a balanced economy that can provide opportunities to introduce legislation like this and do other things that we could not do for years.  People have to be conscious that having a provision that implies the competitiveness of our businesses and economic climate is important in deciding what new obligations we impose or rights we create is just sensible.  Trying to stick our heads in the sand and say it is not part of the balance that the Minister is obliged to strike is short-sighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#J00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I wish to follow on from Deputy Bruton's point on balance.  I said at meetings of this committee before that I have a slight problem at times with some of the narration on employers.  I believe it was Deputy Paul Murphy who said it is the employees who are creating all the wealth.  Employers have to put the structures together for productivity to happen.  There is a balance to be struck.  I am certainly on the side of employees but we must remember what Deputy Bruton just alluded to: one has to be cognisant of what is going on in the economy.  We are trying to do something now that we have not done before, namely, introduce a statutory sick-pay scheme for all workers.  I welcome that but do not subscribe to the idea that we can just ramp up year on year without being cognisant of what is happening in the economy and the headwinds that businesses are facing.<\/p> <p>  To return to a point I made earlier, small and medium enterprises, which employ close to a million people in this country, are not being properly spoken for here.  As public sector workers who get our increments, it is very easy for us to go into the D&aacute;il and vote further expenditure into the pot to pay for the costs.  That does not happen in the private sector; in the private sector, one has to try to create a business margin wherever possible.  When margins are affected by increased costs, it is very difficult to combat.  When the Government says one must take on increased costs again that will impinge upon margins, we have to be mindful that it is a competitiveness issue.  We have built very efficient companies in this country because we are agile; however, when the public sector and public policy require new machinations for businesses that will add to their costs, it is a concern for them.  We have to be mindful of that.  Therefore, I believe that what is in the legislation, which is that the Minister must have regard to all the headwinds affecting competition and cannot just have a statutory increase of two, three or four days year on year, represents sound business and fiscal policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#J00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I have a couple of observations and comments.  We are not opposing Deputy O'Reilly's amendment but saying it is covered by the existing wording.  She will recognise that herself.  We have made changes on foot of this committee's recommendations before.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy wants to exclude employer representative bodies.  He is asking for the provision in this regard to be deleted.  I could not condone that; that would be illogical.  We are trying to bring forward legislation that is balanced.  The Deputy said he is a champion of the employee and takes credit for that, but our job in government is to strike a balance and ensure there are jobs for employees.  It is a two-way approach. <\/p> <p>  I do not apologise for acknowledging that employers will have to absorb the cost.  It is a public health measure.  It will protect everybody and gives sick workers the option to stay at home rather than going to work because they cannot afford not to.  That is what the legislation is being introduced for.  Employers do not pay for such a scheme at present but they will be paying for it.  We have to recognise that, and I do not apologise for doing so.<\/p> <p>  We all agree that it is appropriate to introduce a statutory sick-pay scheme.  Most employers I talk to acknowledge and accept that, as mentioned by Deputies Shanahan and Bruton, but they recognise they are trying to run businesses with massive costs and that have seen cost increases over the past couple of years.  Employers accept these schemes if they are fair, reasonable and manageable and if the cost can be absorbed over time.  We are trying to introduce the scheme over several years to allow employers time to adapt and, in some cases, change prices.  However, they have to remain competitive.  I sat with Deputy Bruton across the road back in 2011 and 2012 when we had an unemployment rate of 16% or 17%.  Everybody you spoke to wanted a job.  Of course we all want jobs with good terms and conditions, and we are constantly striving to have improvements in this regard, but we also want employers to create those jobs, take the risk, have the ambition to go further and take on international markets.  However, they have to be competitive to do that.<\/p> <p>  Profit levels vary from business to business; there is no doubt about that.  Some employers make great profits while others just barely cover their costs and pay their own wages.  We have to recognise that.  This legislation will apply across the board for all employers.  For a small shop on the corner employing 20 people, this legislation could add a cost of &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 per year.  We have to bear that in mind.  Prices may be passed on, profits may be reduced, and affected businesses may become less competitive.  There is a combination.  We are trying to introduce legislation that is balanced for everybody and introduces good pay and conditions and a statutory sick pay scheme that is needed and recognised.  We are an outlier in Europe &ndash; no one is denying that &ndash; but it is a matter of bringing in the scheme in a phased way that is manageable for everybody and does not jeopardise well-fought-for jobs.  Everybody here, across all Departments, has worked to create an environment that is conducive to job creation.  We must recognise that at the end of the day, the cost proposed is an additional one and that it will be imposed in a few months when we finish this work.  We must also recognise that the majority of employers want to do the right thing by their staff.  In the majority of cases, they do that and accommodate sick pay schemes or other informal arrangements at their own expense.  However, the Bill proposes a statutory scheme that will have to be implemented across every place of employment.  The balance is right.  I disagree with Deputy Paul Murphy that we should delete the reference to employer representatives.  That is totally imbalanced.  We are trying to achieve the right balance here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#J00500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I agree with several of the speakers, including the Minister of State, that this Bill is very much about balance.

I would sooner be in politics because it is very tough trying to run a business at the minute.  We have to accept that every action has a consequence.  The approach of the legislation, with its slow building of momentum and its addition of days over time, is the way to go.

It is that the business is not sustainable if it pays this out, and would not survive and it would put jobs at risk.  Nobody here wants to risk the jobs.  We all want to increase the number of jobs.  It is great that this country has had a jobs-led recovery.

We need to recognise that is often the SMEs that we are in here trying to support and that we talk about every day who need additional supports.

I ask that he please do that exercise and consider whether that would be an attractive option.  \"Attractive\" is the wrong word, but he should ask if there would be too many barriers in place.  If he does the maths he would see that the money that will be taken out, particularly to pay for the visit to the GP.  And we are talking about people who maybe do not go to the GP when they need to because money is a factor.  You are asking them to take that money out of a reduced take-home pay, in effect.  The Minister of State might think about that in the absence of availability of free GP care.  He cited all the European rates.

We recognise that this will increase the cost base of employers as well.  I know what the Deputy is saying.  Some of the countries I mentioned have different health mechanisms but, equally, the very lowest-paid and part-time workers in this country are more likely to have medical and GP visit cards.  It is necessary to go further to improve that, but it is outside the scope of this Bill.  It is a public health matter for the Department of Health, but there are commitments from the Government.  Others can make commitments to the same level if they wish and back it up with finance.  We have made our commitments and will continue to deliver on it.

It is a major improvement.  People can come in here and argue both sides.  They might argue that we are going too far or that we are not going not far enough.  We believe that at 70% it is a major improvement and gives the majority of workers a reasonable level of financial compensation for the days that they are sick.  Today, in the early days of sick leave - days one, two and three - workers gets no compensation whatever and they are not discouraged from going to work.  That was very evident during Covid.

It is a hell of a thing to be that worried, looking at your children or at your bills and knowing that you just cannot afford to get sick.  That is why we are bringing forward these amendments.

That is basically what we are saying in a roundabout way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#N00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I want to be clear.  We have done the maths on this scheme and we have come in at a figure of 70%, which we believe is fair and reasonable.  I do not want to give the impression that we are going to go away and come back on Report Stage with an increase on that because that is not the intention.  As with every discussion we have here, we will reflect on it, we will talk to the T&aacute;naiste and to our officials and we will work through this.  However, a lot of work has been done to achieve that target of 70%.  I did not say it is the norm across Europe to have 70%.  In many cases, it is a lot less and goes down as far as 25%, although I accept it is higher in some cases.  I am not saying that the norm is 70%.  We are above the norm or above the average.  We have put forward a reasonable proposal.<\/p> <p>  It is set out in regulation, for the reasons I laid out at the start.  That gives scope to the Minister to react and to adjust accordingly over the years, as opposed to having to bring in primary legislation, which can be very time-consuming.  That is there as well.<\/p> <p>  We share Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in&rsquo;s understanding and concerns and that is why we are bringing forward the legislation.  As a Government, we understand both the barriers that are out there and the necessity for this.  That is why we are proposing it and bringing it forward, with the support of the Deputies.  We are in tune with what is happening out there as well.  We think we have the balance right on this, and we will monitor the position in that regard.  It goes back to the balance and the costs that we put on employers because they also have to be able to balance their books and to survive.  We want to have as many jobs as possible.  We want people who are on low pay to be able to constantly aim to get a job, improve their job and build on their terms and conditions, if that is what they want to do, in order to be able to pay their bills and look after their families.  They should not have that fear that I know is out there, which is &ldquo;If one of us gets sick tomorrow or next week, how do we manage and how do we pay the bills?&rdquo;  That is why it is important to have good-quality, well-paying jobs with good terms and conditions.  For that to happen, we have to have a balanced enterprise environment to manage that and to create those jobs in the first place.<\/p> <p>  It is a chicken-and-egg situation, but we will check and monitor this.  It is in regulation that the Minister of the day can adjust this through regulation, as opposed to having to go back to primary legislation.  However, I do not want to give the impression that we have not done the maths and that we are going to run out and change it, and then come back here on Report Stage.  That is not the intention.  It is linked to the average wage.  We think we have the balance right.  As I said, naturally, we will at every stage review what we are doing and keep an eye on that.  However, that is where our homework has brought us to at this moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#N00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 21:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 4, after &ldquo;day&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which shall be their full daily rate&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>I will resubmit this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#N00500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, to delete lines 5 to 19. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#N00700","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 8, after &ldquo;pay,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which shall be 100 per cent&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>I will resubmit this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#N00900","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, to delete lines 10 to 13. <\/blockquote> <p>I will resubmit this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#N01100","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Section 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Sections 8 to 13, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>SECTION 14<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 25 has been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#N01600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 25 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 26 and 28 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#N01800","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 26:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, line 22, to delete &ldquo;20 weeks&rsquo; &rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2 weeks&rsquo; &rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>Amendments Nos. 26 and 28 amend the maximum penalty that the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court may award for an employer's breach of the obligations under the Bill to two weeks' remuneration.

In considering these amendments, I thought it particularly notable that the amount of leave set out in the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 is two weeks, and the penalty for non-compliance is two weeks' remuneration.

In terms of the balance of risk and reward for an employer not abiding by this legislation and not providing the sick pay required, and the employee having to go through all of the steps to prove that and then get a judgment, a penalty of two weeks' remuneration is extremely minimal.  The danger is that some employers, though not all, let us be clear, will decide that is a risk worth taking.  Even if they get caught out, it will only be a penalty of two weeks' remuneration.  That is very small, and I do not think it is in line with the idea of balance.  Surely there needs to be a considerable penalty to discourage attempts to evade or not implement this legislation, and not give workers the sick pay rights that we are talking about.  It is quite a serious change that I would be seriously opposed to.

Deputy Bruton described the draconian process that an employer has to go through to go at the Labour Court but it is the same for the worker, and it is a lot of energy and effort that they are going to have to put in to be able to take a case.  Doing so takes a long time.  If people are doing it on their own and they are not in a union, it is very arduous.  Given there is a cap at the end, someone's boss might say it is worth the risk.  The punishment should not just be in terms of restoring to the worker what they would have had.<\/p><p>It should also act as a deterrent for employers &ndash; not all employers, not even most employers, but we do not need to legislate for good and decent employers who are doing the right thing anyway.  We would not be here talking about this if there was no need for it.  We need to legislate for workers potentially being denied this leave where they are entitled to it.  It will take a long time for them to vindicate their rights through the procedures, especially if they are doing so on their own.  I would encourage people to join a union, which is the best way of going through these procedures anyway.<\/p><p> There needs to be a deterrent for employers.

As the Chairman has mentioned, I am joined by Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer.  While exercises on lessons learned on the pandemic are under way throughout the world, it can be seen from objective data relating to mortality, hospitalisation and vaccination uptake that the response to the pandemic in Ireland was among the best in the world.  <i>The Lancet<\/i>recently published a major global review of excess mortality during the pandemic with data from countries and subnational regions throughout the world.  It found that &quot;some countries ... such as Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and Cyprus had some of the lowest rates [of excess mortality] in the world, at less than 50 deaths per 100,000&quot;.  As members know, the rate in Ireland was 12.5 per 100,000 of population.  The cumulative rate of recorded Covid-19 deaths per million of population in Ireland remained consistently below the EU average throughout the pandemic.<br\/><br\/>Nonetheless we have seen over 7,000 deaths from Covid-19, as well as high levels of illness.<\/p><p>Both the societal and economic consequences of the past two years are well known to members of the committee, with the pandemic costing the Irish Exchequer circa &euro;20 billion to date.  In the context of such costs, it is right that governments and health systems around the world are now investing significantly in public health capacity.  In the Department of Health we are working to find new and innovative ways to refocus and to strengthen public health capacity.  A clear component of this is to develop leadership capacity in public health in order to strengthen and to prepare in the event of future pandemics.  This is set out in the programme for Government.<\/p><p> As I have set out previously, I had initial discussions with the CMO in August 2021 about his future plans, as did the Secretary to the Government.  Given the changing disease profile and concerns about emerging variants, those discussions were necessarily paused until earlier this year, when disease indicators confirmed that Ireland was in a much better epidemiological position.  At that point, and in the context of Ireland's future pandemic preparedness, the CMO raised with some third level institutions how the Department of Health could, in an innovative and responsive manner, strengthen the knowledge and practice of public health leadership.  These engagements had particular regard to public health protection, informing policymaking, understanding the role of public communications and behaviour change and research of relevance to these domains.  Over the course of these engagements, the proposal for a professorship emerged.  The purpose of this was to ensure that Dr. Holohan's expertise and skill set remained within the public service, with a view to strengthening public health capacity and leadership in Ireland.  In this role the Department's intention was for Dr. Holohan to lead the development and activities of collaboration between all universities and the health sector and to develop stronger links with the WHO and agencies of the EU.<\/p><p> On 25 February of this year, the CMO requested my support to progress a secondment to a Dublin university.  He indicated that he had informed the Secretary to the Government of this request.  In early March the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and I confirmed that I was working on the details of this arrangement, including the proposed research funding element.  I was aware that the Government had recently endorsed particular secondment arrangements to the university sector for senior civil servants.  Given his long and distinguished service and the crucial knowledge and ability he brought to bear in the pandemic, I felt it was equally important that Dr. Holohan's expertise be retained and utilised in the public sector.<\/p><p> Further discussions took place, and the Department issued a letter of intent to Trinity College on 16 March which set out the main details of the proposals, with further detail on secondment arrangements to be agreed between the relevant HR departments of Trinity College and the Department of Health.  As part of these proposed arrangements, the Department considered that the funding of Dr. Holohan's post was something that needed to be worked out but that the Department would support the development of this innovative approach to progressing an important initiative through dedicated additional research funding.  It was envisaged that this would involve competitive funding organised appropriately to support the spirit of the initiative outlined above.  The letter of intent therefore provided for Dr. Holohan's salary to be paid, in time, as part of a wider fund which, it was envisaged, could be administered by the Health Research Board, with details to be agreed between all three parties, as per the well-established practice of funding of health research in the third level sector.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, there are a number of well-recognised steps from the generation of an idea to the funding of a specific project or service that all Departments and Ministers must follow in order to allocate funds.  It was clear to me that this proposal was in line with the Government's commitment to investing in public health, as outlined in the programme for Government.  As such, and as required, funding of research in this regard by the Department would form part of the normal Estimates process, subject to ministerial and Cabinet approval.<\/p><p> It is a matter of regret to me that what I viewed as an important and innovative proposal for increasing our public health capacity in Ireland is now not going ahead.  I believe that this important work would have benefited greatly by being led by Dr. Holohan.  I believed when we conceived this proposal that it was essential that we continued to harness Dr. Holohan's knowledge and skills in the public interest, and I regret that that will no longer be possible.<\/p><p> I am happy to answer any questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Watt.

He talked very vaguely about things and said that the letter to Trinity was from the Department.  It was from Mr. Watt himself.  This is all about how Mr. Watt handled this matter.  He talked about that letter setting out the main draft details.  They are not really draft details.  They are very specific in the letter to Trinity.  He said that \"Dr. Holohan's post was something that needed to be worked out\" but that is not the impression that Mr. Watt gave in the letter to the Provost of Trinity.  Mr. Watt very specifically said: \"Under the proposed agreement the Department of Health commits to...\".  So Mr. Watt was committing the Department of Health to funding not only for the first year, a figure of &euro;2 million, but he was committing to multi-annual funding over a period of about ten years and that comes to a figure of about &euro;20 million, which is a very substantial amount of money.  In addition, there is the question of Dr. Holohan's salary over that period and, conservatively, that is probably in the region of &euro;3 million.  So Mr. Watt was making a commitment of &euro;23 million of taxpayers' money without the authority to do so.  This was not a vague thing where one was going to work out the details.  Mr. Watt committed in his letter to Trinity and I believe that he went beyond his authority and power to do that.  It is very hard to understand the mentality of somebody who would do that.  A sum of &euro;23 million is a huge amount of money so I would expect that a Secretary General in a Department would first get informal approval and certainly make the Minister aware of what he proposed to do.  Mr. Watt already committed taxpayers' money in that letter and I do not think that is an acceptable action for a Secretary General to take.<\/p> <p>  Where did Mr. Watt get the figure of &euro;2 million a year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#L01200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy, the letter says very clearly that the details have \"to be worked out\" and we were appointing somebody to work that out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The letter very clearly says that he commits to \"...ake an annual ring-fenced allocation of &euro;2M for the duration of the secondment\".

I will let others judge the impact of anything I have done over the course of the previous 15 years.  It does not take from any of that, in my view.  I would take the opportunity to say the things we have done in as a country in relation to the pandemic have not been things I have singularly done.  I have been visible in ways that many people have not been, but there has been enormous effort and I could start in the Department and go all the way from there to the front line of the health services.  Right across the board, people visible and others less visible have played a significant role in helping to support the country's response to the pandemic.  This is not credit that I either wish to or seek to take entirely unto myself.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned open-ended.  I did have the opportunity when I spoke to the committee the last day to make clear that from my point of view that was important.  The reason it was important was because if I was to say I was stepping back for a five-year period, as some have suggested, because that is the usual period of time for Department to Department secondments, it would create a doubt and uncertainty over the potential tenure of any successor of mine.  It would probably fetter the competition or likely make the competition for a successor less attractive.  Fewer people would apply and the possibility of me returning would arise for person who was successful.  I wanted to make clear, therefore, and this is the commitment I made to the Department out of respect for the role and the potential appointment of a successor, whoever that would be, that I did not have an intention in seeking to come back as CMO, even if in the secondment terms it meant that, strictly speaking, if I wished, I could come back at some point in some other role.  I wanted to be clear so that the ground could be left clear for another individual to decide to apply for the job and know he or she would have a full and clear mandate in doing that job in the same way as I had.  I thought that was important for the role.

If things had gone the way they should have, we would be in a different situation, addressing the challenges of the public health services in this country, which should get and need to get priority at this time.  Like other members, I believe there is still time to rescue the issue, and every effort should be made by everybody involved to ensure that will be done as a matter of urgency.  I ask Dr. Holohan and the Secretary General to re-examine the matter with a view to ascertaining whether it might be possible at this stage to salvage something in the interests of the country, the public health system and the reputations of all involved.<\/p><p> Long ago, I suggested that having learned from the experiences earlier during the Covid pandemic, we should apply them in general to the delivery of the public health services.  That was a natural thing to happen, and it should and must happen.  We must draw from the success of those experiences.  I fully appreciate the great effort made by Dr. Holohan, NPHET, the team in the Department of Health and the team throughout the country.  It was a very significant effort 24-7, on call all the time for a protracted period, in a way that was exemplary.  We have to record our appreciation of what has been done so far, which can be done again.  If we go off in different directions, however, as we are doing now, distracting ourselves and taking away the focus of attention from the issues that need to be dealt with, that would be sad and a failure.<\/p><p> I have no reason to be acrimonious towards anybody.  There is no need for it and no gain for anybody in it.  It does not work.  Members of the committee, Ministers or whoever being at loggerheads or cross-purposes with one another or with Departments serves no public purpose.  I hope lessons will be learned and I hope Mr. Watt has learned some lessons as well.  The lesson I see, as a former Minister of State like other members of the committee, is that there can be no proceeding anywhere without the approval and the updating of the Minister concerned.  It cannot be done.  It always ends in tears.  The necessity, therefore, is that wherever issues such as this one arise in the future, lessons that have been learned will be put into practice and, as a result, we can proceed knowing that whatever we do will be done in the national interest and the best interests of anybody.  It is important to recognise that, not least as we proceed to the challenges I referred to earlier.<\/p><p> In that context, there are now unprecedented waiting lists in every hospital in the country and in every department therein. It has been shown to the committee in the past that some people, in particular those who have been well placed in the services, can achieve great results.  It is a question of bringing them all together and putting them all in the same place at the same time in order that the sum total of what they can contribute individually will be seen to be greater, as I have no doubt will be the case.<\/p><p> In January of this year, I requested an urgent reappraisal of what was required, as our guests might recall.  At the time, Mr. Watt indicated he would tell us in November or December what might be possible, but it is too late for that.  That is way off and I think that, on reflection, he will have to admit that himself.  The necessity was to look at the issues that were now pertinent to the realm of the Department, and if we do not do that, we will be seen to have been negligent.  That is what future generations will say.  They will know full well that we have the capacity to take the steps that are expected of us, by whom I mean everybody involved at every level, from the public service, the political service and all that goes with that.  <\/p><p> As has been mentioned, lessons have been learned, but we have heard that phrase many times previously.  Why would it not have been possible to take account of the advice of committee members, for example?  We all had the feeling that we needed to divert our attention to the delivery of health services and put in place the necessary foundations for doing that straight away, not next November, December or the year after next but now?  It would be a simple step to take at this level and that needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p> I am sorry the reputations of many great contributors in the course of the pandemic have suffered, given it has been presented as though the system was doing something wrong.<\/p><p>The system was not doing something wrong.  It was attempting to keep on board all of the people who had a major contribution to make and continue to do so.<\/p><p> Reference was made to Dr. Holohan perhaps being able to look at this again.  I know that is difficult and he has made his own decisions, as he is entitled to do.  Dr. Holohan has also shown that he is committed to the public health system.  More than ever before, the public health service badly needs the expertise, leadership, concern, devotion and dedication of people who have been on the front line, or any line, of the pandemic.  I ask Dr. Holohan to consider this in the context of what might follow, so as not to lose all the information gleaned and all the expertise that is ready to be tapped for the public or for research insofar as the public health system is concerned.  That would be a disaster.  I do not want to continue incessantly as most of what I was going to say has already been said.  I wanted to emphasise that particular point.<\/p><p> With regard to senior officials and proceeding, we need senior officials with flair and innovative tendencies in the public service and I compliment those among them who have those qualities.  It is vitally important, however, that anything done is conveyed at an earlier stage to the political heads of Departments.  These are the persons who are supposed to know, and when they go on the public stage to discuss a particular subject they are entitled to have all of the information at their fingertips.  They need to be in control.  If they do not get information from the system in which they serve, they are no longer in control and they are boxing in the dark.  That does not work.  I hope that lesson has been learned and that with any such attempt in future not only will a letter or email be sent to the relevant people to apprise them of the particular situation, but that a copy will also be sent to whomever else might be involved.<\/p><p> I appeal to all concerned to think again about the position we are in now and the urgency of the matters that are ahead for the Department of Health and the health services.  We talk about this all the time.  It is not something we should refer to only for discussion.  We need action and the action can only come when the expertise, dedication and involvement of those dealing with the pandemic is refocused on the general delivery of health services, in particular the public health services.  That is all I want to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#Q01900","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan for that.  Now that we are through the latest wave of Covid, our focus is on the absolute public health needs, and particularly waiting lists.  We have an enormous challenge now because of the backlog of treatments.  We need to do everything we can.<\/p> <p>  I will mention two points.  There is a need to galvanise the system in dealing with challenges we now face, the more systemic challenge in the system.  We must galvanise the system in the way we managed to galvanise the system in responding to Covid.  That is very important.  People are suffering because they are waiting too long for treatment in many cases.  We need to have that same can-do spirit and the flair the Deputy mentioned is needed in that context.<\/p> <p>  My second point, to which the Chief Medical Officer has alluded, is that while the CMO is the public face of our response to the pandemic, along with Dr. Glynn at times, it is a team of people, including people in our Department, the HSE, the Department of the Taoiseach and many other Departments.  By the nature of it, someone has to lead that team and, in the case of a pandemic, someone had to be the public face.  It is very important to re-emphasise what the CMO said about many people being involved who, in my view, did a great service over the past years.  I thank Deputy Durkan for his comments in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The key thing now is for us to focus on what we must do for the health system to address the challenges.

The whole project is $3.8 billion.

It seems to be that this is rumbling on.  As highlighted, a huge amount of work has been done around Covid and in light of the global situation things happened.  However, over the past while, a couple of things have happened that are eroding people's trust.  At a time when we are still in a global pandemic and we still have arguably a healthcare crisis, the erosion of public trust in the system is not ideal.

In terms of the Department of Health, I would certainly be very proud of what the Department has delivered over the last number of years in incredibly difficult circumstances.  I think officials of the Department can be very proud of what they have achieved in navigating us through this crisis.  By its nature, there are always issues in health.  I do not listen to radio but I am told that on most mornings, of the first five or six items on \"Morning Ireland\", close to half, or the majority, are health issues.  The nature of health is the nature of the system that we have.  It is a vast Department.  The health system is by far the biggest provider of a service by the State to our citizens.  It affects all of us.  All of our families have been affected.

We try to focus on getting the Department in the best possible shape and focusing on the big policy challenge over recent years, which was the pandemic.

I am only a guest of the committee.  I thank the witnesses for being here and the opportunity to make a few points and put a few questions.<\/p> <p>  There is some history here but at the outset I say that I have the height of respect for the Secretary General, Mr. Watt.  We have a history of spats at the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees but if I were in the private sector and part of a company large enough to afford Mr. Watt, I would certainly want him on my board.  However, we are not in the private sector and that is where much of the difference is evident.  I am a democracy purist.  Once, at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, I raised the question of wastage of &euro;10 million because of an error by the Office of Public Works with the rent of the Department of Health.<\/p><p>It would cost &euro;10 million over the course of the lease.  My question was whether there was a disciplinary process afoot.  Mr. Watt was then in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  He said he did not know but that a \"gotcha\" culture did not operate in the Civil Service and these things were used as a learning experience.  I thought that was a very expensive learning experience.

How can Mr. Watt reconcile that with the idea of an open-ended term?  The CMO has very kindly pointed out he is a good distance from his 40 years.  Therefore, on top of proposing funding of &euro;2 million per year, Mr. Watt was in effect proposing that should the CMO opt to retire in the interim &mdash; say, after five or six years &mdash; he would, under the special clause in the superannuation Act, bump up the 27 or 28 years to 40.
