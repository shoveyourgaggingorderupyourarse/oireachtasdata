On behalf of the Irish Solar Energy Association I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on the topic of solar energy and the agriculture industry.  I am CEO of ISEA.  I am joined by Dr. Reale, head of business development UK and Ireland with Lightsource bp, and Mr. Connolly, commercial director with Activ8 Solar Energies.  ISEA was established in 2013.  Our mission is to decarbonise Ireland&rsquo;s electricity sector through supporting the development of solar in this country.  We are pleased to address the committee in respect of the tremendous potential of solar for society and the agricultural sector.<\/p> <p>  The climate action plan aims for renewable electricity delivering 80% of power needs by 2030.  Achieving this target will require a strong contribution from solar.  As the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communication, Deputy Eamon Ryan, noted recently, the plan&rsquo;s indicative target of up to 2.5 GW for solar energy should be a base line for our ambitions.  Given the right policy landscape, we believe Ireland can deliver 6 GW of solar between now and 2030.  That would be enough to meet one fifth of electricity needs.<\/p> <p>  This year is proving to a be a big one for solar in Ireland.  Just last week there was the milestone moment of the Millvale solar farm connecting to the national grid.  It is the first solar farm to do so, and further solar projects across the country will connect in the weeks and months ahead.  The microgeneration support scheme should come into effect in July and ISEA members report significant interest from individuals, communities, farms and businesses seeking to participate in the energy transition.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, to date, the climate conversation on agriculture has been fraught.  Solar provides a practical option to aid agriculture in its transition.  Making land available for solar developments presents opportunities for farmers to diversify their revenues with minimal impact on the sector.  Our estimate of the necessary solar contribution to meet Ireland&rsquo;s renewable target entails using the equivalent of approximately one fifth of 1% of agricultural land.  Buildings, such as sheds, on many farms can host panels and enable farms to move towards energy independence.  If one also considers the potential savings to the agrifood sector of farmers generating their own clean power, it suggests an immediate benefit to maximising solar.<\/p> <p>  We have the resource, land and building stock.  We have a sector motivated and interested in participating in solar.  Unfortunately, however, there are barriers inhibiting progress.  We believe there are three broad areas that require action, namely, support structures, taxation and network access.  The support structures require concerted action to maximise the take-up of solar by farmers.  In our view, the design of the TAMS II solar grant has been unduly restrictive and that has minimised take-up.  The microgeneration support scheme, announced in December 2021, now has a clear plan for homes to access its benefits.  However, the timeline for farmers remains unclear and that should be addressed.<\/p> <p>  A second barrier relates to an agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax rules that allows farming families to inherit agricultural land without being subjected to potentially unaffordable levels of inheritance tax.  Current rules allow farms with solar panels to qualify for the relief so long as the panels do not take up more than half of the total land area.  This stipulation is inadvertently preventing farmers from hosting solar panels.  Easing the restriction could have an immediate impact for farmers and the solar industry.  Solar installation does not prevent the use of the land for agriculturally relevant purposes such as sheep grazing.  Depending on the equipment layout, international experience suggests that 55% to 80% of the land under lease could be available for use, and that is before one considers use of the land under panels.<\/p> <p>  Accessing the network is another area of concern.  It can be a lengthy, uncertain and expensive process.  Ireland needs to rationalise that process for all users, from an individual farmer seeking to export from his or her rooftop to the utility-scale solar farm.  A helpful fix would be to ease the restrictive legislation in respect of so-called direct lines.  Direct lines provide direct connections from renewable energy sources such as solar farms to the customers, which are typically large-scale industrial users.  Direct lines could provide quicker routes for users to connect to renewable sources of energy.  That would allow large energy users such as agrifood facilities to satisfy much of their demand from green sources.<\/p> <p>  There are further simple actions that could make solar more attractive for everyone in society.  These include a reduction in VAT rates on solar panels and other solar equipment, and implementation of planning reforms for rooftop solar photovoltaic, PV.<\/p> <p>  We believe that Ireland will be a greener country by the end of the decade, providing its citizens and businesses with access to cheaper locally generated electricity.  We can meet our objectives, and solar is a necessary part of getting us there.  Agriculture will benefit from solar at scale and that requires the active participation of the agricultural sector.  I again thank the committee for its time.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall Bolger"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh gach uile dhuine.  It is great to have this session on what is and should be a really positive story for Irish energy generation, but also for Irish agriculture.  Frankly, it is shameful that we are hearing of difficulties in terms of farmers being able to participate in what should be a very positive story in the context of energy generation.  Many of the issues outlined by Mr. Bolger are not new; we have been hearing about them for the past decade.  To me, it is inexplicable that some of these blockages are still in place, especially considering we have a Government that is stating categorically that it considers these issues to be a priority.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  We can go over and back.  There has been much interest and many questions from members of the committee following the Millvale announcement last week.<\/p><p>Many people are asking pertinent questions about whether or not this is an option at which they would look.  Could Mr. Bolger give more detail about the size of the farm involved and the proportion of the farm that is now allocated to solar panels?  One of the things that interested people was the fact that the stocking rate, which involved a sheep farm, was only reduced by 25%.  Clearly, this is an opportunity for this particular farmer to continue farming while get an alternative income stream.<\/p><p> Could Mr. Bolger touch on what the model would be if a beef farmer decided to go down the same route?  How much of this farmer's land would have to be apportioned for such a project and would it be possible for the farmer to continue breeding cattle on any feasible basis?<\/p><p> The big question is whether this is a realistic route that more farmers would go down.  As Mr. Connolly will know coming from the good part of the country, as I would describe it, we in the north of the country might not have as many summer days as they do in Cork so is it a feasible option in all parts of the country in terms of the return that might be there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#B00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Starting with Millvale, as the Deputy rightly identified, the landowners are using the sheep essentially as vegetation management.

It tracks the hours in a day so you know when it is going to come on, peak and go away.  International experience shows that the level of error on the forecast is less than 1% so we know what is going to do.  Obviously, you get different seasons so in winter, the peak tends to be a bit lower and the days a bit shorter.  It is still producing power.  In summer, the days are longer and the peak is a bit higher.  We are the beneficiaries of our weather.  The wind and the solar resources are inversely correlated or to put it another way, the wind tends to blow when the sun does not shine and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  What that means is that when you layer those two together at scale, you start getting more hours of the day where green energy is coming.  We have a lot of wind.  What we really need to do is start scaling up our solar power to complement it.<br\/><br\/>Regarding what you find when you do that, Afree Management Consulting undertook to compile a report for us.  It found that the annual bill savings to customers would be &euro;106 million per annum in the 2030s spread across the Irish population.  Because it is coming on in the middle of the day and has that peaking shape, it is also knocking off some of the less efficient power stations.

That is a perfect example of a decent relatively small development on a 38 kV ESB network but if you are going up to 110 kV transmission network where there tends to be a bit more capacity, the projects need to be bigger just to afford the cost of the substation and the fixed costs of such a scheme.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on the other points the Deputy raised about the different types of farmers.  We speak to everybody - tillage, beef and dairy.  Some people just do not have the interest in it because they really enjoy farming and want to continue while others see it as a really good way of diversifying their income stream - even if it is for interest.  Some see it as a retirement option.  Many different kinds of farmers are interested in the solar option.  You cannot keep beef cattle on the same land simply because they are too big but you could keep some of the farm over.  Not everybody wants to give all their land over.  It is really sheep and small livestock that are suitable for grazing with panels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#C01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tara Reale"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>You hear about the most frustrating aspect of this when you talk to farmers who have had solar panels installed and who are by law precluded from providing electricity to the grid because TAMS is so ridiculous.

The level of take-up has been low because it is difficult to navigate the process, your allocation is not ring fenced from the other elements of your TAMS allowance so if you have undertaken other modernisation measures, you might not have quite the space left to go after the solar side of it and as the Deputy rightly pointed out, there are restrictions on export, which mean that people are essentially not allowed to spill on to the grid.

That figure was announced but was not ring-fenced for solar; it was contested with every other upgrade in TAMS.  We contested that within TAMS, that could have been segregated in the same way as the low emissions slurry spreading was segregated out with great success.  When it comes to solar, the most progressive farmers are those who want to jump on board but they are also those who have already capped out at the &euro;80,000 funding that came with TAMS in the first place.  That rapidly diminished our ability to roll it out.  More than 50% of that co-operative's suppliers of milk put their hand up looking for interest in the system we put forward in TAMS but in the end, only 10% of suppliers took up the system.

We have been engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for some time.  We have sent periodic letters and members of our association have engaged with it.  I understand the next step to be a set of interim regulations involving some easing around much of the country, with an exclusion zone around airports while they do some assessment, and a parallel strategic environmental assessment which is supposed to deliver the final regulations around this.  I have heard that the update in that regard is coming in next quarter pretty much since I started this job in January 2021.  I am reliably informed that many others have traipsed that road before me.  We struggle as an organisation to understand why it has taken so long because we understand a lot of the work has been done.  It has been under way for a long time.  I think the Deputy is right to frame it in terms of the impact on people.  At the domestic level, it is 12 sq. m or 50% of the roof area, which results in people putting in smaller systems than would be optimal in order to fit within the planning.  That is happening on firms around the country as well.  It is a 50 sq. m rule and it encourages people to go towards a smaller system than would be ideal.  That has an impact on people's energy bills, particularly given what we see in the energy markets today and what people are exposed to.  The wholesale cost of power is three or four times what it was this time last year.  Everyone's bills were raised by suppliers on three to five occasions last year.  We are not done yet and there are the knock-on effects of the horrible war in Ukraine.  There is an issue of human welfare, in some ways, with the delays in the planning.

I suspect they might come up again under other question areas.  On network access, there is a missing piece in terms of farmers looking to export from the farm.  A trial was put in place for mini-generation.  It would be where farms normally set land in terms of what they would like to export.  ESB Networks received 150 applications from people who fit the scale and it was closed immediately, pending a review by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and ESB Networks.  We think that is probably not a wise thing to do because it generated interest and provided a route to the network for many people but then the door closed.  That is a concern for the on-farm side.

We will probably circle back to that in later conversations.<\/p> <p>  As to when people will get paid, we understand that for those on the domestic side who are sub-6 kW, which is the standard size, payments are due to flow from 1 July with the option for credit going back to February, when the statutory instrument implementing it was signed.  For farms that are sub-6 kW, it is unclear.  It looks like it is quarter 3 or quarter 4.  There is a package of measures including grants and export payments and there is avoiding energy prices.  That is unclear, which is why I referenced it in my opening statement.  For the people who are a bit bigger than that, and here farmers are relevant again, we are still waiting for clarity on what it will look like.  Those people on the next step up get paid a clean export premium, so it is a slightly different rate.  However, those people are likely to be looking at TAMS support.  We cannot see how TAMS over here says you cannot export and people over there say you can get an export payment.  That area needs clarification.<\/p> <p>  On capital acquisitions tax, we support the characterisation that it is energy farming as much as farming traditional agricultural products.<\/p><p>We have engaged with the Department of Finance and we have been asked to provide more information.  I am not sure that we have done a good job convincing them just yet, but we are working hard on the topic.  We would encourage all representatives to take an interest in it.<\/p><p> On VAT rates, members are probably aware that there is a European Union directive which states that the VAT on panels can be reduced by between 0% and 5%.  If we are trying to encourage this roll-out and trying to help people, then we should make it a bit easier upfront and maybe shave a bit of the cost off in order that people can access it a bit more easily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall Bolger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

With the benefit of being able to diversify incomes in situations where we are looking at one in three farms being viable, we really think that this is quite a material issue.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Reale, who will talk about the impact she is seeing in her engagements with farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall Bolger"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>We are seeing this becoming more and more of a major issue.  If we look back to when the threshold was initially implemented, which, I believe, was 2017, we can see that the trend in Ireland followed that in the UK and Northern Ireland, where it was for these small, community-sized solar farms that generated 4 MW or 5 MW peak.  For such operations, probably a maximum of only 20, 30 or 40 acres of land was needed.  Then there could be a situation where one landowner could conceivably have 80 acres or where there could be two landowners who, between them, would not be impacted.  It could also be the case that there are a lot of sites.<\/p> <p>  We must consider how policy has now changed since then.  In order to get grid access, especially from EirGrid, a project must be large-scale in nature.  This is also in the context of the economics.  Members will appreciate that - as is the case with everything one buys - the more one buys, the cheaper per megawatt the actual cost.  This has driven developers towards these large-scale farms.  Then there is the whole process of finding grid and the need to take into account all of the other planning considerations, including those relating to visual impact, special areas of conservation, heritage issues and so forth.  In that context, you are quite limited in where you could conceivably put a solar farm.  If you speak to landowners, if they are interested - many of them are because of diversification of income, wanting to retire or the fact that their children are not interested in farming - if their neighbours are also willing to go in on the project, again, this is on the proviso that those neighbours have land that is appropriate from a topographical point of view, you are often in a situation where there are perhaps 150 acres or 160 acres of land.  This may seem like a very large amount of land.  It is, especially if it is a large farm or collection of farms, but it is not really sufficient in many instances.  It depends on how you are connecting into the grid.  We would have say to the farmer involved that there would be no point in us optioning the land because it would be highly likely that the project would never get off the ground because the economics would not work.  We would tell them that we would be doing them a disservice by having the land under option.  We have had to turn away a number of opportunities where people were extremely eager to get into solar energy because we just could not make the economics work.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of projects in development at present.  They are a bit more marginal, and we are happy to keep investing in them.  We have done some basic scenario analysis to see if we could take 50% of their land versus 60%, 70%, 80% and so on.  Based on one particular project, having a typical hurdle rate, bidding into an auction and having the benefit of 80% of someone's land versus 50% of the land, that translates to &euro;12.50 per megawatt hour of cost to the consumer in the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction, which is a sizeable amount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tara Reale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>In addition, Deputy Browne also asked why the condition is there.

Can the power that is generated on the top of the resource centre be redirected or has it always to go to the grid?  If there are enough panels on a roof, then you will generate more power than the resource centre actually needs.

In the long term we see the direct line option offering some structures for community-based energy solutions like the models that are being described.  The future of the power system is that every building in the country will generate its own power with large-scale utility solar and wind battery storage.  There will be large-scale offshore wind farms with hydrogen and so forth and all of those systems will talk to each other.

I can talk through what that looks like in a minute.  The remainder would be customer scale solar power, which is essentially solar panels on rooftops across the country.  We have work under way with MaREI, the research centre in University College Cork, to look at what the potential resources in Ireland are.  It is working to look at all the home rooftops in the country and how much they could generate.  Panels do not need to be put on a big percentage of buildings, including: schools; universities; various industrial and commercial settings; and homes across the country, before one starts getting to quite big numbers quickly.<\/p> <p>  On the utility scale, the Minister mentioned the RESS auctions.  Dr. Reale mentioned these auctions and in them the renewable projects compete to be guaranteed a price for 15 years.  If one models that forward in terms of the four that have been announced and if one assumes that solar will do anything like what it did in the first auction in terms of wind rate, a variety of scenarios will be run such as projects falling over and not being able to make it stack up at the end even after the auction.  One still gets to scenarios where one is easily at 4,000 to 5,000 based on what has been published by the Government on the programme of RESS auctions.  Even with a relatively conservative set of assumptions one can get there.  The key is that if all that solar power is layered in with all that wind power the number of hours in the day when we are generating clean power will be increased.  There is another benefit to all these projects under the RESS auctions.  The way the contract works is that if it is below a certain price the projects get topped up from the public service obligation, PSO, levy on customers' bills but if it is above that then the projects pay back.  The last RESS auction is &euro;73 per MW hour.  Around now it is about &euro;250 per MW hour in that market.

There has been a bit of discussion about the networks.  What do the witnesses believe has to happen?  They say that with the direct lines it is the simple deletion of section 37(1) of the Electricity Regulation Act.  Is it as simple to deal with the network connections?  What has to happen in order for those blockages to be freed up?<\/p> <p>  We have heard a lot from wind energy representatives at climate committee meetings about planning delays and the delays in getting a decision.  They are very keen to see the resourcing of the planning process, the environmental NGOs, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and so on in order that decisions are received much faster.  Is that an issue for today's witnesses as well?<\/p> <p>  My last question follows on from on-roof solar and the interim regulations we were promised, which would exclude the areas around the airport.

My colleague, Dr. Reale, highlighted Belfast International Airport, where you can see the panels from the planes when coming in.  Rotterdam The Hague Airport has just opened a 14 MW solar farm just by its runway.  Dublin Airport has just applied for planning permission for its own solar farm, so I am not sure how concerned it is about glint and glare in all that.  We think the approach is probably too conservative and does not reflect the good practice we have seen in other jurisdictions.  If the wind energy industry talks about planning as issue number one and grid as issue number two, we reverse the order - grid is issue number one for us and planning is issue number two.<\/p> <p>  We share concerns about the resourcing of the planning process.  In the mid-2010s, Ireland lost many planning experts as a result of the economic crash and the economic challenges it created.  To date, solar has been quite successful in the planning process.  The last statistics I saw showed that about 93% of planning applications for ground-mounted systems had been successful.  We want to update a set of planning guidelines that we developed in 2016 and 2017.  They were designed for planners with a view to showing what good development looks like and the good practices to ask for.  We hope to update those guidelines this year, probably this year going into next year, with the intent that the update reflects the issues planners face.<\/p><p>The fundamental issue is resourcing.  We are hopeful that if we provide them with some information, or with a resource on which they can draw, it will enable them to assess these applications a bit more.<\/p><p> Beyond resourcing, there is also the planning process and the delivery by local authorities.  Once these projects come out of planning, are financed and building has started, we start getting into issues such as road opening licences, as well as various other implementation challenges.  The local authorities are burdened with a lot.  They could probably do with some help in resourcing those processes.<\/p><p> I could probably talk for two days about what is needed for the network.  I will not labour that.  It is key that we get our plan right.  Our plan for rolling out the network is wrong.  It is out of date.  It is not consistent with Government policy.  When I talk about that plan, I am talking about a document called Shaping Our Electricity Future, which was produced by EirGrid during the recent climate conference on the path to 70% clean energy.  First, it did not capture the 80% renewable electricity target in the climate action plan.  Since then, we have seen analyses from a number of sources that suggest that it is not consistent with any sort of pathway on our carbon budgets.  I think they have been published just before this meeting.<\/p><p> It is not consistent with a pathway towards 80% clean energy.  This is because we have seen that although the demand will go up, the level of renewable generation does not go up at a rate that is consistent with that.  This means that our relative share of renewable generation could be decreasing, even though we are installing more capacity.  The plan targets 1 GW of onshore solar PV, yet the climate action plan sets 2.5 GW as an indicative target.  As I said in my opening statement, the Minister said that that should be a baseline.  We think that we can get to 5 GW of the utilities scale there.  Therefore, this plan is not in keeping with any of that.<\/p><p> Essentially, this is the plan that will determine whether they build the kind of infrastructure that is needed to connect all these projects.  Each project has its own connections, like, for example, an R road or an L road.  The local connections are the way to get there.  However, they all have to be aggregated up into something bigger.  That is the transmission network.  That is what EirGrid is responsible for managing.  That is also what is needed to take the power from all these individual renewable generators.  That highway is not currently being built or planned for appropriately to get us on the pathway towards the 80% target.  We understand that EirGrid is planning to update it this year.  However, that plan needs to be delivered with urgency and then the next steps need to be taken. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#G02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall Bolger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>They are talking about their plan.

The hearings of this committee are very positive, in particular this session with respect to energy, as well as in general.  This committee is forward looking in trying to find paths forward for agriculture.  In generating electricity, there is a clear path forward.  I welcome this session.  I welcome our guests today to educate and inform us on what the opportunities might be.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Bolger has made a clear point about the importance of the grid.  He says that grid connections are his primary concern, and planning is his second concern.  The wind industry might invert those priorities.  I would encourage all members of this committee, and indeed all members of the Oireachtas, to embrace the importance of grid development, because it is a huge challenge across the country.  I would like Mr. Bolger to comment on that.  We are not going to get to the 70% target, let alone to 80% target or beyond, unless we develop our grid.  We will need leadership from all of the parties in the Oireachtas.  This is not easy.  It is very hard actually.  We need our State players to do what needs to be done.  We also need our politicians to the right thing and to show leadership.  I am talking about big projects, such as the North-South interconnector.  We will not get to the 80% target unless we get the North-South interconnector up and running as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in Mr. Bolger&rsquo;s points on the direct lines, as well as about how we can through legislation enable the development of direct lines and the development of solar farms so that we can connect them directly with industry.  He briefly touched on the challenges posed by data centres.  It seems to me that with solar energy, if you build out the farms that Mr. Bolger says that are in the pipeline and that can be built, we will get more solar energy in the summertime.  The data centre industry would say that that is when their greatest electrical demand is.  It therefore looks as though there is a correlation there that can be explored.  I do not know if the Irish Solar Energy Association has entered into any talks with the data centre industry, because this is a topical issue.  This is in an area that we are very challenged by.  While we need data centres and we use them in all of our lives, they are a challenge to our system.  We have to decarbonise our system and they are very energy hungry.  Mr. Bolger might speak more about that if he could. <\/p> <p>  He says that we can build up to 6 GW of installed capacity.  However, 6 GW of solar and 6 GW of wind may not equate to the same amount of energy, because of the characteristics of the renewable resource.  What is the percentage of our energy mix that 6 GW could equate to?  That is an important number to have.  We are currently at 36% wind.  We want to get up to a figure of a high 60% or to 70% by 2030.  What can solar do for us there?  <\/p> <p>  I have a practical question around the solar farms.  The land can be used for grazing and for other forms of light agriculture as well.  How permanent is the infrastructure on the land?  Can it in the future be returned to food production and to agricultural use?  This is an important question and I think listeners will be interested in it.<\/p><p> We spoke about, and Mr. Bolger mentioned, the issue of capital acquisitions tax.  Has he anything more to say on that and how the 50% threshold is impacting the industry?  If Mr. Bolger thinks there is more to say on that, I would certainly like to hear it.  Am I correct in saying it is very much an issue for the Minister for Finance?  If this committee believes that, we should notify him of it.  I am sure members will agree it is something we should explore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#H00400","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  I will go back to the question regarding the delivery of infrastructure.  He mentioned the North-South interconnector being crucial for operating our electricity system.  That is true.  Every systems study we have ever seen states that.  I have been in the electricity industry for about 16 years now.  When I joined, we were told the North-South interconnector was coming and how it was going to enable us to manage this system.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of it, and there are two jurisdictions, which adds further complexity, and many affected communities on the route, it points to some of the challenges.  There have been other subsequent plans, such as Grid25, which was going to involve a great deal of grid development.  I do not think a cable of that has been laid although there might have been some minor upgrades.  There is something to be said for energy being fundamentally about infrastructure.  There is no getting away from that.  We want to enable people to directly participate themselves.  We spent a lot of time during this session talking about that and it is crucial.<\/p> <p>  We also need larger utility scale projects that will involve the building of infrastructure.  It is one of the reasons we emphasise in the plan that it is important we build the right infrastructure and do not overbuild, which some of the standards are encouraging at present.  They are forcing developers to build more cable and more infrastructure than they need to, which is not very efficient.  We encourage all Members to think about the level of support they could or could not give to a piece of infrastructure recognising, as with any development, it has to be done using good practice and plenty of community engagement.  Clearly, something has to be done.  It is the Achilles heel of our renewables programme and, ultimately, it is something we have to grapple with as a country.<\/p> <p>  The direct lines and the summer load correlation is not something I fully appreciated but it is a very interesting point.  If many of the data centres could get in solar complemented with a battery system and maybe some other system, and there are some models where they could perhaps look at doing something with an anaerobic digester, such as biogas and those kinds of interactions with agriculture, we start getting to a situation where the data centre industry can meet a lot of its demand using those kinds of models.  They could build that whole concept of the circular economy of outputs from agriculture becoming inputs to data centres and sustainability of energy.  There are some very exciting things there.<\/p> <p>  On whether we have had talks with the data centre industry, we have probably had some engagement with it.  It is fair to say that it is in a very interesting phase.  The Central Statistics Office has just published statistics indicating data centre electricity demand is now greater than that of rural electricity users so this is not a problem that is going away.  There is a real opportunity for us to show a little leadership and have the most sustainable data centres in the world.  It is something we can do, if we are prepared to grasp it and enable it.  If direct line is something that helps get us there, it seems a relatively straightforward fix in order to move us on.<\/p> <p>  On the 6 GW solar question, we estimate that will be approximately 20% of our total power demand in 2030.  When we start layering the average wind profile, it is very interesting that the hours of the day when wind and solar tend to generate are different.  If we put the two of them together, we start getting to the point where we are getting closer and closer to 100% renewables.  Our challenge then becomes, in essence, how to manage the periods where we do not have enough and the periods where we have too much.  That builds into the need for a flexibility strategy for Ireland, including demand response, storage, batteries and, in the longer term, pieces such as hydrogen and so forth.  It is about that integrated system.  That is how we will get to the full decarbonised system.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over the question on land use for other purposes, but I note a scheme is in place to recycle the solar equipment at the end of its life, and a common part of the planning permission for those projects is they have to put money aside to restore the land to the situation-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conall Bolger"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>What is the lifespan of the panels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#J00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>It is 25 to 30 years.

Mr. Bolger is correct that the process for the interconnector was initiated 20 years ago.  The difficulty has been that there has been no public consultation in two decades since.  Twenty years ago, a <i>fait accompli<\/i>was presented to communities that opposed the plans and we have had 20 years during which those communities have been lectured to without any alternative being provided.  There are similar interconnectors.  There is an interconnector between Belgium and Germany, the Aachen Li&egrave;ge Electricity Grid Overlay, or ALEGrO, interconnector.  It is similar in make-up.  While there are always differences, ALEGrO and the North-South interconnector are very similar.  There was a parallel process.  A proposal for an overhead 400 kV interconnector power line met community resistance but two different courses of action were taken.  Belgium and Germany went the course of public acceptance and engagement and came to a decision to underground the interconnector.  That is nearly completed.  In Ireland, we adopted the pig-headed approach where we are essentially at a point where the real delays have not happened yet.  The real delays will happen when EirGrid or its agents attempt to walk on to the land of people who say they are not entitled to do so.  I agree that we need the North-South interconnector but I also agree that we need to bring communities with us if we are to deliver these types of projects.

Teagasc as an organisation is fully committed to embracing solar energy on its research facilities, including research farms, as well as on its advisory and education facilities.  This commitment is enshrined in the Teagasc statement of strategy, specifically strategic goal No. 5, which aims \"to constantly improve organisational excellence and efficiency\".  Deployment of a number of major solar photovoltaic installations, or PV for short, has already been carried out within Teagasc as part of its energy action plan, including the installation of a 250 kWp system on the Moorepark pig research facility, along with several smaller systems on advisory buildings and research farms.<\/p> <p>  On a national level, the Food Vision 2030 report sets the goal to develop a climate neutral agrifood system, so that by 2050 the climate impact of methane is reduced to zero and remaining agricultural emissions are balanced by removals; scale up renewable energy sources, especially anaerobic digestion, biorefining and biomass supply and solar PV; focus on energy efficiency; and examine potential barriers to the roll-out of renewable energy at farm level, including necessary support for microgeneration and access to the grid.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, the Ag Climatise report sets specific targets for energy use in agriculture in the nearer term, whereby a reduction in energy use by 20%, along with an additional target of meeting 20% of agricultural energy use by renewables, should be achieved by 2030.  These goals are, in turn, adopted into the Food Vision 2030 report as interim goals.<\/p> <p>  We have considerable ground to cover between now and 2030 to achieve these targets, given that less than 2% of dairy farms currently have a solar PV system installed.  Teagasc has been very active in the area of energy in agriculture for many years and launched its first dedicated publication on energy use in agriculture in 2011.  Furthermore, Teagasc has compiled a suite of fact sheets on energy use and renewable energy generation covering all farm enterprises, which were updated recently.<\/p> <p>  Teagasc has also dedicated considerable research resources to dairy energy efficiency.  An active energy research programme at Teagasc Moorepark is evaluating the impacts of deploying microgeneration and minigeneration solar PV systems on dairy farms.  This research is built on a foundation of energy auditing and modelling that has been ongoing for more than ten years.  Teagasc has developed a very high level of understanding of energy consumption trends, energy costs and associated electricity-related carbon emissions of the dairy sector through this work.  This has been disseminated extensively through webinars, the Dairy Farm Infrastructure Workbook, the Dairy Farm Infrastructure Handbook and Teagasc open days as well as farm walks.  Teagasc is seeking to expand its research capabilities in this area through building capabilities in the Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, VistaMilk 2 research centre, which is funded by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to include an energy research cluster.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, Teagasc has partnered with Munster Technological University and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to deliver an online dairy energy optimisation platform to help farmers reduce their energy use and maximise solar energy use.  The optimisation platform automatically identifies the best blend of energy efficient and renewable technologies, based on either economic or environmental criteria, on a farm-specific basis.  The user is also provided with a simple payback period and carbon emissions offset resulting from the technology upgrade.  This tool can also advise farmers on microscale solar PV sizing while providing carbon offsets and payback times for such investments.  Teagasc has always encouraged an \"efficiency first\" approach to farm energy since renewable energy is not \"free energy\" as it comes with considerable upfront costs.  Therefore, farm businesses should always be assessed for opportunities to improve efficiency before evaluating renewable options.  This approach is also promoted in the Ag Climatise and Food Vision 2030 reports.<\/p> <p>  Opportunities for deployment of solar PV systems that are economically beneficial for farmers have been greatest where a significant part of the energy generated is consumed on the farm, for example, on dairy, pigs, poultry and horticulture, thereby offsetting expensive grid supplied electricity charges.  In the absence of substantial on-farm demand for electricity or a significant export tariff, the payback periods can easily exceed ten years, resulting in low levels of interest in solar PV systems on some farms.<\/p> <p>  The only viable option for deploying solar PV for dairy farmers has been to follow the self-consumption microgeneration route as there has been an absence of an export tariff for electricity exported to the national grid.  Additionally, planning permission is required for PV arrays in excess of 50 m&sup2;.  These aspects have limited the appetite for the installation of larger systems among farmers.<\/p> <p>  A typical solar PV installation on a 100-cow dairy farm comprises the installation of an 11 kWp solar PV array on the dairy shed roof - this size does<\/p> <p>not require planning - which involves an investment of approximately &euro;15,300.  This size system will supply 30% of the farm's electricity needs from renewables and will pay for itself in around seven years at current electricity prices and without grant aid.  This size system would offset 3 tonnes of CO2 per annum.<\/p> <p>  Going forward, with recent announcements on the advent of a microgeneration and minigeneration solar PV export tariff and potential easing of planning requirements in the near future, there should be renewed interest among farmers in adopting solar PV by allowing for up to 50 kWp systems on farms.  However, some anomalies may remain in place, such as the inability of farmers to avail of the export tariff if they utilise their Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, grant to part-fund their solar PV system.  These anomalies can create confusion among farmers and may inhibit mass levels of adoption.<\/p> <p>  The opportunities for solar deployment on farms are great, given that shed roofs are the ideal home for such systems and there is no shortage of space for these systems on a typical farm.  Similarly, dairy farms that operate spring calving systems produce the majority of their milk during the summer months, and hence consume the most electricity during the months of highest solar electricity generation.<\/p> <p>  Development of solar energy generation in agriculture has the potential to have three major benefits for Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture industry.  First, enhanced energy security through the displacement of fossil fuels will bolster our national energy self-reliance through the consumption of locally generated renewable electricity in place of electricity generated from imported fossil fuels.  For example, a conservative estimate of 200 GWh of electricity could be generated by dairy farms if they were to meet 50% of their electricity demand from renewable sources.  The second benefit is related to farm diversification.  Income generated from exporting excess electricity will provide additional income streams for farm families in rural Ireland and encourage parallel income streams from the farm.  Third, renewable electricity generation is better for the environment and generation of electricity on farms will help contribute to our national efforts in the area.  The potential of high levels of adoption of solar PV on dairy farms alone could save over 100,000 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year nationally if every dairy farmer installed 26 kWp of solar panels.<\/p> <p>  A prerequisite to the successful deployment of solar energy in agriculture is that it should be profitable and equitable across all farm types and stages of development, regardless of farming system deployed.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this information and I welcome any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Upton"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Upton and Dr. Shalloo to the committee and thank them.

The question is whether agriculture can be climate-neutral by 2050 and what role energy will play in that.  Looking at the overall emissions of a dairy farm, for example, energy plays a pretty small role in that.  In the carbon footprint only about 1.5% comes from energy, that is, electricity.  To become climate neutral by 2050 there is a massive job to be done but there are other things that will have to form part of that, for example, how methane is treated in the calculations.  Its lifetime will have to be part of the calculations to become climate neutral.  I do not think anyone argues with the science around that.  Methane is one part of it.  Obviously, there will have to be significant reductions in nitrous oxide through changing fertiliser type from calcium ammonium nitrate, or CAN, based fertilisers to urea-based fertilisers and protected urea fertilisers, for example.  That will form a second part.  The third part, which will be hugely important, is the removals.  Getting appropriate emission factors for the removals in terms of sequestration on mineral soils and losses through peat soils will form the third pillar in how climate-neutral looks for agriculture by 2050.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#M01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laurence Shalloo"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Dr. Shalloo accepts that is a highly ambitious target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#M01500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>It is highly ambitious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022050400002#M01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laurence Shalloo"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>It is an honourable one, however.

I thank the Chair for facilitating this legislation quite quickly and for his work on the pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  I apologise for the slight delay at the start of the meeting.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the Sick Leave Bill 2022 with the committee today.  It will ensure that for the first time in Ireland all employees will have a statutory entitlement to paid sick leave if they are unable to work due to illness or injury.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic exposed the vulnerable position of many people, especially in the private sector, when it comes to missing work due to illness.  Our view, which I think is shared by the majority of the committee, is that workers should not feel they have to go to work when sick because they will lose all of their income otherwise.  It is not just bad for them, it is bad for public health, as sick workers might infect colleagues, clients and customers and be more likely to make a mistake, injure themselves or do harm to others as well.<\/p> <p>  As a starting point, this scheme will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for illness benefit from the State kicks in.  As we know, illness benefit can last up to two years.  Where an employee has an extended period of illness, this scheme will operate seamlessly with the existing illness benefit scheme and system.  Once employees have exhausted their entitlement to paid sick leave from their employers, they will move on to illness benefit paid by the State, provided they have made adequate PRSI contributions.<\/p> <p>  The length of coverage will increase over time and eventually provide for an entitlement to ten working days or two weeks annually in the fourth year of the scheme's operation.<\/p><p> Events of the last two years have shown how necessary this legislation is.  While it represents a new expense for some businesses, and we understand the pressure that will put on them, it is common across Europe that employers cover a portion of sick leave costs.  We have taken care to ensure that costs are not excessive.  That is why there is a four-year lead-in period with this legislation.<\/p><p> Some have said that they think the Bill goes too far, and others argue that it does not go far enough.  We believe, in general, that we have got the balance right with the legislation we are proposing here.<\/p><p> Ultimately this Bill means that workers will not have to attend work while sick through economic necessity.  This will be one of the positive legacies to emerge from the pandemic.  While Deputies might differ on the approach, we are all agreed that this legislation is the right thing to do and the sooner we can implement it, the better.<\/p><p> I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill at the earlier Stage and I look forward to our discussion here this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#A00700","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>A number of amendments tabled on Committee Stage have, unfortunately, been ruled out of order.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 9 in the name of Deputy O'Reilly form a composite proposal which would allow employees to self-certify for sick leave instead of being required to provide a medical certificate.  We will come to all of these as we go through the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 7, in the name of Deputy Paul Murphy, would require a medical certificate only after the tenth day of sick leave.  Amendment No. 8, in the name of Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, would only require a medical certificate after three consecutive days of illness.  These amendments would create a statutory entitlement to sick leave pay for public servants above and beyond what is currently the case under regulations.  This would potentially lead to greater costs for the Exchequer arising from sick leave payments.<\/p> <p>  Sick leave remuneration for public servants is determined by way of ministerial regulations made under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The current regulations under the Act are the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations 2014, Sl 124 of 2014.  Under those regulations, public service employees must provide a medical certificate to qualify for sick pay, except where a local employer decides to waive that requirement.  In accordance with Standing Order 212(3), the amendments must be ruled out of order as they have the potential to impose a charge on the revenue.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 25 and 27, in the name of Deputy Paul Murphy, would remove the 20-week cap on the amount of remuneration that may be awarded by the Labour Court.  This exposes the Exchequer to higher costs in the event of a public sector employee winning a case.  In accordance with Standing Order 212(3), the amendments must be ruled out of order as they have the potential to impose a charge on the revenue.<\/p> <p>  The remaining amendments will be considered at today's meeting.

What we are trying to achieve here is that, as a starting point, this scheme will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for illness benefit kicks in, and that can kick-in for two years thereafter.  I want the members to bear that in mind as we have this discussion.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has been very clear on the medium-term plan to make sure employers know what their obligations will be.  The statutory entitlement to sick pay will be phased in as part of a four-year plan and will initially be three days a year once the Bill is enacted and commenced.  This will effectively fill the gap in coverage, as I said, caused by illness benefit waiting days.  It is important that we close that gap at the outset.  Closing the gap of current waiting days before being able to access illness benefit will help reduce the numbers of sick employees presenting for work.<\/p> <p>  This four-year plan takes account of the current economic climate and the existing financial pressures on businesses.  We must bear in mind what businesses have been through for the past couple of years with Covid and what is now happening in relation to the war in Ukraine.  The latter is putting extreme pressure on businesses.  We want to get the balance right here with this legislation but it is also important that we try to protect those jobs that are there and give businesses a change to adjust to this scheme over a couple of years as it is being implemented.  The number of days will increase incrementally, with the goal that employers will eventually cover the cost of ten sick days per year from year four.<\/p><p> We fully understand many businesses are struggling with additional costs because of the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit, our coming out of Covid and the disruption these have brought.  That is why we have chosen to phase in the new right.  While we all agree it is important to introduce this right, there has to be a balanced approach to it.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 16 would provide that the number of paid sick leave days could not be reduced below ten by any ministerial order.  As statutory sick leave will be introduced at three days per year, this amendment would not align with the timeline of the scheme proposed.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 17 would not restrict the number of days by which statutory sick leave could increase in any given year.  Subsection (2)(b)(ii) currently stipulates that the Minister may not increase the number of sick leave days by more than three in any 12-month period.  This provides certainty to employers by ensuring that unexpectedly large increases in the number of sick leave days will not be introduced.  This is a sensible approach that allows businesses to plan ahead and anticipate the potential cost increases, which are significant for many, certainly for SMEs.<\/p><p> Similarly, providing the Minister with the ability to increase the number of sick leave days by ten days, as per amendment No. 18, under any one order would be disproportionate and unfair to employers.  Such a dramatic increase in coverage could have unintended negative consequences, with employers unable to afford the associated costs.  Again, we have to bear in mind that it jeopardises jobs if we force too many costs on employers.  We are trying to get the balance right.  I ask the members to try to understand our approach and that there will be incremental growth over a four-year period.  This, we believe, is balanced and fair, and recognises the circumstances we are in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#B01900","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Where did three days come from?  Why is it three rather than two, four or five?  How did the Minister of State come up with three?  We are being asked to agree to three days because it is to increase to ten.  We are being reassured that this will happen but the Bill does not provide such reassurance.  Stitched into it is a wide-open loophole that means the current or another Government may well decide not to increase the number.  The factors the Minister must have regard to in section 6(1) in deciding whether to increase the number include the state of the economy generally, the business environment, national competitiveness, the potential for any disproportionate or adverse effect on the economy generally, specific sectors of the economy, and employers and employees.  The Minister must also have regard to the views of employer representative bodies.  I would bet quite a large amount of money that the view of the employer representative bodies on increasing the number of sick-pay days will be that we should not be increasing it because the employers do not want to pay for it.<\/p> <p>  Even if we get to ten days, does the Minister of State not accept that we would still be far behind what is normal in many countries in Europe?  In Austria, for example, workers are entitled to between ten and 16 weeks.  It deals in weeks, not days, on 100% pay.  In the Netherlands, people can get sick pay for up to two years.

The legislation is designed to facilitate whatever Minister sits in this chair in the years ahead.  We need to bear in mind that the number today is zero and that we are asking businesses and employers to adapt to a new statutory sick pay scheme, which they are paying for.  It is only right and fair that we introduce it over a period of time.  It is about the management of businesses.  Some would say it is not about management, but we are trying to get the balance right.  The measure does not favour any one sector or social partner over another; it is about achieving a balance that protects jobs, will continue to grow jobs and enable businesses to continue while recognising the benefits for everybody of having a statutory sick pay scheme.  It is a matter of introducing it at a pace that is manageable.<\/p> <p>  What is proposed compares quite well with the arrangements in many European countries.  The number of days varies from country to country.  The majority have around ten days or fewer.  Australia, New Zealand and Canada all have the ten days.  The commitment by the Cabinet, as expressed by the T&aacute;naiste in D&aacute;il debates and discussions here, is to go to ten days over four years.  The legislation does not cap that.  There is no ambition capped either.  There is flexibility for future Ministers to go beyond ten days if they so choose.  In the legislation, we are asking that the Minister reflect on the circumstances in the country on any given day.  The Minister must consult not only employers but also all social partners.  This was expressly requested by this committee.  It is written into the Bill.<\/p> <p>  The reason the measure was suggested for regulation, not legislation, is that this is the best way to adapt to any situation as a country.  The members have been discussing here for nearly a year the permits legislation that I am trying to adapt and make changes to.  Since the provisions are expressed in primary legislation rather than regulations, it is very hard for us to work with them and make any changes needed or recommended by most people here.  If the provisions are in regulations, the Minister can adjust and make changes much more quickly on behalf of the country at the right time to reflect current conditions.  That is why we are not over-prescribing in primary legislation.  Primary legislation does not always work to the benefit of everybody.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the three days, following the discussion in the very early stages of this in the D&aacute;il a commitment was made by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, to introduce this legislation.  Thereafter, there was consultation across all the Departments and among all the social partners.  Members of this committee and many others went through all this.  We fixed on an entitlement of three days to begin with to close the initial gap associated with the illness benefit because nobody gets anything for the first three days as matters stand.  That was the most important gap that the T&aacute;naiste wanted to close.  The aim was to build on that thereafter.  That is why we introduced the three days, as well as consultation with everybody.<\/p> <p>  It is proposed to have three days, moving to ten days within four years.  We believe this is a fair and reasonable request of employers.  Members should bear in mind that employers are paying for this.  That must be understood and accepted.  Future Ministers can decide to make changes to the proposal if they want, but this is what we are recommending at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I hope members will understand that our job in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is to get the balance right to protect workers at work, prevent the unnecessary spread of illness, encourage people to stay at home when unwell, try to cover the cost of their staying at home, and recognise that employers of all sizes have to implement this scheme as a statutory sick pay scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#C00500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I, like other members I am sure, want to see a sick pay scheme implemented.  The Minister of State pointed out that employers are paying for this, which is the truth of it.  In some of the preamble to the Bill he tried to give credence to the difficulty out there and he mentioned the social partnership.  I wish to raise two matters.  One is something I asked before and raised in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions which is why Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, is not part of this leave Bill.  I do not believe small businesses are being properly represented as part of the social partnership agenda.<\/p> <p>  Further, employers will be quite willing to look at expanded sick pay schemes but the problem is that they are paying for it.  One of the things this Bill does not address is any support for small or micro-enterprises which may have to take on people to fill a role while an employee is sick, which happens quite a good deal in many industries.<\/p> <p>  On the last occasion I asked that the Minister of State might look at tabling an amendment to provide a tax rebate, or something like that, for this double whammy where a small business has to put up the resources for the scheme and then has to pay, possibly through an agency, to find support and help.  These employers are getting no support for that.  The larger employers, as we know, already have sick pay schemes in place because they can afford them.  The problem here is that we are trying to legislate for everybody but, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, this is going to have an effect on employers.  We cannot have the idea of having unlimited sick days but we want to start with something fair.<\/p> <p>  This is where I would be coming from.  I ask the Minister of State to consider tabling an amendment on some type of tax rebate scheme, which may be one of the easiest things to do, to take account of small and micro-enterprises which are going to be significantly impacted, particularly as this scheme is extended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#D00100","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his work on this Bill to date.

We are very much an enterprise committee here and there is an onus on us to help cultivate and generate enterprise across the country.  Several small business owners I have spoken to would see this scheme as a possible deterrent to them taking on staff in the future.  There has to be scope to look at the possibility of a rebate scheme where employers can avoid a double whammy.  This has been raised with us by many representative groups and small business owners who will have to pay the sick pay and, in the case of a business that perhaps only employs three or four people and is public-facing, will have to bring in a person in to cover that work for the day.  They will face a double whammy.  Some engagement with Revenue should be possible so that we can come up with a rebate scheme that ensures those businesses are not penalised.  Even with the smallest of businesses, which may not have the most sophisticated risk matrix, they will operate that risk matrix but within their own heads and will see this as a high-risk scenario.

We are trying to strike a balance and everybody recognises that workers need a right to sick pay and that traditionally this was provided only by the State and the employer did not play any role and that was not fair or balanced.  The difficulty with the proposal, and I can understand how others can say that sick pay should be extended, is that the reality is that the State takes on the responsibility after a certain period of time and sustains pay but in many workplaces, of course, there are much better terms than the State arrangement alone.  We are trying, therefore, to provide a safety net for people who are not in those more generous schemes in order to balance that against the reality that other Deputies referred to, which is that there are many small businesses with a small number of employees who are customer-facing and do not have the sorts of options to substitute and to cover which larger employers who are not in the customer-facing business have.   This means that they have to get somebody in when somebody is out sick.  There is this balance to be struck and I am unsure as to how it is to be resolved.<\/p> <p>  At a minimum, I would hope the Minister of State would commit to having a review done after a reasonably short period to see how this is impacting on those smaller employers, with the possibility of some form of relief for them other than the long-stop one which is in the Bill of proving inability to pay.  That is a fairly draconian system in order to establish that level of proof.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is quite correct in that we are trying to strike a balance.  Employers have a responsibility here but we have to try design that responsibility in a way that does not unfairly impact on certain types of employer.  There is scope to try to explore that further before Report Stage, if the Minister of State can do so, or at least by way of a review at a very early date to address the fears of excessive burdens being placed on some of these labour-intensive customer-facing roles and the need for some relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#D00400","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>A number of issues have been raised.  I share the concerns raised by the previous speakers.  To address Deputy Bruton, I have committed to a number of employers that we will track and review this to see if we are putting jobs in jeopardy or are placing an excessive a cost on businesses.  The T&aacute;naiste is very clear that we will phase this in in order to give such businesses time to adapt and to cope with it.  It could potentially increase the payroll bill by 0.8% to 1% in some cases, which may put extreme pressure on businesses, certainly from a cash point of view if one has to replace customer-facing roles.  We will monitor this and will continue to address the concerns of Deputies Shanahan, Flaherty, Duffy and Bruton, and others who are concerned about engaging with the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, community as we track and watch this as it is rolled out.  We will then seek to find ways to support, where possible, these businesses.<\/p> <p>  Rebates are not very proportionate and have not worked very well in the past when it came to other redundancy schemes, and so on.  All of us want to ensure we do not jeopardise any jobs or businesses.  There is, as had been referred to by Deputy Bruton, in section 10 an inability to pay provision but that may come too late for some businesses or is a hard bar to reach.  It has not been used, as far as I am aware, in the minimum wage legislation.  We will track this and try to find other ways to support the SME community, if needs be, through our business development agencies, such as our local enterprise organisation, LEO, network or Enterprise Ireland.  We are trying to find ways to provide support, if needs be.  We will monitor this but such a provision does not belong in legislation.  What is important here is that we introduce a statutory sick pay scheme and that we track that aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  This is similar to the provision where the Minister of the day may adjust and make recommendations every 12 months to increase this.  The effect on the economy at that time will be tracked, not just for employers but also for employees in terms of cost of living and so on.  That will be monitored to get the balance right, which I stress here.<\/p> <p>  We recognise this is not the ideal time to bring in this legislation given what has happened over the past number of years with Covid-19 and Ukraine.  We recognise also, however, that we are an outlier in Europe by not having a statutory sick pay scheme.  It is important we bring one in and the commitment was made on the floor of the D&aacute;il that we would do that.  We must ensure we do so in a manner in which businesses can cope with it.<\/p> <p>  There is a commitment to keep PRSI as low as we possibly can for employers, given with the effect that this could have on employees.  This scheme may limit the need to increase PRSI on employers, so there may be an offset of cost there.  That is something that we will track and keep an eye on as well.<\/p> <p>  I have talked to many in the SME community and I have met many businesses, as has the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, over perhaps the past year to 18 months and have discussed the legislation with them.<\/p><p>We have been trying to encourage them to work with us on this scheme and to recognise the importance of protecting their employees and ensuring that employees do not feel that they have to go to work.  Everyone would benefit from that - other staff, customers and clients.  Many members of the business community throughout the country tell us that they cannot get staff and access the skills they need.  Many of those are customer-facing roles.  If we can strengthen overall terms and conditions, we believe it will assist in competing for talent.<\/p><p> In the European context, we are out of sync by not having a statutory sick pay scheme.  We are constantly striving to get the balance right between protecting employees and protecting employers.  The Government's response in recent years has shown that we are on the side of job creators as well as employees, in light of our supports during Covid, which were of equal benefit to both.  We are introducing this legislation in that spirit and in a balanced manner, with an implementation phase of four years committed to by the Cabinet.  I hope members will accept that we are doing our best to get the balance right.  We recognise that it puts pressure on SMEs.  Larger companies can probably absorb these costs.  It is fair to say that many employers already have their own sick pay schemes.  While many others do not have formal schemes, they operate some schemes, look after their staff well and facilitate them when they are sick or have other commitments.  There is a balance.  This Bill puts a formal scheme in place, but many employers already operate within this space well, and we should recognise that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#D00500","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I do not wish to prolong the debate unnecessarily because we have work to do.

This is an important issue.  Workers should be entitled to sick pay from the moment they start work.  The consequence of the requirement for 13 continuous weeks is the exclusion of many vulnerable workers.  It will discriminate and disproportionately affect women, to a significant degree.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has written to the T&aacute;naiste pointing out that it: &quot;<font color=\"#333333\">will leave hundreds of thousands of mostly women and foreign-born essential workers employed in low-pay jobs, who routinely have their service broken by their employer, without coverage for three months each year.&quot;  <\/font>That happens all the time in childcare, for example, where workers, 98% of whom are female, are let go over the summer period and rehired in September.  It will also massively and disproportionately affect young workers, more than a third of whom are on temporary contracts and will not be covered for the first 13 weeks.  The basic point is that you are not any less likely to get sick when you are on a temporary contract or in an industry where you are laid off over the summer because your employer breaks your service.  It is not your fault and there is no reason you should not be entitled to 100% sick pay from day one at work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#F00800","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>As has been outlined, the requirement for continuous service will, in effect, leave hundreds of thousands of workers outside the scheme.

It is a tactic of employers to lay off workers to keep them on their toes, and there is no point saying that it is not.  I am not referring to all or most employers, but some are doing it.  The need for continuous service means one is continuously having to build service.<\/p> <p>  I am not hostile to the notion of a service requirement.  It is done in other legislation but this effectively puts people, specifically women, workers on low incomes and foreign-born workers, as outlined by ICTU, outside of the scheme when they need the scheme more than anyone.  There are likely to be working for small employers rather than multinational corporations so are likely to be working in a place without an in-house sick pay scheme.

The one thing there was consensus on was that it is hard to justify saying a person's rights to sick pay should start some period into employment with a new employer.  Sickness can strike anyone at any time, as we have seen during Covid.  It does not seem to me to have a foundation to say the right should be deferred for a period.  Probation is not about sickness; it is about reliability and other things.  If someone is sick and has produced a medical certificate to show that, I do not see how not offering it from the first day is justifiable.

Most people will accept a relationship has to develop between an employer and employee before the employer is required or asked to pay for illness-related absences.

Let us say a worker signs his or her first contract at the start of 2000 and qualifies after 13 weeks, then experiences a period of being laid off, then signs another contract at the start of 2001 and has a another 13-week period, that means that worker will have needed a 26-week period to qualify when another worker would only have a 13-week period, assuming that we stick with the latter period.  If there is a service requirement, then it cannot be doubled only for the person who finds himself or herself in the precarious situation of having rolling contracts.

The explanation the Minister of State gave is that the employee does not have a relationship with his or her employer at that stage.  If one is a worker and a boss asks for something to be done in work, the worker cannot say to him or her that there is no work relationship yet.  It is a contract, one must work, one is being paid, one is treated as a worker and one has all the responsibilities of a worker who has been in employment for more than 13 weeks but for some reason, we are arbitrarily saying this worker does not get the rights that go with his or her employment in terms of sick pay.<\/p> <p>  The commitment is welcome in terms of the issue the Minister of State is dealing with as it is a large part of the problem.

It is important to recognise that a relationship of some sort of employment would be necessary before these entitlements would kick in and we suggest 13 weeks.

Deputy Murphy identified some of the issues with this section.  The section is very heavily weighted in favour of the employer rather than the worker, which is problematic.  Let us start with the premise that sick pay is an important tool in protecting public health and that no worker should consider going to work if he or she is sick.  The intention is to increase the entitlement but it is a little bit like the right that an employer has to say no to remote working.  There are many reasons there will be no increase but there is not an awful lot in it to suggest that other interests, such as those that would be in favour of workers, would also be considered.  When the Minister, or whoever it is, considers increasing the number or how that will be phased in, someone will always find an excuse not to do so.  The current wording is very heavily balanced in favour of employers.<\/p><p>There is no consideration for society or the well-being of employees, which need to be factored in.  That is in my amendment, that is, that the Minister of State would consider, \"the state of society generally, the public interest and employee wellbeing\".

I do not know of many workers who want to go to work if they are sick.  If this Bill is to serve the interests of both parties, as well as to balance the interests of both, then an amendment to this section is required.  I do not think that it delivers.  It gives too many excuses.  That is not to say that future Ministers will be looking for excuses but if they were to do so, this is already laid out for them in the legislation.  I would have a concern that this needs to be strengthened and bolstered to work for the interests of the workers, as well as for business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#G01900","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I am sympathetic to Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment.

To be very clear, if we wanted an excuse not to do this, there were plenty of excuses in the last 24 months and in terms of what is to be ahead of us in the next six or seven months.  The T&aacute;naiste still is determined to bring this legislation through the D&aacute;il because he is committed to this and believes it is the right thing to do for the country.  To say anybody would want an excuse is wrong because we are here today bringing forward legislation that is weighted and balanced in favour employees, employers and public health.  I would not be recommending the legislation to the members if I did not think it was weighted and balanced correctly.  It is not heavily weighted in favour of anybody.<\/p><p>We should also recognise that the employer is paying for this, and not anybody else.  That should be borne in mind.  The legislation is weighted fairly across the board.<\/p><p>It is a progressive Bill and it will ensure that all employees will have financial protection from day one of a medically certified absence.  However, the Government does not want to jeopardise jobs by placing an unsustainable cost and administrative burden on business.  That is why this is to be phased in over a period of time.  The introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme must be balanced with the need to support the viability of the business and enterprise sector, thereby protecting the jobs that we all dearly cherish in this country.  It is entirely logical that the Minister would have regard to the state of the Irish economy, of the business environment and of national competitiveness before adjusting the number of paid sick leave days provided for under this Bill.  To do otherwise would be reckless and it could lead to unintended negative consequences.<\/p><p>In recent times, as Deputy Bruton just said, we have witnessed a series of unprecedented and unforeseen events that have had significant impacts on the global and Irish economy, including Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  These events are by their very nature unplanned.  Their impacts may be more widely felt by specific sectors of the economy.  It is only reasonable that the Minister of the day would take account of any economic shocks when adjusting the number of paid sick leave days that employers are required to cover.  There is no sense in adjusting the number of sick leave days to a level that is unsustainable for businesses and that would lead to a loss of jobs.  Nobody would win in that situation and nobody would want that.  This is about what is fair and right for employees and for employers.<\/p><p>Certain sectors, particularly the retail, hospitality and caring sectors, may be more impacted by sick-related absences than others.  We touched on this earlier on.  From a cash point of view, employers would have to replace a worker in a customer service role immediately as they would not be able to absorb the work in other ways.  These sectors may have the additional cost, when an employee is absent through illness, of paying for an immediate replacement.  Ireland's body of employment rights protects all employees equally and we have always avoided the creation of subcategories of rights by sector.  That is why we spoke earlier about business supports being handled in other ways through our business development agencies, and not in legislation that gives rights to workers.  This is the correct way to do things.  Rights should be universal and not by category when it comes to this situation.  Yet, the corollary is that sectors which bear greater costs in respect of certain rights should be taken into consideration when new entitlements are being introduced.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 11, these matters are already covered under subsection (1), which provides that the Minister may consider, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the state of the economy, the impact on employers and employees, the views of trade unions and any other matters the Minister deems relevant.  This provides flexibility and allows the Minister to consider all relevant issues, in addition to those that are specifically mentioned under the Bill.  Subsection (1)(e) was introduced in response to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the sick leave Bill, which recommended that the legislation should provide for consultation with the social partners in relation to the implementation of its provisions.  Hence, we have made that change.  We took this recommendation on board and we included this requirement in section 6.  We have taken a collaborative approach in developing this legislation and we wish to ensure that is fair to both employers and employees.  We believe that this is the right approach, and we will continue to engage with both employer and employee representative bodies going forward.  It would be unfair to consult only with trade unions, which amendment No. 13 would provide for.<\/p><p>The effects of inflation and the cost of living for employees are not particularly relevant matters when considering the number of sick leave days provided for under the Bill, although they are relevant right across the board at Government level.  These issues would be more relevant when considering the minimum and maximum rates of payment.  That is naturally something that we will deal with in the regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#H00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I have two quick points.  The first is that while everyone can say the word &ldquo;balance&rdquo;, but this is not some neutral thing.  The balance goes one way or the other.  I do not hide that I am trying to shift the balance in favour of workers, relatively speaking, against employers.  To be clear, I think there should be compensation for small businesses.  I am unashamed about that.  There is not some abstract, floating-in-the-air, perfect balance that can exist.  There is the question of weighing up which ones we think are more important here.  In this situation, we think that what is presented is not enough for workers and that the interests of employers have too much weight, in terms of what the Minister will take into consideration.<\/p> <p>  My second point is a general one.  It must have been said ten times now that it is the employer who is going to pay for this but where do people think the employer gets the money from?  Who creates the wealth the employer will use to pay for the sick pay?  All of the money comes from the worker at the end of the day.  Where is the profit coming from that the sick pay is going to be paid out of?  It is coming from the employee.  There is this idea that the employer is just taking money from their personal wealth or elsewhere to pay the sick pay.  This is a slight increase in wages and the worker is getting back slightly more of the value they are producing.  However, they are still not getting the full value, which is why the employer will still make a profit.  That is why I reject the idea that this is not ultimately coming from the employee as opposed to the employer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#H00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I want to reject that as well.  It is constantly being said that the employer is paying.  We could equally say that they have not been paying for decades and that they have been getting away with it for decades.  It does not need to be referenced in that way.  For this to work, we must not come at it from the perspective of this being some kind of gift that is being bestowed on workers.  Rather, it is an instrument of public health.  I am worker, just like everyone else in this place.  I do not want people coming into work if they are sick or to feel an obligation to come into work if they are sick.  That has to be the starting point.  There is this constant reference to the fact the employer is going to paying.  There is, absolutely, but they have been getting away with it for years.<\/p> <p>  We need to come at this from a public health intervention perspective, which is what it is.  I believe this is where this Bill has come from.  When listening to members of the Government when they speak about this, they speak about the need for us to regard sick pay as a public health intervention.  This is not an optional extra.  This is not a gift that is to be given to workers.  Nobody wants to be sick or to be off on sick leave.  However, they want the comfort of knowing that they will not end up in the poorhouse just because they are sick.  Equally, their co-workers want the comfort of knowing that nobody is going to be dragging themselves into work and infecting everybody else because they will have this safety net.<\/p> <p>  If we come at it from the perspective of it being in the public interest and public good, then I see no reason amendment No. 11 should not be accepted.  It would tilt the balance back in favour of the worker because that is who need to look after in this instance.<\/p> <p>  In regard to employers who cannot pay, the Minister of State knows as well as I do that there is the same provision in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 for employers to go to Labour Court.  The very same employers who said that it would put them out of business and all of that are not going to the Labour Court.  Therefore, maybe businesses are a little bit more resilient to absorbing these costs than we give them credit for or, indeed, than they sometimes give themselves credit for.<\/p><p>However, this is very much in the public interest and we should be coming at it from that perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#H00500","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I support what Deputies O'Reilly and Paul Murphy said.

Those are genuine considerations.  Economies must not refuse to recognise that competitiveness is part of being successful and that enterprising people are needed.  Getting profits from one's enterprise is not some sort of error; it is what allows an enterprise to be successful, export, win new business and create wealth for everyone to share.<\/p> <p>  The question of balance the Minister of State is trying to defend is absolutely authentic.  Ireland has the history to prove it.  We went through long years when we failed to recognise the importance of enterprise of competitiveness, and we paid dearly for it.  We have succeeded over several decades, despite the financial collapse, in building a balanced economy that can provide opportunities to introduce legislation like this and do other things that we could not do for years.  People have to be conscious that having a provision that implies the competitiveness of our businesses and economic climate is important in deciding what new obligations we impose or rights we create is just sensible.

I said at meetings of this committee before that I have a slight problem at times with some of the narration on employers.  I believe it was Deputy Paul Murphy who said it is the employees who are creating all the wealth.  Employers have to put the structures together for productivity to happen.  There is a balance to be struck.  I am certainly on the side of employees but we must remember what Deputy Bruton just alluded to: one has to be cognisant of what is going on in the economy.  We are trying to do something now that we have not done before, namely, introduce a statutory sick-pay scheme for all workers.  I welcome that but do not subscribe to the idea that we can just ramp up year on year without being cognisant of what is happening in the economy and the headwinds that businesses are facing.<\/p> <p>  To return to a point I made earlier, small and medium enterprises, which employ close to a million people in this country, are not being properly spoken for here.  As public sector workers who get our increments, it is very easy for us to go into the D&aacute;il and vote further expenditure into the pot to pay for the costs.  That does not happen in the private sector; in the private sector, one has to try to create a business margin wherever possible.  When margins are affected by increased costs, it is very difficult to combat.  When the Government says one must take on increased costs again that will impinge upon margins, we have to be mindful that it is a competitiveness issue.  We have built very efficient companies in this country because we are agile; however, when the public sector and public policy require new machinations for businesses that will add to their costs, it is a concern for them.  We have to be mindful of that.  Therefore, I believe that what is in the legislation, which is that the Minister must have regard to all the headwinds affecting competition and cannot just have a statutory increase of two, three or four days year on year, represents sound business and fiscal policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#J00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I have a couple of observations and comments.  We are not opposing Deputy O'Reilly's amendment but saying it is covered by the existing wording.  She will recognise that herself.  We have made changes on foot of this committee's recommendations before.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy wants to exclude employer representative bodies.  He is asking for the provision in this regard to be deleted.  I could not condone that; that would be illogical.  We are trying to bring forward legislation that is balanced.  The Deputy said he is a champion of the employee and takes credit for that, but our job in government is to strike a balance and ensure there are jobs for employees.  It is a two-way approach. <\/p> <p>  I do not apologise for acknowledging that employers will have to absorb the cost.  It is a public health measure.  It will protect everybody and gives sick workers the option to stay at home rather than going to work because they cannot afford not to.  That is what the legislation is being introduced for.  Employers do not pay for such a scheme at present but they will be paying for it.  We have to recognise that, and I do not apologise for doing so.<\/p> <p>  We all agree that it is appropriate to introduce a statutory sick-pay scheme.  Most employers I talk to acknowledge and accept that, as mentioned by Deputies Shanahan and Bruton, but they recognise they are trying to run businesses with massive costs and that have seen cost increases over the past couple of years.  Employers accept these schemes if they are fair, reasonable and manageable and if the cost can be absorbed over time.  We are trying to introduce the scheme over several years to allow employers time to adapt and, in some cases, change prices.  However, they have to remain competitive.  I sat with Deputy Bruton across the road back in 2011 and 2012 when we had an unemployment rate of 16% or 17%.  Everybody you spoke to wanted a job.  Of course we all want jobs with good terms and conditions, and we are constantly striving to have improvements in this regard, but we also want employers to create those jobs, take the risk, have the ambition to go further and take on international markets.  However, they have to be competitive to do that.<\/p> <p>  Profit levels vary from business to business; there is no doubt about that.  Some employers make great profits while others just barely cover their costs and pay their own wages.  We have to recognise that.  This legislation will apply across the board for all employers.  For a small shop on the corner employing 20 people, this legislation could add a cost of &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 per year.  We have to bear that in mind.  Prices may be passed on, profits may be reduced, and affected businesses may become less competitive.  There is a combination.  We are trying to introduce legislation that is balanced for everybody and introduces good pay and conditions and a statutory sick pay scheme that is needed and recognised.  We are an outlier in Europe &ndash; no one is denying that &ndash; but it is a matter of bringing in the scheme in a phased way that is manageable for everybody and does not jeopardise well-fought-for jobs.  Everybody here, across all Departments, has worked to create an environment that is conducive to job creation.  We must recognise that at the end of the day, the cost proposed is an additional one and that it will be imposed in a few months when we finish this work.  We must also recognise that the majority of employers want to do the right thing by their staff.  In the majority of cases, they do that and accommodate sick pay schemes or other informal arrangements at their own expense.  However, the Bill proposes a statutory scheme that will have to be implemented across every place of employment.  The balance is right.

I recognise the mechanisms.  If one uses the clause that is there under exemption, there are the consequences.  To respond to Deputy Paul Murphy, it is not to say that businesses cannot have their profits reduced.  It is that the business is not sustainable if it pays this out, and would not survive and it would put jobs at risk.  Nobody here wants to risk the jobs.  We all want to increase the number of jobs.  It is great that this country has had a jobs-led recovery.  Of course, we want good terms and conditions and to constantly improve that as much as we possibly can, but not to put jobs at risk.<\/p> <p>  This is a statutory pay scheme.  It is about rights across all sectors.  Business supports and supports to different businesses are dealt with elsewhere, but we will try to capture what Deputy Flaherty and others are asking on Report Stage in order to recognise that too.  However, it is built into the reform mechanism.<\/p> <p>  In terms of supports, such as job supports, we do not deal with them in statutory rights legislation.  However, I accept what Deputy Flaherty is asking me and I will try to deal with it more on Report Stage.  It is ongoing work we do through the local enterprise offices, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and many other organisations supporting jobs.  Even with Pathways to Work through the Department of Social Protection, we encourage and work with employers to give people a chance to work and to retrain, etc., across many Departments.  They are job supports in many other ways.  I will track that.<\/p> <p>  As I said, we recognise that some businesses will feel under pressure to absorb these costs over the next couple of years and that is why we are trying to get the balance right here.  That is why the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, has led on this and that over a four-year period, not straightaway, we will increase it up to ten days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#K00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:  \t&quot;(b) the state of society generally, the public interest and employee wellbeing;&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#K00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, lines 14 and 15, to delete &quot;the economy generally, specific sectors of the economy, employers or&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#K00700","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 13:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, line 20, to delete &quot;employer representative bodies and&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#K00900","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, to delete line 21 and substitute the following:  \t&quot;(f) the effects of inflation on the cost of living for employees.&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#K01100","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651618800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, line 22, to delete &quot;The order first&quot; and substitute &quot;An order&quot;. <\/blockquote> <p>This is an amendment to ensure that the number of sick days, as it is changed as it goes on, can only be increased as opposed to decreased on the basis of developments.

We need to recognise that is often the SMEs that we are in here trying to support and that we talk about every day who need additional supports.

I ask that he please do that exercise and consider whether that would be an attractive option.  \"Attractive\" is the wrong word, but he should ask if there would be too many barriers in place.  If he does the maths he would see that the money that will be taken out, particularly to pay for the visit to the GP.  And we are talking about people who maybe do not go to the GP when they need to because money is a factor.  You are asking them to take that money out of a reduced take-home pay, in effect.  The Minister of State might think about that in the absence of availability of free GP care.  He cited all the European rates.  I understand that it varies, but the other supports available in those countries also vary except where it comes to access to free GP care.  We are very much an outlier in that regard.  I respect the fact that it is an aspiration of the Government to bring it in at some point but it is not here now.<\/p> <p>  I ask again, therefore, that between now and Report Stage that the Minister of State does those simple maths and has a think about the matter.  This does act as a barrier.  All of us acknowledge that for this to work as a public health tool, it has to be as accessible as possible.  I do not think that it is specifically for those workers on low incomes with those two things coming together, that is, the 70% income and the necessity of paying a GP.  It places a burden on the worker.  I will say it again: no one wants to work in a place where people feel that they have to come in when they are sick.  That is not the intention behind this Bill.  In order for it to work, it has to work for all workers including those on low incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#M00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I agree that it has to work for all workers.  It is particularly targeted at those in the lower-paid sectors where, according to research, there are no sick pay schemes.  All that was borne in mind when we set the 70% rate and the &euro;110 maximum.  We did take all that on board.  We tried to go as far as we thought was reasonable in order to protect jobs.  We recognise that this will increase the cost base of employers as well.  I know what the Deputy is saying.  Some of the countries I mentioned have different health mechanisms but, equally, the very lowest-paid and part-time workers in this country are more likely to have medical and GP visit cards.  It is necessary to go further to improve that, but it is outside the scope of this Bill.  It is a public health matter for the Department of Health, but there are commitments from the Government.  Others can make commitments to the same level if they wish and back it up with finance.  We have made our commitments and will continue to deliver on it.  It is important that we do that.<\/p> <p>  This legislation recognises that as of today there is no statutory sick pay scheme and those people are extremely vulnerable today because they get no income support for one, two and three days.  This Bill will change all that.  They will get support.  I accept that it is set at 70% and capped at &euro;110 a day but we think that is a major improvement and removes a lot of barriers that are there today and discourage people from staying at home when they are sick.  It is a major improvement.  People can come in here and argue both sides.  They might argue that we are going too far or that we are not going not far enough.  We believe that at 70% it is a major improvement and gives the majority of workers a reasonable level of financial compensation for the days that they are sick.  Today, in the early days of sick leave - days one, two and three - workers gets no compensation whatever and they are not discouraged from going to work.  That was very evident during Covid.  It goes back to balance.  I totally accept that the Deputy is genuinely making the case.  I know that, but we have to get the balance right in order that we do not jeopardise jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#M00500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>We absolutely accept that this Bill will improve things.  It should not be left unsaid that this is a welcome move by the Government.  We are working constructively to try to improve it.  However, it is a hell of a thing to worry about getting sick if you are in a low-paid job and you are genuinely terrified that you might be unwell because you cannot afford to be unwell and therefore you might hide that sickness and go to work because you cannot afford a dip in the wages or the costs that you would accrue for attending a GP.  It is a hell of a thing to be that worried, looking at your children or at your bills and knowing that you just cannot afford to get sick.  That is why we are bringing forward these amendments.  Our fear is that this may be an underutilised provision because people just do not feel that it protects them enough so they go to work sick, hiding their sickness, pretending that they are okay, coughing in secret, telling people they are fine if they are asked, because the protections that are being brought in for them will just not work.  Over a period, we may find, through the Department's analysis, that it did not work for the people that it needs to work for most.  Those are the low paid, vulnerable workers in insecure work often exploited, who are disproportionately women, migrant workers and young people.  We should, therefore, be trying to eliminate the fear in a household or a that person.  That is why we put forward these amendments.  I absolutely appreciate that employers have fears about their businesses but we live in a country with a low-pay epidemic and one which does not provide basic healthcare in terms of free GP care that other countries just take for granted.  That is why we feel so strongly about these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022050400002#M00600","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":373,"content":"<p>We had a discussion on the accessibility or otherwise of the proposals.

This means that here is a significant cohort of workers involved.  I again ask that the Minister of State do the maths, put himself in that position and consider whether he would be able to take the hit.<\/p><p> The purpose of this is to ensure that people have the comfort and security of not going to work when they are sick.  For a person on low income, it is the two things together - the 70% plus the GP care.  My amendment, although it was ruled out of order, would have delayed the need for the medical certificate until universal access to GP care is available to all workers.  If people are on low income and they are hourly paid, the chances are they will be looking for all the overtime that is going in order to supplement that.  It is only 70% of the basic, although I accept that is entirely the norm in other states as well.  However, the countries that the Minister of State is comparing us with also have GP access.  It is the combination of the two things together.<\/p><p> I do not believe it is intended to put unnecessary barriers in people's way.  This is definitely welcome.  The provision of statutory sick pay is important, but it is also important that it applies to all workers.

On Report Stage, the Minister of State will have an opportunity to consider something different and along the lines of what Deputy O'Reilly is proposing.

As with every discussion we have here, we will reflect on it, we will talk to the T&aacute;naiste and to our officials and we will work through this.  However, a lot of work has been done to achieve that target of 70%.  I did not say it is the norm across Europe to have 70%.  In many cases, it is a lot less and goes down as far as 25%, although I accept it is higher in some cases.  I am not saying that the norm is 70%.  We are above the norm or above the average.  We have put forward a reasonable proposal.<\/p> <p>  It is set out in regulation, for the reasons I laid out at the start.

As a Government, we understand both the barriers that are out there and the necessity for this.  That is why we are proposing it and bringing it forward, with the support of the Deputies.  We are in tune with what is happening out there as well.  We think we have the balance right on this, and we will monitor the position in that regard.  It goes back to the balance and the costs that we put on employers because they also have to be able to balance their books and to survive.  We want to have as many jobs as possible.  We want people who are on low pay to be able to constantly aim to get a job, improve their job and build on their terms and conditions, if that is what they want to do, in order to be able to pay their bills and look after their families.  They should not have that fear that I know is out there, which is &ldquo;If one of us gets sick tomorrow or next week, how do we manage and how do we pay the bills?&rdquo;  That is why it is important to have good-quality, well-paying jobs with good terms and conditions.  For that to happen, we have to have a balanced enterprise environment to manage that and to create those jobs in the first place.<\/p> <p>  It is a chicken-and-egg situation, but we will check and monitor this.  It is in regulation that the Minister of the day can adjust this through regulation, as opposed to having to go back to primary legislation.

It is linked to the average wage.  We think we have the balance right.  As I said, naturally, we will at every stage review what we are doing and keep an eye on that.

In terms of the balance of risk and reward for an employer not abiding by this legislation and not providing the sick pay required, and the employee having to go through all of the steps to prove that and then get a judgment, a penalty of two weeks' remuneration is extremely minimal.  The danger is that some employers, though not all, let us be clear, will decide that is a risk worth taking.  Even if they get caught out, it will only be a penalty of two weeks' remuneration.  That is very small, and I do not think it is in line with the idea of balance.  Surely there needs to be a considerable penalty to discourage attempts to evade or not implement this legislation, and not give workers the sick pay rights that we are talking about.

Doing so takes a long time.  If people are doing it on their own and they are not in a union, it is very arduous.  Given there is a cap at the end, someone's boss might say it is worth the risk.

The stability programme update, SPU, report was published in April by the Department of Finance and it sets out current economic and fiscal outlook, Ireland's medium-term strategy and emerging economic risks.  This committee has recently undertaken its own pre-SPU scrutiny and welcomes the opportunity to engage with the Minister on these matters.  I invite him now to make an opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#A00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here to discuss and present the stability programme update to it.  This document sets out the Government's macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts out to 2025.  It was published in draft form on 13 April and in accordance with our legal requirements, the final version was submitted to European authorities on 29 April.  I stress that forecasts outlined in the SPU are produced on a purely technical basis, reflecting existing Government policies, but they allow for the inclusion of new expenditure to provide for the resettling of refugees from Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  Policy formulation will take place over the summer months, with the summer economic statement setting out the broad economic and fiscal parameters for the budget.  As well as the summer economic statement, we will also have the national economic dialogue in June and the tax strategy group meeting, both of which will facilitate a constructive discussion amongst a range of stakeholders on the key socioeconomic issues facing our country.  All of this will feed into preparation of the budget next October.<\/p> <p>  At the start of the year, we took a very significant step forward with the removal of Covid-related restrictions and, for the briefest of moments, it seemed the Irish economy and other economies were starting to return to a degree of normality.  Shortly afterwards, however, this outlook was upended, as a deeply serious new crisis arose with Russia's unlawful and immoral invasion of Ukraine.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is, first and foremost, a humanitarian crisis.  Along with the unjust loss of life, millions of people have been forced to flee their homeland; over 5.3 million people have left Ukraine at this point, with a further 7.7 million displaced within the country.  We firmly recognise this humanitarian crisis but I hope the committee understands that the document and forecasts being discussed this evening focus on the economic consequences of what is a humanitarian crisis in the first instance.  We look at the economic effects of this war and the further effects due to the economic and financial sanctions that have been put in place.  All of this represents a very large supply-side shock to the global economy but it is fair to say the European Union is at the coalface of this change.<\/p> <p>  The impact from the war in Ukraine represents the most immediate risk to our economy but we cannot lose sight of the other challenges on the horizon, particularly the ongoing threat that Brexit poses.  The UK Government's decision to postpone the further implementation of import controls means that the full impact of Brexit will not be evident immediately.  This will not, however, lessen the impact on the Irish economy over time.<\/p> <p>  The economic consequences of the war in Ukraine are rippling out across the global economy.  According to the latest International Monetary Fund, IMF, forecasts, the war in Ukraine is expected to wipe close to 1 percentage point off global growth this year.  Ireland&rsquo;s direct trade links with both Russia and Ukraine are very small but we are nevertheless highly exposed to the indirect effect arising from the conflict and we are already seeing the fallout from the war.  This is perhaps most evident in consumer price inflation, which has risen sharply, reaching a many-decade high of 7.3% in April.  My Department expects inflation to peak in the second quarter before easing slightly over the rest of the year.  We, along with others, anticipate a significant easing in inflation growth next year, with the headline rate projected to average 3% for 2023.<\/p> <p>  Taking all of this into account, my Department has incorporated a 2.25 percentage point reduction in its growth forecast since the time of the budget.  We are now projecting modified domestic demand growth this year of 4.25%.  These projections are based on current market expectations regarding oil and gas prices and, as members will be aware, prices can fluctuate, both upwards and downwards.<\/p> <p>  The Government recognises the real hardship rising prices create for households across this country.<\/p><p>We responded swiftly to provide support where we can with a wide range of tax and expenditure measures worth more than &euro;2 billion.  On top of the &euro;1 billion in measures announced in budget 2022, there have been three further cost-of-living packages.  These includes the latest measures agreed recently at Cabinet, which are an additional three weeks payment of the fuel allowance, a temporary reduction in VAT on gas and electricity, the scrapping of the public service obligation levy which is placed on energy bills and an extension of the reduction in excise duty to mid-October, as announced last month.  Ultimately, however, the causes of current inflationary pressures are not within our control.  There is a limit to what the Government can do to offset rising energy costs.  We can absolutely help to share the burden, but we cannot absorb it in its entirety.<\/p><p> On a positive note, employment growth surprised on the upside, increasing by more than we expected through the past year or so.  The number in employment is now at its highest level - 2.4 million people - ever.  The rapid recovery in the jobs market is due in no small part to the various measures the Government put in place to support workers during the pandemic, most notably the employment wage subsidy scheme.  These measures helped to maintain the employer-employee link that is so important.  With the pandemic, it is hoped, now running out of road, we are now in the final phase of exiting from that emergency support scheme.<\/p><p> Overall, allowing for all these factors, my Department is now forecasting a general government deficit of &euro;1.9 billion for the year.  We will have run deficits of &euro;30 billion overall since the start of 2020.  We have an expenditure ceiling in place of &euro;85.6 billion for 2023, providing for a 5% in core or non-Covid expenditure next year.  An additional contingency fund of &euro;3 billion is in place for next year to address the humanitarian consequences of the Ukrainian conflict.  Combining all these elements, we are currently forecasting a marginal surplus next year of 0.5% of national income, or approximately &euro;1 billion. These figures come with a massive caveat, however.  There is a very high level of uncertainty in respect of the situation in Ukraine,how it might evolve in the coming months and how it could impact on the public finances.<\/p><p> In addition, it is essential to make the point that public debt still remains high, at just over &euro;235 billion this year, and is a source of vulnerability that must be managed carefully.  I also stress that borrowing costs are now on a rising trajectory.  The interest rate on ten-year debt for the country has increased by one percentage point in just two months.  The rate of interest on recent Government debt exceeded 1.6% on each of the past three days, for example.  Overall, it is clear that the era of quantitative easing is coming to an end.  The period of extraordinary support that was put in place by central banks across the world during Covid is now concluding.  The era in which Governments were, in essence, paid to allow other financial markets' companies to accept their debt is now coming to an end.  We need to recognise that and plan for it in the period ahead.  The key point is that this will highlight and underline the importance of managing our public finances in a careful way. <\/p><p> The committee will agree that the Irish people have shown great resilience during the pandemic.  Unfortunately, yet again we will have to display resilience in the face of new challenges.  I emphasise that the Government will continue to work to minimise the fallout for those who have the least as we deal with the challenge of rising prices, for example, and what that means for the standard of living.  It must be re-emphasised that we will do that in an environment where the only money we have is that which we collect in taxes and that which we borrow to use now and repay in future.  As always, the resources the Government has are limited.  We will share and we will do all we can to help with the challenge that many are facing at the moment but we cannot entirely insulate the economy, businesses or even households from the change that is taking place.  With that in mind, I look forward to a fruitful and constructive exchange of views on the economic and budgetary outlook.  I will take into account the views of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#A00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  As the Chairman outlined, the committee has been considering this issue.  The Parliamentary Budget Office delivered an excellent and interesting briefing.  As the Minister outlined, we are and have been living in extraordinary times, with Covid and now the invasion of Ukraine.  Of course, that means it can be difficult to predict what may be coming down the tracks.  My questions largely relate to the view of the Minister in respect of some of those issues.  Obviously, some of it is difficult to predict but I am interested to tease it out and hear his views.<\/p> <p>  The forecast in the stability programme update assumes that sanctions will remain as they were at the time of publication.  Obviously, those sanctions do not include energy products.  There is a scenario analysis, but it does not include fiscal-side analysis.  I understand that things are constantly changing.  It can be very difficult to analyse what might happen as a result.  Of course, all present are aware of the recent remarks of Ursula von der Leyen in the context of oil and sanctions.  There has been much discussion regarding sanctions.  What impact could that have?

What we have attempted to do is to capture some of these scenarios in chapter 6 of the stability programme update.  As she correctly stated, it is incredibly difficult to model how the war will develop and what could be the policy decisions that are taken by the rest of the world in response.  However, I believed that to publish an economic forecast for Ireland that did not acknowledge this uncertainty but tried to give figures in this regard would be an incomplete piece of work to offer to the Oireachtas and the European Commission.  What we have done in chapter 6 is give our best judgment in this regard.  We have tried to model what will be the effect in our economy if we see a movement in oil by a further 50% and a movement in the price of gas by a further 75% across 2022 and 2023.  In terms of the impact that would have on the economy overall, from a fiscal point of view, our analysis is that, at a bare minimum, it would wipe out in its entirety the moderate surplus we have projected for next year.  From an inflation point of view, we expect to see an increase for the year in which the further shock may happen of approximately two further points of inflation growth.  We expect the impact that would have on the growth performance of the economy would be a further one to two points in terms of the medium-term growth performance of the economy.<\/p><p>The forecast is for there to be two points in inflation, the surplus to go in its entirety and an impact on our growth of somewhere between one and two points but I emphasise to Deputy Farrell that there is a great deal of uncertainty around that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#B00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Of course, that is the difficulty at present.

We are still expecting consumption growth, albeit at a slower pace.<\/p> <p>  To deal with Deputy Farrell's question on the SME impact and what that will look like, the reason we put in place such an extraordinary set of economy supports is to give every chance to every enterprise that was viable before the pandemic hit to still be viable and to be able to trade successfully when the pandemic and the effect of the pandemic had moderated within our economy.  It is incredibly difficult to form a forecast regarding what will be the impact on the viability of SMEs later on in the year as our economic supports finally go in a few weeks' time because of all of the other change happening our economy at the same time.  We expect to go back to a normal level of insolvency, which has been suppressed for a while, but what we have done is twofold.  We have, first, run the supports for longer than many would have expected and, second, as Deputy Farrell will be aware, the Minister of State in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, has brought in two changes to insolvency and examinership procedures to help smaller companies to have a better chance to emerge from a period of economic and financial difficulty, for which that Department legislated at the end of last year.<\/p> <p>  It is encouraging to see the CSO figures that came out today stating that 84% of firms have come through the pandemic and are trading viably.  What we will do as we approach the budget, because at that point we will have had a number of months in which the supports have not been in place, is to try to give a clearer view at that point regarding what is the impact on the viability of SMEs due to the withdrawal of the supports.  I am hopeful that it will be a low impact because of how long we have run the supports but, obviously, I cannot guarantee that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#C00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I am not sure how much time I have left.

The reason we have not changed them is that I currently do not have a reason to do so.  We will see in the next few weeks or, at most, months what agreement is reached in the European Union regarding the implementation of the minimum effective tax directive and by the summer we will know the status of the other pillar in the OECD work on the reallocation of taxing rights.  It is only when we are clear on where we are with the directive and on whether the other piece of work will be delivered next year that there will be a reason to change the corporation tax forecast for 2023.

If one looks at where we are now with the stability programme update, we are in the early days, I hope, of the Covid pandemic not being the health threat that it has been for the past two years.  We have more people working in Ireland than we have ever had previously.  We have public finances that, for this year, are projecting a deficit of less than 1% of our national income or, in cash terms, &euro;2 billion.  The recovery of our economy, of our jobs and our public finances from the pandemic has been remarkable.  A significant contributor to that has been the strength of the economic supports that we had in place, their duration and their design.

If we are able to avoid some of the further economic risks and difficulties this report outlines and says could happen - we try to say what impact that could have on our growth - it is still possible that for this year and next year, we will see more people working than we have before and we will have public finances that will improve and give us the ability to make some progress on all of the other issues our country wants to see progress on.  One of the key drivers of that is the strength in employment and the ability for the number of people at work to still grow this year and next year.  It is very positive to have that in place but we cannot take it for granted and certainly as we approach the budget we will look at what measures and choices we must make from a budgetary point of view that will help us continue that jobs-led recovery into 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#C00900","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I have one other question.  I happened to go on a tour across the centre of the country to the western seaboard over Easter.  I was amazed at the heavy vehicular traffic on the road in both directions.  It would appear manufacturing and exporting is growing and holding its own.  How can we facilitate that?  For instance, there is a dearth of heavy truck drivers at the present time.  There is a necessity to clear the way for them.  There are people available to join the industry.  We need to try to clear the way.  I am aware the Minister is not directly responsible but other Departments are and can facilitate the expeditious delivery of produce all over and outside the country.  We need more drivers.  We need more operatives in the construction sector and we need them urgently.  Every week we delay now will contribute to making it more difficult to achieve the targets the Minister has set out.  I agree they are a great example of how to run the economy in difficult times and at the same time keep the majority of people at work or at least available to come back to work.<\/p> <p>  The last point is there a dearth of a number of products worldwide at present, with microchips being one example.  We, therefore, need to give whatever assistance we can in the form of whatever it is they need now to improve their operating conditions to ensure those in this country can meet the challenges ahead in the best way possible.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the Minister on having achieved so much in very difficult circumstances.  It would have been easy to throw in the towel and say we will do the best we can but we will await the outcome.  The Government did very well.  Everybody pulled their weight and made sure the maximum assistance was available to employers and employees to the greatest extent possible in order to keep the country turning over.  It is a matter for the county to take up the cudgels on its own behalf with a view to utilising every possible resource available to meet the challenges ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#D00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  We all just tried to play our part during what was an awfully challenging and difficult two years.  I remember being in this committee and releasing previous stability programme updates at a time in which we had more than 600,000 on the employment wage subsidy scheme.  I vividly remember many of the moments over the last two years in which we were so concerned regarding the viability and future of tens of thousands of employers.<\/p> <p>  We are facing a whole new set of challenges.  I am conscious they are causing such real difficulty and stress to so many at the moment but we are facing into those challenges in the context of the policies we have put in place for the last two years to help employers get through the pandemic.  Those policies worked.  We are now facing into the next set of challenges with 2.5 million people working in the economy and a deficit that is far smaller than we could have expected a year ago.  We must use both of those to our advantage in the time ahead.<\/p> <p>  On the point on how we can get more truck drivers in place, there are two aspects.  The first is visas and the second is the work being led by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on apprenticeship and retraining programmes.  That is what we have got to do.  For those who want to come into our country to work, we must facilitate them in doing that.  For those who want to change work or acquire new skills, the work the Minister is doing in apprenticeships and trying to support people going into new roles is essential, long overdue and he is delivering it.

It is so important we get this opportunity to hear his views and opinions and to ask the questions that are arising.  We are very thankful to him for the time in his busy schedule.<\/p> <p>  Of all the times in our history, none of us in our worst nightmares, nor he on becoming a Minister, would have imagined he would be a Minister at a time when there is a war of the kind taking place in Ukraine at the moment and the difficulties and challenges that is presenting to all of Europe.  I am of course grateful for the hand of friendship that is being given and the safe homes that are being made available to the people who have to come here and to other parts of Europe as well.  My one concern about that is there being no cap.  It is not that I would not welcome any number but that I worry we might find ourselves in a situation where we will be bringing in so many that we will not be able to take care of their housing, educational or health needs.  When I speak of concerns around the figures, those are the concerns I have.  Obviously, we want to try to do everything we possibly can in this humanitarian crisis.  However, as I said, I do not want a situation where people will find themselves in places that are not suitable.  We want to do right by the people we are bringing here.  I hope I am explaining myself properly.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the sanctions, it is not so much about the implications of the sanctions we in Europe are placing on Russian but the sanctions that could ultimately be placed on us.  I mean the effect on fuel and energy costs.  We are so reliant on other sources for our energy and have such a low energy supply ourselves.  I am thinking of the effect that will have on families, small businesses and our day-to-day living.  Enormous challenges are being faced due to the massive inflation increases.  The basic amount it takes to live now makes it extremely difficult for people on low and medium incomes.  When I am talking about that I must mention what was already said about workers and the availability of them.<\/p><p> There is an awful problem in Ireland.  It could be in the hospitality sector, where there is a shortage of chefs, or the construction sector.  We must come up with a more streamlined and efficient way of operating.  If people want to come to Ireland to work, our attitude should be that we will organise that and make it user-friendly and efficient in order that employers will be able to know that if they need a chef, it will be no problem for them to advertise abroad and get one if they cannot get one here.  We must ensure that this system is streamlined and made efficient in order that people will be able to use it and not have to endure indefinite delays.  When you need workers, you need workers - you need them today, not yesterday.<\/p><p> Small businesses will be really affected in so many different ways because the war is having a distorting effect on our economy.  I do not want to talk about the commerce side versus the humanitarian side.  The humanitarian side of our help is paramount, but hotels, perhaps those in rural locations, are being taken over when small businesses were relying on those hotels to bring in tourists who would keep their businesses going.  They are now worried their businesses will not keep going because tourists will not have a place to stay in these localities.  I even feel bad about comparing one with the other because, again, the most important thing is taking care of people's needs.  These people are leaving a country with nothing more than what is contained in a bag they are carrying with them.  That is the most important thing of all.  However, we must also remember that everyone has responsibility and we must try to balance what we are doing for the greater good of all.  There is concern over issues like that.  I know it is not for the Minister to say that this must be capped or limited at such an amount but I hope that we will ensure that we are able to take care of all of the needs of the people we bring in properly.<\/p><p> The Minister's job is extremely difficult at this time.  When it comes to the trials and tribulations he has, it is a case of us all being on the same team.  We are all interested in the betterment of Ireland Inc. and of neighbouring counties such as Ukraine, but we must balance everything and ensure that we are doing our best by all the people and are trying to make it manageable for families on low incomes to survive during these very difficult times.<\/p><p> My final point concerns housing and the implications of what is happening at present.  A very intelligent and experienced person in the construction side of life made a statement to me last night.  When he said it to me, I promised myself that I would say it to the Minister the next day.  It is not that I think the Minister does not know it; I just want him to hear it again.  This person would have 40 to 50 years' worth of building experience in Ireland and is a very respectable individual who would have provided thousands of homes throughout Ireland.  He told me that when we are at a stage when a garda or a nurse cannot afford to buy a home in any part of Ireland - and he said he was not talking about buying in Dublin - we have lost the plot completely.  He said we are completely wrong and asked what we are going to do about it.  It hit home very hard to me when a person with that experience made that statement.  It is very worrying.  I am not saying this in a way that is critical of the Minister or the Government.  When I say this, I am not trying to say it is this Government's fault.  However, the situation in which we find ourselves is such that a local garda or nurse cannot afford to buy his or her own home, which is extremely worrying and upsetting.  Where does this leave everyone else on all the different steps of the ladder of working life throughout Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#D00500","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>The Department, the Government and I acknowledge that the challenges many families and businesses now face with the rising cost of living are a real challenge for many.  However, this is the reason why at different points this year, we brought forward different measures to try to help people with the rising cost of living.  They involve the change to excise on fuel, the reduction in VAT on gas and electricity and the two additional payments introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Minister for Social Protection to help those at risk of fuel poverty.  Since we announced the budget last year, we have put in place measures worth just under &euro;1.1 billion, all of which try to help people with the cost of living and the rising cost of fuel.  Within that are a number of very targeted measures to help those at risk of fuel poverty.  We have put in place a package that compares very favourably with measures introduced by many other countries and that is concerned with trying to help quickly with challenges we know are real and are having an impact on many.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of a cap on the number of Ukrainian refugees.  I know he did so for compassionate reasons because he is concerned about how we will be able to help those coming to our country and the knock-on effect their arrival could have on the rest of our society.  I will not attribute to him any other intention in raising this point beyond the genuine reason for which he raised it.  However, the reason I take a different view from him is because if we look at where we are as a country, we can see that we are at the furthest possible distance from the war in Ukraine.  We could not be further away from the humanitarian consequences of the war.  It would send out a signal about Ireland that I would not like to see sent out.  We would be saying that despite our distance from the war, we would be the only country in the EU that would place a limit on how many will come.<\/p> <p>  Regarding how we can support those who do come, I accept the Deputy's point that there are difficulties and challenges regarding how we will do it.  I do not need to tell him about the difficulties we had with the availability of accommodation before we had to deal with the arrival of those coming from Ukraine.  What it means is that we will be providing emergency accommodation that will be very different to how we would like to help and support those coming to our country for entirely different reasons.  I do accept that is an issue but it is the reason why we, in turn, have already said that for next year, we will set aside a reserve of &euro;3 billion to give ourselves every chance to try to give decent support to those coming to our country in circumstances that are beyond our imagination.<\/p><p> The final point the Deputy made was on the cost of housing.  The cost of housing is being further exacerbated, in turn, by the increase in the cost of raw materials that is happening all over the world.  That said, it is a positive development to see the level of commencements and completions now taking place in the country.  The supply of new homes, despite the impact of Covid-19 on the country, is at a higher level than I thought possible for much of the pandemic.  It is also the reason that I believe schemes such as help-to-buy have a role in our economy to help those who are trying to get their first home.  It is the reason that I and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, are so committed to the Housing for All programme because we know that while the impact of the war on our society and economy is great, it is not a reason for not continuing to make progress on the great challenges we have regarding the supply and affordability of homes.<\/p><p> That is just a brief response to the variety of measures and issues the Deputy has raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#E00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#F00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and his attendance at the meeting.  I am reminded of the rainy day fund.  With the way things are going between Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine, a rainy day fund would be needed every week to try to keep pace with all the different challenges that have been put before him over the past two and a half years.  It is important that we recognise we are definitely in uncharted times with Covid-19, and now we are in a time of war.  It is uncharted for us in this country that we are affected so much economically by a war that is happening in Europe.  It is frightening in a way.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the budget and our committee's role, we have oversight on the budget and we look at what is happening.  The Minister said forecasting is fraught with uncertainties and with changing events from day to day or even week to week.  However, I wish to hone in on two areas.  The first is trying to keep the economy going and moving forward.  On the works set out in the national development plan, with the inflationary problems we have, will more money become available for capital projects?  It will take more money to do what we were forecasting to do next year and in the following year.  I am especially concerned about projects such as the rural development schemes and the urban regeneration schemes where it is costing more money to do the projects now.  Will money will be available to do them, even for projects that were sanctioned and the budgets set, but those budgets are now gone out the window?<\/p> <p>  The second area is public works contracts.  There is a problem in the construction industry at present.  Projects are priced with a fixed price for up to 30 months.  Contractors are now in a position where they cannot budget for these projects or price them because they cannot see past next week in terms of the costs and the inflationary issues there.  This will have a negative effect.  It is something we need to examine urgently.  I have spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as well.  At this stage we have to look at amending the public works contracts to make them fairer and to allow contractors to be able to price them with an opportunity to cover the risk of hyperinflation, as is taking place now.  It is holding up projects getting done and employment being created in the industry.  I fear that over the next 12 months we will see a retraction in the industry unless something is done to make these contracts more what I would call sharing of the risk, as is the case in every other country in Europe.  Ours is the only country that has such risks attached to the building contractor in public works contracts.<\/p> <p>  In the area of housing, I am glad the Minister said he is a supporter of the help-to-buy scheme.  I ask him to consider extending that to properties that are vacant and derelict to allow second-hand properties to be brought onto the market and make them living spaces for young people who want to live in our villages and towns and even in rural areas.  We need to examine that.<\/p> <p>  These are emergency times, and I heard the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, talking about this in terms of emergency legislation possibly being required to help with housing for the people we are bringing in from Ukraine - rightly so, and we should not cap that.  However, if we are doing emergency legislation to make accommodation available for people coming from Ukraine, we should do it for all.  The housing policy is Housing for All so we need to include that.  If the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is talking about emergency legislation, he should be looking at it in the short term for everybody, so everybody can avail of short-circuiting planning or whatever it takes to get us to a stage where we are building faster and renovating faster to provide homes where people can live and have a quality of life.<\/p> <p>  They are my comments on the budget and the economy at present.  Does the Minister have a response or what does he think of my thoughts on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#F00300","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his points.  I wish to return briefly to a figure I shared earlier with the committee.  I referred to 2.5 million people at work.  That 2.5 million is for 2023 as opposed to 2022.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the points made by Deputy Canney.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is aware of the impact that cost price inflation is having on the viability of contracts.  He is engaging with the OPW and representatives of the construction industry in this regard.  However, we have seen very significant growth in the amount we have set aside for capital expenditure in recent years.  In 2023, our commitment for capital expenditure is &euro;12.4 billion, which is &euro;1.5 billion up on where we were in 2021 and is a &euro;500 million increase on where we are in 2022.  I recall being before this committee when the figure for capital expenditure was approximately &euro;4 billion, so there has been a huge increase in capital investment in recent years.<\/p> <p>  We are planning to sustain it at a high level for some time to come.  The dilemma we have is that, of course, we need to play a role in seeing how we can support projects we are committed to going ahead, but, at the same time, we need to avoid the risk of doing things in our economy that further add to the heating of the inflationary pressures that are in it and create even further difficulties and challenges for ourselves.  There is a balance we need to get right and I know that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who has responsibility for this area and which I share with him, is engaging with stakeholders on this to see if there is a way in which we can get the balance correct.<\/p> <p>  What we want to do is try to support all the projects we are committed to going ahead.  However, the Deputy knows that despite the intention of a Government, not all the things we want to go ahead at any one point in time always do go ahead.  That means there can be flexibility in the capital budget to try to get the right mix of projects going ahead in each year.  However, both the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I would take great care in changing the capital figure in any way significantly because it would have a big knock-on effect on the financial position of the country overall and other choices that we might want to make on the current spending side.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about help to buy.  He and I have debated this on many occasions.  I am still of the view that help to buy should only be focused on creating new supply within our economy as opposed to helping facilitate the purchase of existing homes.  Assisting to renovate empty properties is done through grants and it is best done local authority by local authority.  Housing for All provides significant money to local authorities to do that.  If we were to try to incentivise that via our tax system, help to buy would be on the path to being a general support for purchase of homes that are already built.  Were we to do that, it would directly and definitely add to the existing inflationary trends in our housing market.  I take a different view from the Deputy on the matter.  We are trying to make progress on that through the grants and funding that we have made available to our local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#F00400","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>What is available to the local authorities apart from housing adaptation and housing aid for older people to repair their own stock of houses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#G00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy with the detail of that.

They are blocked-up boarded-up buildings with four walls and maybe a roof.  They are not occupied and have not been lived in for up to 20 or 25 years.  We need to tackle that.  A recent report for the Northern and Western Regional Assembly identified 45,000 such properties in the west and north west of the country alone.  There is great potential for renovating.  Even if only 50% of them were done, it would greatly help in regenerating towns and villages as well as giving people homes.  We need to find a way for that to happen fairly fast.<\/p> <p>  My only other comment on public works contracts is that many local authorities and many contracting authorities have informed me of numerous gateway approvals they need to go through with their projects.  Having been a Minister of State, I understand the frustration of it taking five or six years to get the job to a stage where construction starts.  We need to pull that together.  As the Minister said, the money is available but we need to get the projects started.  We also need a flow of work in construction so that we can attract more people into the construction industry.  They need to have more certainty about continuity of work rather than stop-start when work comes and goes.  We have a bit of shaping up to do on that as well.

The cost-of-living crisis, which is manifested in multiple areas, is the biggest challenge that we have in supply.  It is self-evidently a challenge for large parts of our population, but it will also pose a very serious challenge economically and financially to the State because if people cannot afford to live here, they will not come here in as large numbers as the Minister said we want them to come here to fill some gaps.  In addition, many qualified young people are leaving because they cannot afford to live here.  We need to address that urgently.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said we cannot fully insulate people from the impact of the rising cost of living, the Ukraine crisis and so on.  That is a phrase the Government is using but we could be doing a hell of a lot more than we are.  At the moment our approach to the rising cost of rent and housing is to fill the gap with housing assistance payment, which is just money into the pockets of developers and landlords.  We are chasing the runaway market with public money and it is still not solving the problem.  It is pouring an enormous amount of money down the drain.  Similarly, in another area of rising prices in energy, we are forced to give people additional money because of runaway prices there.<\/p> <p>  Should we not, for which the Minister is aware we have advocated, be trying to actually control the price of these things so that we do not need to throw good money after bad chasing runaway prices?  Why does the Government hold out against having a more serious regime of rent controls, for example?  The Minister may be aware I have highlighted recently that France faced with the same situation has introduced a regime of rent controls where rents are set at affordable levels.  The French do not allow the cost of rent to go up further and therefore beyond the reach of many people.  Should we not do that given the enormous impact that unaffordable rents are having at every level on the people who cannot afford those rents and the number of people it is driving into homelessness with the State trying to chase those rents with nearly &euro;1 billion in HAP, a figure that is likely to rise?  Why do we not try to control rents?<\/p> <p>  I say the same about other types of price increases in energy.  We should try to actually control the prices, not just forgo a small amount of tax revenue or throw a few bob at people to try to manage the bills, although that is better than nothing.  Should we not try to get to the root of it and try to address the fact that these costs are going up because mostly private companies but also some State-owned companies are putting up prices to levels that are simply unaffordable and unsustainable?<\/p> <p>  Would the Minister accept that to a certain degree the cost-of-living crisis is not a crisis for everybody but only a crisis for the majority of working people on low and middle incomes?  Over the difficult period the Minister has characterised with the Ukraine crisis, the Covid crisis before that and possibly back to the financial crash before that with the consequences of austerity and so on, there were always some winners and there are winners even now.  The Minister pointed out that we have significant economic growth and corporate profits have increased consistently.<\/p><p>There are people who are doing okay out of this - presumably, the people who are the beneficiaries of the price rises.  Self-evidently, the landlords do okay out of very high rents.  Some of the big corporations that are charging the high prices are doing fine.  They are doing very well out of this and the more prices go up, the more profit they seem to make.  The energy companies are making lots of profits but the people paying the price are those who have to rent or who have to pay for their heating and energy.  The Government is not doing anything to address that side of it and control those prices, possibly by imposing some sort of windfall tax on the beneficiaries of the current situation.  I would like the Minister to address those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#G00600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Regarding rent caps, as the Deputy will know, the Government has in place limits on the degree to which rent can be increased at any point in time.  The reason we do not have the kind of cap the Deputy wants is that we believe it will ultimately lead to a reduction in the supply of rental accommodation and to even more landlords leaving the rental sector, with the accommodation and rental difficulties of which we are all aware only becoming worse.  That is the reason we have not gone down the path the Deputy wants us to go down.  Over time, it would be a recipe for even fewer rental properties being available, which in turn would be a recipe for higher rents.  Instead, we are doing all we can to either build homes directly or support the supply of homes.  There are some positive signs around our efforts with regard to supply.  In the 12 months up to March of this year, 35,000 new homes were commenced, which is the highest level of commencement since 2008.  The Deputy would make the point that additional supply does not automatically lead to affordable rent or lower pricing of homes but I have yet to come across a situation in which rent would become more affordable or the price of homes would go down by building fewer homes.  I have not come across that.  The precondition to making progress on the affordability of rent and buying, and for first homes in particular, is building more homes and getting more homes built.  That is what we are working very hard to do.  Many will want us to do more, build more homes and make sure they are available at lower rents and lower prices.  We are committing massive resources on behalf of the State to getting those homes built and there is a clear sign now, for the first time in a while, that commencements are going to go solidly above 30,000.  We need to maintain that year after year in order that more homes are available at more affordable rents and more affordable prices.<\/p> <p>  On a windfall tax, I assume the Deputy is referring to the companies involved in the supply of energy.  If we were to look at something like that here in Ireland, it would mean higher taxes on semi-State bodies such as the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  In turn, all that will do is influence the dividend they are going to return to the State or reduce the money they have available to invest in all the things we need to do to reduce our reliance on imported fuel in the first place.   While I can understand the lure and attraction of pushing a policy like that, in this case we ultimately would be talking about semi-State bodies being asked to pay more tax.  Surely the Deputy can see the circular effect that will have on the dividends we receive and the investments we want those companies to go ahead with.  If that is not what the Deputy is referring to, then another option is higher taxes on the suppliers of renewable energy.  Renewable energy is the way out of this, over time, and I would argue that taxing those who are at the heart of trying to provide new sources of energy supply is the wrong direction to go.  That is why we have put in place alternative measures to try to help with the cost of living.  The Deputy will make the case that they are not enough but this year alone, those measures to help those who are facing such challenges are worth over &euro;1 billion.  They will help.  They cannot cover all the costs but I would respectfully contend that they do make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#H00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Am I out of time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#H00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Yes but you may come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#H00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The approach to the affordability of housing is just not working on the ground.  The Minister says supply is increasing.  I accept that.  Everybody can see the cranes around the place.  There are a lot of them in my area.  However, everything coming onto the market is being rented at &euro;2,200 a month or more.  That is no good to anybody.  That supply would be all well and good if it was being delivered at affordable levels but the only people who can buy these homes are investment funds.  They rent them out at shocking rents, which the State picks up the bill for with HAP, or even worse, people just cannot afford them and they go homeless.  Something is not working.  The problem is that there is no control on what these people can charge.  The limited 4% cap on rent increases does nothing about the setting of new rents.  In any event, we are at a level of rent unaffordability that is so bad and damaging that we have to do something radical about it.  I just do not see what we are doing.  Is the Minister suggesting that if Housing for All eventually works, those rents are going to come down?  I do not in any way want to be insulting here but he is living a fantasy if he thinks those rents will come down voluntarily via the market.  They are not going to come down unless the State brings them down or delivers a supply of its own affordable and social housing on a scale that will cover the market failure.  At the moment, even with the increase in supply that is beginning to happen, I just do not see how the rents or the cost of these units will get to a level that is affordable to ordinary people.  I do not see where the plan will make that happen.<\/p> <p>  On the energy stuff, I do not mind which way the Government does it.  I take the Minister's point about the ESB.

I do not mind how we go about doing it.  I am simply stating that these energy companies, whether private or State-owned, are making a lot of money at the moment so they could afford to make fewer profits.

Focusing on the cost of living and looking at the assumptions that underpinned the budget, inflation was at 2.2% but it is at an average of 6.2% this year, according to the SPU.  A social welfare package was outlined in the budget last year to recognise that those on fixed incomes are some of the most vulnerable in society.  The facts now scream at us that this cohort of society will be much poorer this year than last year, and even poorer than in 2020.  The figures indicate that those on core social welfare rates will see their incomes fall by 4% in real terms compared with last year, while compared with 2020, it will be a fall of 6.2%.  Does the Minister accept, given what we know today, that the social welfare package is inadequate to protect the most vulnerable in society from the real price increases that so many families are facing and there is, therefore, a need to increase social welfare core payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#H00900","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the two messages he sent to me.  They were appreciated.  I appreciate the impact that so many face, particularly those on social welfare and fixed incomes, due to the rising cost of energy.  That is why, since the start of the year, we have put in place three separate packages of measures, with much of them being aimed at those who are on low incomes.  It is why we brought in the energy credit, the &euro;125 lump sum payment and added to that with a further &euro;100 payment, as well as changes to the drugs payment scheme and working family payment.  It is also why we took other measures such as the reduction of the public service obligation levy, which will be implemented in October.  Looking at this in the round, the income and social welfare package last year, combined with tax measures, amounted to just over &euro;1 billion.  We have done that again such budget day in recognition of the fact that the cost-of-living challenges that many face are different to what we thought was likely last October.  I accept that the world has changed for the worse for many, but that is why we have done so much to try to respond to the impact that many face on their standard of living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022050400002#J00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>With respect, I benefited from many of those packages, as did the Minister.

We are talking about people who are really vulnerable, trying to get by on really small, fixed incomes and are not, according to the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, anywhere near where they need to be with regard to a minimum standard of income to survive.  The data in the Minister's document show that people are 4% worse off than they were last year.  If he knew when preparing the budget last year that inflation this year would be 6.2%, I am sure he would not have just added &euro;5 to the core social welfare rates.

Targeted measures have been brought in.  Looking at where we are now, compared with where I thought we would be on budget day, it just was not possible for anybody to forecast what would happen early in the new year with Ukraine, let alone the impact it would have on inflation this year.

I would bring in a social welfare package that would match the levels of inflation we are seeing.  It is not a case of having just one or the other, but there is also a need for targeted measures.  The energy crisis is one issue that is increasing inflation and is turbocharged by the war in Ukraine.  Many commentators are predicting that we may enter a prolonged period of high energy costs, outside of the war in Ukraine, because of the transition towards a green economy with non-carbon sources of energy, and that this may be the future for energy prices.

I think the case for indexation is well understood from a social welfare point of view, but it tends to be less appreciated in respect of income tax.  The fact is that if an effort is not made to move the entry point into higher rates of income tax year by year, as wages in the economy grow, people working an extra hour of overtime, who might get a wage increase, lose far more of that than they would expect to our tax code.  If I had not made the changes I have made in recent years to the standard rate cut-off point, that is, the point at which one pays the higher rate of income tax, I have no doubt but that I would be accused of bringing in stealth taxes and not allowing people to keep a fair share of the income they earn with their own hands and their own skills.<\/p><p> As for whether I have any plans to make it automatic, I do not because I strongly believe it should always be the prerogative of the Government and the Ministers for Finance and Social Protection to decide what to do on budget day.  In an environment in which not so long ago, we were at far lower levels of inflation than we are now, the changes that would happen if we were committed to automatic indexation, particularly of social welfare, would be of such a low level that it would undermine the legitimacy of trying to carry out indexation in the first instance.

While a change was under way in any event with regard to that because of the awareness we all have regarding how emissions are having such an awful effect on our environment, year by year we have made changes to our tax code that have encouraged that change.  The Government will decide whether to continue with that approach on budget day.

We have covered the issue of the tightening labour market quite well and I do not want to revisit much of that.  The Minister mentioned the idea of ensuring visas are working well.  In his and my constituency, a large number of people have stamp 3 visas, which make it very difficult to work even for those who may be very willing to do so.  That area might be worth examining.  In light of that labour market issue, in a climate with that level of inflation and the cost of living increases, we are probably facing increases in public sector pay and in pay more generally, but that does not seem to have been budgeted or mentioned much in the SPU.

It is great to see democracy in action.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its invitation to contribute to its scrutiny of the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill.  The Alliance for Insurance Reform consists of 47 civic and business organisations from across Ireland, representing more than 55,000 members, 700,000 employees, 622,000 volunteers and 374,000 students.  Our single aim is to get insurance premiums down to affordable levels and keep them that way.<\/p> <p>  The alliance recently carried out a policyholder survey to mark the first anniversary of the implementation of the pivotal judicial guidelines for personal injury damages on 24 April 2021.  Among other findings, 42% of respondents said that insurance costs were threatening the future of their organisations.  This figure was not materially different from the response to the same question in research that we carried out in 2018 and presented to this committee in May of that year.  Some 31% said that insurance costs were preventing them from providing certain services.  This was up from 26% in the 2018 survey.<\/p> <p>  Our ongoing survey of insurance policy renewals since the implementation of the judicial guidelines indicates that liability premiums have increased by 16%.  It must be noted that this increase is on top of the savage increases experienced by many policyholders each year since 2017.<\/p><p>The most recent survey shows that 73% of organisations have also had additional excesses or exclusions imposed on their policies since 2019.  These are stealth increases pushing additional risk and cost onto policyholders.  Worryingly, that percentage is up from 65% in the 2018 survey.  Ultimately, 90% of respondents to the survey said that the Government is not doing enough to address the issue of insurance costs. <\/p><p> This final figure requires some context.  While reforms to date are having an impact on motor premiums, which our survey shows are trending at minus 9% since May of last year, they are not having an impact on the liability premiums paid by businesses, voluntary and community groups, sports and cultural organisations and charities, which continue to increase and with additional excesses and exclusions as outlined.  In addition, as we highlighted to this committee in December, increasing numbers of sectors and sub-sectors cannot get cover or are reduced to one underwriter, which inevitably results in huge increases in premiums.  A current list of 44 such sectors and sub-sectors is included in appendix 3 of our presentation.  The crisis is existential in many of those sectors. <\/p><p> While it is widely acknowledged that the correct reforms have been targeted, much of the frustration evident in that statistic is about the delays and extremely slow progress on key reforms and the reluctance of insurers to pass on the benefits of the reforms already in place such as the judicial guidelines, the new Garda insurance fraud co-ordination office and the perjury Act, while appearing to be willing to do so in the more competitive private motor insurance market.  <\/p><p> To restore policyholder faith in the insurance reform process, the Government must do everything in its power to make sure incumbent insurers pass on the benefits of reforms.  It must move quicker on getting additional competition into the market and must speed up key promised reforms.  An office within the Department of Finance to encourage greater competition in the insurance market was established in December 2020 but has still not announced any additional market entries.  For this office to be successful, the attractiveness of the Irish market to new insurers must be protected and further developed through rebalancing the duty of care, reforming the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and protecting the new judicial guidelines.  <\/p><p> The duty of care obligations imposed on businesses and voluntary groups must be re-balanced.  The current legislation, as it is interpreted in the courts, often places an unfair absolute responsibility on occupiers while exempting claimants of any responsibility for their own safety.  The Cabinet sub-group on insurance reform action plan of December 2020 committed to a deadline of June 2021 for submitting proposals to Government to implement any changes deemed necessary.  However, these proposals have still not been submitted to Government. <\/p><p> PIAB must be reformed if it is to remain in any way relevant.  Legislation to address this is moving slowly through pre-legislative scrutiny.  While the alliance welcomes much of the content of the draft legislation, an enhanced role for PIAB was scheduled for June 2021 by the Cabinet sub-group on insurance reform so this initiative is now well behind schedule. <\/p><p> The implementation of the judicial guidelines has seen the value of assessments by PIAB tumble by 42% compared to those using the old book of quantum.  However, the acceptance rate of these assessments has reduced from 50% to 37% as more claimants move to litigation so the attitude of insurers that settle the vast majority of litigated liability claims before they get to court and the approach of the Judiciary once such claims finally get to court will be extremely influential on the success or otherwise of the guidelines.  Additionally, the State must robustly defend the multiple constitutional challenges to the guidelines being pursued by the legal profession intent on protecting the revenue stream generated by personal injury litigation.  Ultimately, the Government must get liability insurance premiums down to affordable levels with reforms that keep them that way.  <\/p><p> Where does the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill 2021 fit into this?  The proposed legislation seeks to require insurance providers to provide information to the Central Bank of Ireland relating to the effect of personal injuries guidelines and related matters and in particular, as we understand it, to compel insurers to report on what they charged for insurance policies impacted by the judicial guidelines compared to what they might reasonably have been expected to charge if the judicial guidelines had not been implemented.<\/p><p> The Alliance for Insurance Reform welcomes any attempt to increase transparency and accountability.  As policyholders are either legally or morally obliged to buy motor and liability insurance, which places insurers in a very privileged position and makes policyholders particularly vulnerable, this sector needs special scrutiny.  In this context, the introduction of the national claims information database, NCID, by the Central Bank has been a pivotal development in addressing the current crisis and the alliance has strongly supported its development.  However, the NCID is only of value if the data are timely, robust and beyond doubt.  The same must apply to any data produced via the Bill under scrutiny today and in this regard, we do have some concerns.  In particular, we have a concern that the meaning of the words \"might reasonably have been expected\" in subsections (4)(b), (4)(d), (4)(f) and (4)(h) of the proposed new section 100 might be open to interpretation and vary from insurer to insurer.  Also, given the potential complexity of the data, we would be concerned that there will be a time lag between the measured events and the publication of the data, which may weaken the value of the data from a policymaking perspective.  We assume that the Central Bank has or will be consulted in detail on the viability of this legislation given its central role in the provision of the data and its ongoing experience with the NCID.  We further assume that it has been asked whether there are other ways of measuring insurers' delivery of the benefits of the judicial guidelines within the current NCID framework.  For example, we understand that the upcoming NCID fourth private motor insurance report scheduled for October will have data on insurer settlements pre and post the judicial guidelines, as well as premium costs per sector.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, we warmly welcome any additional transparency in this sector, particularly on the delivery of much-needed reductions in premiums, but the primary focus must remain on the real reforms that will deliver those reductions.  Of all the major challenges facing Ireland right now, insurance is the one that Government can fix quickest but reforms are not moving fast enough.  It is clear that neither the Irish economy nor the fabric of society will fully recover from Covid-19 unless insurance is sorted.  Government has a golden opportunity to make the cost of insurance affordable now and forever but only if it gets reforms into place now before the opportunity is lost.  This concludes our formal presentation.  As an alliance, we are intensely aware of how urgent this issue is for our members and their employees and volunteers.  We hope the committee can help us in getting meaningful action quickly and we are now happy to take questions.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for facilitating me, as sponsor of the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill 2021, to make opening remarks before I proceed to questioning Mr. Boland of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, who I welcome to the meeting.  I also wish to welcome Ms Moyagh Murdock of Insurance Ireland, who will be appearing before the committee later.  Before we start, it is important to give my perspective on the legislation.<\/p> <p>  The personal injuries guidelines have been in effect for just over a year.  This was a direct result of the Judicial Council Act, which received cross-party support in these Houses in 2019.  These personal injuries guidelines had a very specific objective, namely, to drive down award levels for personal injuries and in turn, to drive down insurance premiums.  This was a reform that the insurance industry lobbied for over many years.  Some of the largest players gave cast-iron commitments before this committee that they would pass on these savings to their customers euro for euro.  <\/p> <p>  Since guidelines came into effect, award levels through PIAB have fallen by 42%.  This will pass through to the courts in due course.  Unless these savings are passed on to consumers, these guidelines provide a windfall for the industry.  There is no mechanism available to the D&aacute;il, the Government or indeed the Central Bank to monitor whether these savings are being or have been passed on to consumers.  While the NCID provides granular and highly valuable data on price and claim trends, it does not detail the relationship between these trends or attribute one to the other.<\/p><p>This point was made clear by representatives of the Central Bank at this committee on 8 December, where they said that while the national information claims database can monitor premium trends, it cannot disentangle premium trends to specific reforms or attribute them to specific reforms and nor can it create a counterfactual scenario.  That is precisely what we need if we are to ensure that consumers see the benefits of the personal injury guidelines and the Judicial Council Act 2019.  That is the purpose of this legislation before us.<\/p><p> What would the legislation do?  It would require individual insurers to provide annual reports for a period of four years to the Central Bank and it would require them to outline the amount paid in third-party personal injury claims and how much would have been paid had the personal injury guidelines not come into effect.  It would also require them to outline the average premiums charged and what would have been charged had the personal injury guidelines not come into effect, with this information audited by a qualified auditor.  This information would then be presented to the Central Bank and the Minister and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would ensure transparency and accountability.<\/p><p> As to whether there is a precedent for this, yes, there is.  Under regulations now enforced in Britain, AIG, AXA, Alliance, Aviva, Zurich and RSA, which are all the biggest players here in Ireland, will be required to provide similar information to the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, with respect to whiplash awards.  Are these provisions stronger?  Yes, they are but that is a good thing.<\/p><p> I recognise that broader reforms are necessary in the insurance sector, including through reforms in the duty of care which Mr. Boland has mentioned in his opening statement, reforms to PIAB and increased competition.  However this legislation would provide a mechanism, which does not currently exist, to hold individual insurance companies to account, to ensure that the personal injury guidelines in whole or in part do not provide a windfall in savings to insurance companies but instead benefit consumers, individuals and businesses through lower insurance premiums.<\/p><p> That is my opening statement outlining, as we begin detailed legislative scrutiny on this legislation, the intentions behind the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill 2021 as its author.  I will now turn to Mr. Boland with regard to the survey that the Alliance for Insurance Reform carried out with quite a number of respondents.  I think there were 954 respondents.  What was the average decrease since these guidelines have come into effect with regard to insurance for businesses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#B00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>There was no decrease.

The circumstances which have driven private motor insurance down by an average of 9%, a figure that is accelerating according to CSO figures and is at minus 12% here to date, are exactly the same circumstances that apply to the liability insurance market.  Insurance is calculated on future risk.  The future risk applicable to both sectors has dropped because of the judicial guidelines, the establishment of the Garda insurance fraud co-ordination office and the perjury Act.  Moreover, much other activity is slated on the horizon.  It is moving too slowly but it is coming.<\/p> <p>  What we have on the motor side appears to be a decent level of competition and because of that competition, the benefits are being passed on to consumers.  While it is fair to say that there are quite a few underwriters underwriting liability insurance, when one drills down to individual sectors or sub-sectors, typically policyholders are left with only one underwriter.  That is not healthy competition.  In many cases, accidental monopolies are being created where only one underwriter is prepared to offer cover.  Typically what our members find is that when they get to that situation the cost of the policy rockets and when they query the cost they are told that is just the market.

The area I have a particular concern about is anything to do with children.  Play centres, playgrounds, bouncy castles and many types of educational establishments, particularly in the early years sector, are threatened by the cost of insurance or the lack of the availability of cover.  This is not a challenge that other countries face.  If we want our children to grow up as robust individuals with a good understanding of risk and we want them to be able to socialise, to play actively, to be outdoors in either organised or unorganised environments, we must get insurance sorted.  That is just one sector I have picked but there are plenty of other sectors that have the same sort of existential threat around them at the moment.  This is unique to Ireland.  It is not happening elsewhere in Europe.  Many of our member organisations have recounted European meetings where it has taken them quite some time to explain the predicament they are faced with in Ireland because it does not exist anywhere else.  That is why it needs to be sorted.  Even at a macro level, that affects our competitiveness in sectors where we are competing directly with other countries, for example, in tourism, where price can be important.

The companies pass much of the requirement on to the State to reduce the risk and many efforts have been made to reduce the level of risk for insurance companies and their actions, yet we are hearing these startling figures reflecting the rise in premiums.  This might be a question for Deputy Pearse Doherty too.  Looking to what the premiums were and what they would have been is a good drilling-down exercise.  Nevertheless, it strikes me that insurance companies are focusing less on the actuarial assessment of risk and more on the assessment of opportunity, and that the opportunity seems to be found in a small market, with the State underwriting much of the risk and offering potential for greater profits.  In pulling out that information on how the margin of profit on certain kinds of insurance product, particularly in regard to liability, has increased, the return to shareholders and the relationship between that, is that a factor that should be taken into account?<\/p> <p>  There is also that question of over-provisioning, whereby the companies maintain we need to wait some time to see how this will play out.  If it turns out the insurance industry has overestimated for a period, say, from 2021 to 2023 or 2024, should there not be a carryover to some extent of that over-provisioning period to 2024 or 2025, rather than simply beginning to give a different form of assessment in 2024 and 2025?  Has the industry made any indication in that regard?  It will have had a period in which its calculations expected greater payouts than it was required to make.<\/p> <p>  I worry that the narrative has often related to the relationship between the duty of care and the claimant.  That becomes the dynamic, rather than this question of the margin taken by companies, although I appreciate Deputy Doherty's Bill for refocusing on that.  Mr. Boland might comment on this because the alliance has a range of members, not least in terms of liability.  There is a risk in allowing the current model of insurance to continue with too many public policy goals.  It is not about ensuring just that the insurance companies are not taking up their responsibility in respect of risk.  They are, in fact, creating risks, for example, to the State on issues such as the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, whereby all people are meant to be able to participate fully in public life.  Similarly, we have had reports of insurance companies requiring trees to be removed by local authorities even though we have climate and biodiversity targets that those local authorities need to meet through these pre-emptive measures.  This element is not just bad in itself but is distorting other aspects of the public policy landscape and the public good landscape, as the alliance&rsquo;s members will agree.<\/p> <p>  The State is not just underwriting the risk but also creating opportunities for the insurance companies because it is rightly requiring insurance from those who bid for contracts and those who provide services.  In fact, insurance requirements have put many NGOs and voluntary organisations in a position whereby they cannot equally tender for the provision of services or, in some cases, cannot even apply for State grants because they cannot meet the same insurance costs as, for example, a private operator.  I do not want Mr. Boland to name specific members, but he might comment on whether they are elements that have been identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#F00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":576,"content":"<p>The Senator asked some very comprehensive questions, which I will deal with in the round by focusing primarily on the voluntary and community sector.  Our membership is not homogenous.  Different circumstances face different sectors but, certainly, when the voluntary and community sector interacts with the State, the State often imposes very onerous responsibilities regarding the level of indemnity and cover required in order to interact with it.  That applies not just to service providers but also to sectors such as festivals, for example.  If they want to use public land, they have to indemnify local authorities up to, in some cases, a level of &euro;13 million to get access to public ground.  A significant insurance cost is involved, therefore, in engaging with the State.  I mentioned the obligatory element of insurance in my opening statement.  It is not a straightforward market, and considerable power is given to insurers because we are obliged to interact with them.  This is a major issue from the point of view of the voluntary and community sector.  As for how onerous it is in regard to issues such as the cutting-down of trees or the removal of play areas, this is not something that happens elsewhere.  It is quite unique to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the question about duty of care, there are many moving parts to this and they have been identified for some time.  We are, by and large, in agreement with the current action plan on insurance reform.  A core number of reforms therein, including the judicial guidelines and reforms relating to duty of care, are central to getting this resolved, but all the moving parts will have to be addressed to ensure not only that we reduce the cost of insurance now but that it will remain low because we do not want to have to appear before the committee again in ten years and announce there is another crisis.  We want it to be resolved now and for the long term.<\/p> <p>  From the point of voluntary and community in particular, I am concerned that when this reform process is over, there will remain sectors that cannot get cover.  The State, whether it likes it or not, will have to consider what to do with certain sectors.  Certainly, the Department of Finance is not very enthusiastic about engaging on that right now because it is very focused on the broader issues that apply to the entire market, but the State is going to have to consider the issue in due course.<\/p><p>If we believe a service or organisation is of value to the State, but it simply cannot get going, that has to be considered.<\/p><p> The Senator commented on risk.  I suspect that when it comes to pricing policies and liability, the direct relationship between risk and the pricing of insurance has been broken.  One often gets a sense from members that it is more about ability to bear prices.  Turnover is discussed, even where turnover does not increase the risk.  If the average spending in an organisation is increasing, turnover also increases.  It will still affect the cost of insurance.  As with the example I gave, if an organisation goes from having two underwriters to one, then the price almost automatically goes up.  That is an accepted fact at this stage.  It is clearly nothing to do with risk.  It is just about competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I will give Deputy Doherty an opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#G00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>To address the Senator's point, we have tried to remain focused in this legislation.  Some of her comments reflect the position taken by the Central Bank on price walking or dual pricing.  I complained and brought this to its attention, as did others, including in the media.  When we initially wanted to ban this practice, we looked at a dual process.  One part involved submitting a complaint to and meeting the Governor of the Central Bank, who agreed to carry out an investigation on the back of that.  The second part involved drafting legislation to ban the practice, which we were progressing through the House.  It did more than ban price walking, since it banned some of the predatory practices used by the insurance industry, so that premiums would have to be based on risk, along with a profit margin, operating cost and so on.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked a question about profits.  We have information about the sector's profits, which are reported on by the national claims information database each year.  It gives a breakdown of public liability and motor insurance.  We are able to see the profits across the sector.  They were quite high, especially for motor insurance, in 2020, the last year for which data are available.  The operating profits were 12% of the income.  That is four times higher than the average in the previous decade, which the Central Bank calls hyper profits.  Many insurance companies before this committee would talk about trying to have profit margins of about 4%.  That spells out the gouging that is happening.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned reforms that have taken place and more that have to take place relating to, for example, the duty of care.  The key thing about this legislation is that, while we have been passing legislation to try to drive down insurance costs, there is no way for us to ensure insurance companies actually drive down costs.  We cannot force them to do so.  We are trying to introduce transparency.  There are commitments to look for fraud and look at awards.  Awards make up much of the cost of insurance.  This legislation places an onus on these companies that operate in Britain.  Mr. Boland mentioned Manchester.  For many of these companies, Ireland is like Manchester, since it is a subdivision of a larger British company.  They have a responsibility in Britain following changes to whiplash awards introduced by the House of Commons, which were lower than here in the first place and were driven down further.  Those provisions sought to ensure that every reduction in awards was passed on to consumers.  This would need to be replicated across the board.  If we rebalance the duty of care, we need to ensure that it is not pocketed by the insurance industry and does not just lead to more profits because of the lack of competition.  Companies cannot be forced to do this but we can collect data, have more transparency and, where necessary, call companies out for not living up to the commitments they gave these Houses when they looked for changes in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#G00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Doherty and Mr. Boland.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Jacqueline Thornton, director of regulation and policy development; Mr. Michael Horan, manager of policy and regulation; and Mr. Florian Wimber, director of advocacy, communications and public affairs. <\/p><p> Insurance Ireland is the representative body of the Irish insurance industry.  We represent approximately 130 members providing cover to more than 25 million customers in more than 110 countries.  The total value of assets of the Irish insurance industry is &euro;489 billion.  The insurance sector, including Insurance Ireland members, employs 35,000 people in Ireland and generates approximately &euro;1.6 billion in tax income per year.  Ireland is the fifth largest market for insurance in the European Union and the biggest exporter of insurance services.<\/p><p> Insurance Ireland and its members firmly support the agenda for insurance reform and the implementation of the personal injuries guidelines.  We greatly appreciate the efforts the Government and Members of the Oireachtas have made to progress these reforms.  Many members of this committee have worked on insurance and claims cost reforms for years.  Insurance Ireland advocated for the introduction of the personal injuries guidelines, which seek to reduce and ensure consistency in the level of awards for personal injuries.  The personal injuries guidelines have the potential to represent a milestone in the Irish insurance market if they are consistently applied.  We note the recent PIAB, award values report, which confirmed the application of the guidelines by PIAB and the impact the new guidelines have had on the awards levels to date.  However, we are concerned about the decreasing acceptance rates of PIAB awards by claimants since the guidelines' introduction.  It is reasonable to assume that this trend is leading to more cases going to litigation.  The backlog in the courts and the ongoing legal challenges to the personal injuries guidelines present significant uncertainties as to the efficacy of the guidelines.<\/p><p> While Insurance Ireland cannot comment on pricing-related aspects of the guidelines, a commitment to pass on claims savings was given to the Oireachtas by insurance company CEOs when they appeared before this committee.  We understand the motivation and interest from political decision makers in monitoring the impact of the personal injuries guidelines and providing transparency to the public.  Two proposals have been presented to fulfil this function, namely, the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill 2021, which this committee is discussing today, and the provisions included in the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022.  The proposals in the first Bill follow the example of the UK&rsquo;s Civil Liability Act 2018, while the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill makes targeted amendments to the existing reporting and disclosure requirements for the national claims information database, NCID.  While both proposals might fulfil the envisaged objective, we strongly believe that the provisions proposed under the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill are more effective and that outputs will be delivered more expediently.  This Bill, while intended to achieve the same outcome, would duplicate existing and alternative data sources such as the NCID, which already captures granular information on premiums and claim costs over a number of years.<\/p><p> The data sourced from the NCID allow for the monitoring of trends such as the impact of a changing regulatory and economic environment.  As it stands today, all insurance firms providing insurance services for private motor and employer and public liability in Ireland already submit to the NCID.  The data collected from the NCID undergo rigorous review and enhancement.  Moreover, under the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, a mandate for the Central Bank to collect further data is planned.  We also understand the Central Bank is already working on additional reporting requirements to track the impact of the personal injuries guidelines more effectively.  The establishment of the NCID and the annual reports produced have served to significantly improve data availability in the Irish insurance market, as well as support policy analysis on premiums, claims costs and deriving trends over a long period.  The collection of these data enables the Central Bank to publish an annual report containing analysis of the cost of claims, the cost of premiums, how claims are settled, how settlement costs vary depending on how claims are settled, and an analysis of the various types of costs, such as legal costs, that make up settlements.  The NCID is already a comprehensive independent data repository that tracks the performance of the Irish motor and liability markets.  The additional improvements to the NCID will enhance its value in improving transparency within the Irish insurance market further.  Therefore, the development of the NCID should be prioritised, instead of creating a parallel and duplicative data reporting and sourcing stream.<\/p><p> This Bill seeks to align Irish regulation with UK regulation at times when other jurisdictions are moving in different directions.  The UK system will provide its first data in October 2023.  At that point in time, the NCID will already have informed the discussion in Ireland for more than three years.  The NCID system is up and running and reports have and will be published throughout 2022 and 2023, long before the UK regulators and public will see the outcome of their exercise.  The NCID provides factual and detailed data that enable Members of the Oireachtas to verify whether Irish insurers pass on savings to their customers, and will help inform any public policy decisions that may be needed with regards to future reforms.<\/p><p> We understand the interest in monitoring the impact of the application of the personal injuries guidelines and we support these efforts.  We will support initiatives to collect the necessary data to assess the progress of the guidelines and to enable informed policy discussions.  We advocate for a proportionate, sound and sensible approach to collecting this information.  In our opinion, the more proportionate way of doing this is through the NCID.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to present our position.  I look forward to answering any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee and thank Ms Murdock for her opening statement.

We may see, for example, hypothetically, a trend that awards have reduced by 10% and that premiums have reduced by X amount.  However, what we will not ever have the ability to do unless we pass this legislation is to find out from AXA, Zurich, Aviva or Allianz what amount of money they have saved from the reduction in awards and whether it has been passed on in the premiums.

That is quite a significant number of policyholders, especially considering that the report was based on in excess of 300,000 actual policies.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Insurance Ireland and possible new members, we are a trade representative body and we are funded by our members.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#O01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I would never have guessed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022050400002#O01400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":745,"content":"<p>It is in our interest to bring as many new providers into the market as possible.

The regulator has different categories of risk and will check whether the company is high, medium or low risk.  It is very important to have this level of transparency from the regulator.  Leaving aside legislation and from a pure supervisory perspective, a company that wants to do business in this country should know what to expect from the regulator.  A high-risk firm should be told the regulator will have a team whose job it is to speak to it on a fairly regular basis.  It should be told it will be included in all of the information requests.  It should be told the approximate levies for doing business and that these may change if the business model changes because the risk model will also change.

Ireland is not a gigantic market.  The scalability of a new business coming in is an important factor, as is the return on investment in setting up new business, as Ms Murdock described.  Insurance usually does not start as a generic new operation.  Existing insurance companies invest in setting up in new markets or, as we have the benefit of the free market of the European Union, they export insurance from their major jurisdiction into Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The question on this is twofold.  One element is what we discussed at length with regard to predictability and volatility in certain market segments and certain market data.  The other is the extra cost of coming to Ireland and doing business here compared with Germany, France, the Netherlands or wherever the group might originate.  There is a good reason for the additional requirements in Ireland.  One of them, which we discussed, is the national claims information database which does not exist in other markets.  We all agree it is of benefit.  These parts add a layer to what a company must do to do business in Ireland.  The question is how much companies can bear these costs to enter a market that is opening up.  For example, with regard to the NCID for companies active in the non-life market in Ireland, there is a threshold of &euro;25 million at which reporting requirements start.  Below this companies do not face it.  From the start, the burden is quite significant compared with the potential market size.  The additional element is where a company wants to establish a subsidiary or branch in Ireland.  The authorisation aspect of setting up a subsidiary in Ireland is significantly lengthy and we see a challenge there.  The attractiveness varies from market segment to segment.

As the Chairman has mentioned, I am joined by Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer.  While exercises on lessons learned on the pandemic are under way throughout the world, it can be seen from objective data relating to mortality, hospitalisation and vaccination uptake that the response to the pandemic in Ireland was among the best in the world.  <i>The Lancet<\/i>recently published a major global review of excess mortality during the pandemic with data from countries and subnational regions throughout the world.  It found that &quot;some countries ... such as Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and Cyprus had some of the lowest rates [of excess mortality] in the world, at less than 50 deaths per 100,000&quot;.  As members know, the rate in Ireland was 12.5 per 100,000 of population.  The cumulative rate of recorded Covid-19 deaths per million of population in Ireland remained consistently below the EU average throughout the pandemic.<br\/><br\/>Nonetheless we have seen over 7,000 deaths from Covid-19, as well as high levels of illness.<\/p><p>Both the societal and economic consequences of the past two years are well known to members of the committee, with the pandemic costing the Irish Exchequer circa &euro;20 billion to date.  In the context of such costs, it is right that governments and health systems around the world are now investing significantly in public health capacity.  In the Department of Health we are working to find new and innovative ways to refocus and to strengthen public health capacity.  A clear component of this is to develop leadership capacity in public health in order to strengthen and to prepare in the event of future pandemics.  This is set out in the programme for Government.<\/p><p> As I have set out previously, I had initial discussions with the CMO in August 2021 about his future plans, as did the Secretary to the Government.  Given the changing disease profile and concerns about emerging variants, those discussions were necessarily paused until earlier this year, when disease indicators confirmed that Ireland was in a much better epidemiological position.  At that point, and in the context of Ireland's future pandemic preparedness, the CMO raised with some third level institutions how the Department of Health could, in an innovative and responsive manner, strengthen the knowledge and practice of public health leadership.  These engagements had particular regard to public health protection, informing policymaking, understanding the role of public communications and behaviour change and research of relevance to these domains.  Over the course of these engagements, the proposal for a professorship emerged.  The purpose of this was to ensure that Dr. Holohan's expertise and skill set remained within the public service, with a view to strengthening public health capacity and leadership in Ireland.  In this role the Department's intention was for Dr. Holohan to lead the development and activities of collaboration between all universities and the health sector and to develop stronger links with the WHO and agencies of the EU.<\/p><p> On 25 February of this year, the CMO requested my support to progress a secondment to a Dublin university.  He indicated that he had informed the Secretary to the Government of this request.  In early March the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and I confirmed that I was working on the details of this arrangement, including the proposed research funding element.  I was aware that the Government had recently endorsed particular secondment arrangements to the university sector for senior civil servants.  Given his long and distinguished service and the crucial knowledge and ability he brought to bear in the pandemic, I felt it was equally important that Dr. Holohan's expertise be retained and utilised in the public sector.<\/p><p> Further discussions took place, and the Department issued a letter of intent to Trinity College on 16 March which set out the main details of the proposals, with further detail on secondment arrangements to be agreed between the relevant HR departments of Trinity College and the Department of Health.  As part of these proposed arrangements, the Department considered that the funding of Dr. Holohan's post was something that needed to be worked out but that the Department would support the development of this innovative approach to progressing an important initiative through dedicated additional research funding.  It was envisaged that this would involve competitive funding organised appropriately to support the spirit of the initiative outlined above.  The letter of intent therefore provided for Dr. Holohan's salary to be paid, in time, as part of a wider fund which, it was envisaged, could be administered by the Health Research Board, with details to be agreed between all three parties, as per the well-established practice of funding of health research in the third level sector.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, there are a number of well-recognised steps from the generation of an idea to the funding of a specific project or service that all Departments and Ministers must follow in order to allocate funds.  It was clear to me that this proposal was in line with the Government's commitment to investing in public health, as outlined in the programme for Government.  As such, and as required, funding of research in this regard by the Department would form part of the normal Estimates process, subject to ministerial and Cabinet approval.<\/p><p> It is a matter of regret to me that what I viewed as an important and innovative proposal for increasing our public health capacity in Ireland is now not going ahead.  I believe that this important work would have benefited greatly by being led by Dr. Holohan.  I believed when we conceived this proposal that it was essential that we continued to harness Dr. Holohan's knowledge and skills in the public interest, and I regret that that will no longer be possible.<\/p><p> I am happy to answer any questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":857,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Watt.

He talked very vaguely about things and said that the letter to Trinity was from the Department.  It was from Mr. Watt himself.  This is all about how Mr. Watt handled this matter.  He talked about that letter setting out the main draft details.  They are not really draft details.  They are very specific in the letter to Trinity.  He said that \"Dr. Holohan's post was something that needed to be worked out\" but that is not the impression that Mr. Watt gave in the letter to the Provost of Trinity.  Mr. Watt very specifically said: \"Under the proposed agreement the Department of Health commits to...\".  So Mr. Watt was committing the Department of Health to funding not only for the first year, a figure of &euro;2 million, but he was committing to multi-annual funding over a period of about ten years and that comes to a figure of about &euro;20 million, which is a very substantial amount of money.  In addition, there is the question of Dr. Holohan's salary over that period and, conservatively, that is probably in the region of &euro;3 million.  So Mr. Watt was making a commitment of &euro;23 million of taxpayers' money without the authority to do so.  This was not a vague thing where one was going to work out the details.  Mr. Watt committed in his letter to Trinity and I believe that he went beyond his authority and power to do that.  It is very hard to understand the mentality of somebody who would do that.  A sum of &euro;23 million is a huge amount of money so I would expect that a Secretary General in a Department would first get informal approval and certainly make the Minister aware of what he proposed to do.  Mr. Watt already committed taxpayers' money in that letter and I do not think that is an acceptable action for a Secretary General to take.<\/p> <p>  Where did Mr. Watt get the figure of &euro;2 million a year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#L01200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy, the letter says very clearly that the details have \"to be worked out\" and we were appointing somebody to work that out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>The letter very clearly says that he commits to \"...ake an annual ring-fenced allocation of &euro;2M for the duration of the secondment\".

I will let others judge the impact of anything I have done over the course of the previous 15 years.  It does not take from any of that, in my view.  I would take the opportunity to say the things we have done in as a country in relation to the pandemic have not been things I have singularly done.  I have been visible in ways that many people have not been, but there has been enormous effort and I could start in the Department and go all the way from there to the front line of the health services.

I did have the opportunity when I spoke to the committee the last day to make clear that from my point of view that was important.  The reason it was important was because if I was to say I was stepping back for a five-year period, as some have suggested, because that is the usual period of time for Department to Department secondments, it would create a doubt and uncertainty over the potential tenure of any successor of mine.  It would probably fetter the competition or likely make the competition for a successor less attractive.  Fewer people would apply and the possibility of me returning would arise for person who was successful.  I wanted to make clear, therefore, and this is the commitment I made to the Department out of respect for the role and the potential appointment of a successor, whoever that would be, that I did not have an intention in seeking to come back as CMO, even if in the secondment terms it meant that, strictly speaking, if I wished, I could come back at some point in some other role.  I wanted to be clear so that the ground could be left clear for another individual to decide to apply for the job and know he or she would have a full and clear mandate in doing that job in the same way as I had.  I thought that was important for the role.

If things had gone the way they should have, we would be in a different situation, addressing the challenges of the public health services in this country, which should get and need to get priority at this time.  Like other members, I believe there is still time to rescue the issue, and every effort should be made by everybody involved to ensure that will be done as a matter of urgency.  I ask Dr. Holohan and the Secretary General to re-examine the matter with a view to ascertaining whether it might be possible at this stage to salvage something in the interests of the country, the public health system and the reputations of all involved.<\/p><p> Long ago, I suggested that having learned from the experiences earlier during the Covid pandemic, we should apply them in general to the delivery of the public health services.  That was a natural thing to happen, and it should and must happen.  We must draw from the success of those experiences.  I fully appreciate the great effort made by Dr. Holohan, NPHET, the team in the Department of Health and the team throughout the country.  It was a very significant effort 24-7, on call all the time for a protracted period, in a way that was exemplary.  We have to record our appreciation of what has been done so far, which can be done again.  If we go off in different directions, however, as we are doing now, distracting ourselves and taking away the focus of attention from the issues that need to be dealt with, that would be sad and a failure.<\/p><p> I have no reason to be acrimonious towards anybody.  There is no need for it and no gain for anybody in it.  It does not work.  Members of the committee, Ministers or whoever being at loggerheads or cross-purposes with one another or with Departments serves no public purpose.  I hope lessons will be learned and I hope Mr. Watt has learned some lessons as well.  The lesson I see, as a former Minister of State like other members of the committee, is that there can be no proceeding anywhere without the approval and the updating of the Minister concerned.  It cannot be done.  It always ends in tears.  The necessity, therefore, is that wherever issues such as this one arise in the future, lessons that have been learned will be put into practice and, as a result, we can proceed knowing that whatever we do will be done in the national interest and the best interests of anybody.  It is important to recognise that, not least as we proceed to the challenges I referred to earlier.<\/p><p> In that context, there are now unprecedented waiting lists in every hospital in the country and in every department therein. It has been shown to the committee in the past that some people, in particular those who have been well placed in the services, can achieve great results.  It is a question of bringing them all together and putting them all in the same place at the same time in order that the sum total of what they can contribute individually will be seen to be greater, as I have no doubt will be the case.<\/p><p> In January of this year, I requested an urgent reappraisal of what was required, as our guests might recall.  At the time, Mr. Watt indicated he would tell us in November or December what might be possible, but it is too late for that.  That is way off and I think that, on reflection, he will have to admit that himself.  The necessity was to look at the issues that were now pertinent to the realm of the Department, and if we do not do that, we will be seen to have been negligent.  That is what future generations will say.  They will know full well that we have the capacity to take the steps that are expected of us, by whom I mean everybody involved at every level, from the public service, the political service and all that goes with that.  <\/p><p> As has been mentioned, lessons have been learned, but we have heard that phrase many times previously.  Why would it not have been possible to take account of the advice of committee members, for example?  We all had the feeling that we needed to divert our attention to the delivery of health services and put in place the necessary foundations for doing that straight away, not next November, December or the year after next but now?  It would be a simple step to take at this level and that needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p> I am sorry the reputations of many great contributors in the course of the pandemic have suffered, given it has been presented as though the system was doing something wrong.<\/p><p>The system was not doing something wrong.  It was attempting to keep on board all of the people who had a major contribution to make and continue to do so.<\/p><p> Reference was made to Dr. Holohan perhaps being able to look at this again.  I know that is difficult and he has made his own decisions, as he is entitled to do.  Dr. Holohan has also shown that he is committed to the public health system.  More than ever before, the public health service badly needs the expertise, leadership, concern, devotion and dedication of people who have been on the front line, or any line, of the pandemic.  I ask Dr. Holohan to consider this in the context of what might follow, so as not to lose all the information gleaned and all the expertise that is ready to be tapped for the public or for research insofar as the public health system is concerned.  That would be a disaster.  I do not want to continue incessantly as most of what I was going to say has already been said.  I wanted to emphasise that particular point.<\/p><p> With regard to senior officials and proceeding, we need senior officials with flair and innovative tendencies in the public service and I compliment those among them who have those qualities.  It is vitally important, however, that anything done is conveyed at an earlier stage to the political heads of Departments.  These are the persons who are supposed to know, and when they go on the public stage to discuss a particular subject they are entitled to have all of the information at their fingertips.  They need to be in control.  If they do not get information from the system in which they serve, they are no longer in control and they are boxing in the dark.  That does not work.  I hope that lesson has been learned and that with any such attempt in future not only will a letter or email be sent to the relevant people to apprise them of the particular situation, but that a copy will also be sent to whomever else might be involved.<\/p><p> I appeal to all concerned to think again about the position we are in now and the urgency of the matters that are ahead for the Department of Health and the health services.  We talk about this all the time.  It is not something we should refer to only for discussion.  We need action and the action can only come when the expertise, dedication and involvement of those dealing with the pandemic is refocused on the general delivery of health services, in particular the public health services.  That is all I want to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#Q01900","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1107,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan for that.  Now that we are through the latest wave of Covid, our focus is on the absolute public health needs, and particularly waiting lists.  We have an enormous challenge now because of the backlog of treatments.  We need to do everything we can.<\/p> <p>  I will mention two points.  There is a need to galvanise the system in dealing with challenges we now face, the more systemic challenge in the system.  We must galvanise the system in the way we managed to galvanise the system in responding to Covid.  That is very important.  People are suffering because they are waiting too long for treatment in many cases.  We need to have that same can-do spirit and the flair the Deputy mentioned is needed in that context.<\/p> <p>  My second point, to which the Chief Medical Officer has alluded, is that while the CMO is the public face of our response to the pandemic, along with Dr. Glynn at times, it is a team of people, including people in our Department, the HSE, the Department of the Taoiseach and many other Departments.  By the nature of it, someone has to lead that team and, in the case of a pandemic, someone had to be the public face.  It is very important to re-emphasise what the CMO said about many people being involved who, in my view, did a great service over the past years.  I thank Deputy Durkan for his comments in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The key thing now is for us to focus on what we must do for the health system to address the challenges.

If so, what actions need to be taken either by Mr. Watt, as the Secretary General of the Department, or the Minister?  What actions will be required going forward?  It seems to be that this is rumbling on.  As highlighted, a huge amount of work has been done around Covid and in light of the global situation things happened.  However, over the past while, a couple of things have happened that are eroding people's trust.  At a time when we are still in a global pandemic and we still have arguably a healthcare crisis, the erosion of public trust in the system is not ideal.

I have not seen the latest data.  I think, generally, people do trust the health system.  They do respect the health system.  There are issues around access, but once they have access, they express very strong positivity around the service they receive.  In terms of the Department of Health, I would certainly be very proud of what the Department has delivered over the last number of years in incredibly difficult circumstances.  I think officials of the Department can be very proud of what they have achieved in navigating us through this crisis.  By its nature, there are always issues in health.  I do not listen to radio but I am told that on most mornings, of the first five or six items on \"Morning Ireland\", close to half, or the majority, are health issues.  The nature of health is the nature of the system that we have.  It is a vast Department.  The health system is by far the biggest provider of a service by the State to our citizens.  It affects all of us.  All of our families have been affected.  As we all know, at various stages in our lives, we have to access the health system and at a time which could be most distressing for us.<\/p><p>It is a very challenging and emotive place and it is very contested.

That is what I do.  We try not to get distracted by other things that can be somewhat extraneous, ultimately.  We try to focus on getting the Department in the best possible shape and focusing on the big policy challenge over recent years, which was the pandemic.  We have a challenge now to prepare for the emergency department situation that we will face next winter, no doubt.  We also have issues around waiting lists, which Deputy Durkan touched on earlier.  That is our focus and what we do.  I do not think it is possible or realistic to expect that health will not be in the headlines or that there will not be issues and things thrown in our direction.

I just find it hard to believe there was no informal conversation saying, \"This proposal has come up and we are trying to facilitate it this way, there is a precedent in terms of Secretary Generals and I think it would be appropriate to use that model in terms of the deputy Secretary General.\"  Otherwise, I can see the model that was followed.

A request was made by the CMO.  The Secretary General decided to act on it.  The model is not unknown.  There is precedent in that it is actually provided for in terms of Secretary Generals.  It is not unprecedented that a person is funded by the State outside of and beyond their role until they reach their 40 years or retirement age or whatever.

I am only a guest of the committee.  I thank the witnesses for being here and the opportunity to make a few points and put a few questions.<\/p> <p>  There is some history here but at the outset I say that I have the height of respect for the Secretary General, Mr. Watt.  We have a history of spats at the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees but if I were in the private sector and part of a company large enough to afford Mr. Watt, I would certainly want him on my board.  However, we are not in the private sector and that is where much of the difference is evident.  I am a democracy purist.  Once, at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, I raised the question of wastage of &euro;10 million because of an error by the Office of Public Works with the rent of the Department of Health.<\/p><p>It would cost &euro;10 million over the course of the lease.  My question was whether there was a disciplinary process afoot.  Mr. Watt was then in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  He said he did not know but that a \"gotcha\" culture did not operate in the Civil Service and these things were used as a learning experience.  I thought that was a very expensive learning experience.  If it was in auctioneering, say, Jones Lang LaSalle, you would probably not get as far as lunchtime.<\/p><p> Before I get into my questioning, I will say that because something is the practice, it does not make it correct.  It does not make it morally correct in the interest of taxpayers' money.

How can Mr. Watt reconcile that with the idea of an open-ended term?  The CMO has very kindly pointed out he is a good distance from his 40 years.  Therefore, on top of proposing funding of &euro;2 million per year, Mr. Watt was in effect proposing that should the CMO opt to retire in the interim &mdash; say, after five or six years &mdash; he would, under the special clause in the superannuation Act, bump up the 27 or 28 years to 40.

I understand that the committee wishes to focus upon the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA.  To assist me in dealing with members' subsequent questions I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO with the authority.  Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the NTA must review its transport strategy every six years.  Arising from the review of the 2016 plan, an updated strategy has been developed which sets out the framework for investment in transport infrastructure and services over the next two decades to 2042.  This Draft Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2022-2042 replaces the previous framework, titled the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035, which was approved by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2016.<\/p> <p>  That prior transport strategy set out to contribute to the economic, social and cultural progress of the GDA by providing for the efficient, effective and sustainable movement of people and goods.  It did that by providing a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA.  It has also provided a transport planning policy around which other agencies involved in land use planning, environmental protection, and delivery of other infrastructure could align their investment priorities.  It has been an essential component, along with investment programmes in other sectors, for the development of the GDA, which covers the counties of Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  Major projects provided for in the original strategy, which are at different stages of delivery included: Luas cross city; the reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel rail line; the ongoing roll-out of cycle tracks and greenways; Metrolink; the DART+ programme; and investment in bus priority and bus service improvements, BusConnects Dublin.  Any transport strategy will always be part of a larger picture of overall national policies that work towards a single set of overall objectives.  To a large extent, policies and objectives around issues such as land use, development, population distribution, investment, sustainability and climate action, for example, are determined by other State agencies and authorities, but must be fully reflected in any transport strategy.  As such, this transport strategy has been developed to be consistent with the spatial planning policies and objectives set out in the regional spatial and economic strategy, RSES, as adopted by the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, and finalised in January 2020.  These objectives, in turn, are consistent with the national planning framework and the national development plan, as set out in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p>  In developing the draft strategy the NTA established a number of committees that guided us during the development.  These included the public representatives&rsquo; advisory committee, which comprised 18 councillors across the region, including the mayor or chairperson of each of the seven county councils; the chairperson of each strategic policy committee for transport in each of the county councils; and four additional councillors representing the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly.  Over 20 detailed studies were completed to support the development of the draft transport strategy, all of which were published as part of the public consultation.  The draft transport strategy seeks to address all aspects of land-based transport within the greater Dublin area and sets out a variety of actions covering: planning for sustainable transport; integration and inclusion; walking, accessibility and public realm; cycling and personal mobility vehicles; public transport, including bus, Luas, metro and heavy rail; roads; traffic management and travel options; freight, delivery and servicing; and climate action management.  The main changes in the current draft compared with the previous strategy are: the new rail line to Navan; additional rail stations; design of additional Luas lines if demand increases for delivery post-2042; and removal of the eastern bypass.<\/p> <p>  There is now a legislative requirement that public bodies must take account of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 in the performance of their functions.  Specifically in relation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Act requires a total reduction of 51% in such emissions over the period to 2030, relative to a baseline of 2018.  This is a significant and challenging target, which will require fundamental changes in transport over the next decade.  Central to those changes will be the need to increase the proportion of travel by sustainable modes and reduce the level of usage of petrol and diesel powered vehicles.  While in overall terms, meeting climate targets will be challenging for transport, the picture for urban public transport is different.  The NTA and our contracted operators are already actively transitioning to low and zero emissions fleet with 280 plug-in battery electric hybrid double-decker buses now available for operation in Dublin, Limerick and Galway and the first plug-in battery electric zero emission double-decker bus is being delivered late this year.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is trialling three double deck hydrogen-fuelled zero emission buses on its Dublin commuter services.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has also placed the first order of battery electric DART fleet as part of the electrification of the commuter rail services under the DART+ programme.<\/p> <p>  While the provision of new and additional transport infrastructure and transport services will encourage and deliver increased movement by sustainable modes, such provision will be insufficient on its own to achieve the level of emissions reduction required by 2030.  Accordingly, additional demand management measures will need to be put in place to complement the additional transport provision, which is likely to include parking restraint; zonal charging; additional tolling; and road pricing and further vehicle electrification, or both.  The public consultation on the draft transport strategy has been completed.  The NTA received over 1,000 submissions.  This compares with a total of 155 submissions received during the preparation of the 2016 strategy.  The authority has assessed those submissions and is finalising the revised draft to submit for approval to the Minister for Transport.  That concludes my introductory statement.  I trust that I can answer any queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1382,"content":"<p>I will go to members.

I would say it is not appropriate to amend that process at the moment.  If the Deputy thinks about it in the following terms, we have to have a statutory basis to submit a plan to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it is the new strategy that gives us that basis and it is not adopted yet.  We are currently working off the old strategy.  Having said that, putting in the extra infrastructure that is needed to run electric trains - if we can make it operationally work as far as Wicklow - is not a big task.  In reality, it probably only requires a charging system at Wicklow station.  There are operational challenges around making sure the train you want to extend to Wicklow is one with batteries on it as opposed to just pure electric.  That is an operational challenge we will have to tease out with Irish Rail.<\/p> <p>  I would be reluctant to say it should be included in the railway order.  I am much more comfortable in saying that it should be progressed as a parallel, separate project.  It is a relatively small project that could be delivered in parallel.  Therefore, including it or not does not necessarily impact the timeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1412,"content":"<p>Sure.  If this strategy is approved by the Minister, and I would expect electrification to Wicklow will be included in an approved strategy, it would make sense at design stage to include whatever might be necessary, because there may be some requirement for some planning process to put in a charging system at Wicklow.  I appreciate, and agree with Mr. Creegan, that it is a small enough task.  Even full electrification to Wicklow, in terms of overhead, would be quite a small price tag compared to other transport projects.  However, I would ask Mr. Creegan to consider whether it is sensible at this stage of going for design to include those aspects for Wicklow in it, because obviously the extension to Wicklow makes a lot of sense financially and environmentally and in serving an area that is identified on the regional spatial strategy.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to BusConnects.  Obviously, that is a vital part of the transport strategy for Dublin.  It is much needed and I very much support it and the very long public consultation over the past couple of years.  It was very in depth and a good example of a public consultation process, where some of the considerations were taken on board and it was tweaked.  I think most people are satisfied with many aspects of it.<\/p> <p>  One aspect for which I have looked for a long time are these circulatory bus services around towns.  I noticed the NTA proposed a bus for Bray and for Greystones to circulate those towns.  That is important as well, because we know many of these car journeys in towns are these short kind of shopping trips where a bus could provide that service.  The last notification I got was that those two routes were to be delivered under phase 7, to be launched in 2023.  Is that service just dependent on the new stock arriving?  That new stock will be single-deck, I presume.  Will it be electric or has that not been decided yet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#D00900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1413,"content":"<p>On the phases, BusConnects is too big to deliver in one single phase, so it has to be staggered.

That is the real reason the addition of the circulatory services around Greystones and Bray are included in a phase.  We will get to that phase as soon as we get the earlier ones completed.  It is not necessarily that the stock is holding up or anything else.  It is simply that the amount of work involved in timetabling and doing all the communications and everything else that needs to be done mean that it needs to be done incrementally.  A plan was worked out and the phase, which is probably the one the Deputy mentioned, will be got to in sequence.<\/p> <p>  On the buses, I am not sure yet what the buses will be.  There will have to a proofing exercise done on the route.  It could be because they are relatively short routes that single deck will be sufficient, in which case, I suspect depending on where we are with the depot electrification, it could be electric vehicles.  It just a little too early for us to be definitive on it yet.  We have a policy in place and we are transitioning over to fully electric fleet.  We have contracts in place to purchase single-deck electric and double-deck electric.  All the urban buses coming in from now on will be fully electric buses.

I should stop now.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of confusion and angst with regard to where we are with MetroLink and the Luas upgrade, both from people in places that have services and who want them to be better and from people in places that do not have services but who would like them.  People almost seem to be competing with each other for funds, which they see as a scarce resource.  There seems to be quite a bit of confusion and a lack of clarity with regard to the metro.  The Dublin Commuter Coalition has said that the southbound Luas upgrade should never have been abandoned and should continue at least as far as Sandyford, if not Cherrywood.  The Metro South West action group, which our witnesses will be very familiar with, are also campaigning.  I do not like to see this as an either-or scenario.  Both areas deserve public transport capacity.  If the Luas has shown us anything - and I was lucky enough to have been a councillor at the time and to have been on the very first Luas service from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green on the day of its launch in 2004 - it is that, if you build it, they will come.  The modal shift has taken place in Dundrum to such a degree that many of the bus routes that went through Dundrum, such as the 48A, were abandoned and scrapped because they were no longer necessary.  The Luas line acts as a magnet.  People are willing to walk those ten, 12 or 15 minutes because they know what awaits them once they get there.  It is an absolute credit to everybody involved with the Luas, including the Railway Procurement Agency, which has since been absorbed into TII, the NTA and so on.  Everybody else now wants a Luas, which is a challenge.  There are not necessarily corridors available for a Luas everywhere but that is where metro and underground services come in.<\/p> <p>  I am often asked why the upgrade is to stop at Charlemont rather than at Stephen's Green.  Why bring it that far and stop rather than going to a more central location in the city?  I am sure some of my colleagues will come in on this as well.  I am looking at a live application for permission to build 881 apartments on a single site at the old Dundrum Village Centre.  There is an endless amount of development happening at Cherrywood and very significant development in Sandyford.  That is before considering the mental hospital site, 700 student apartments to be built on the Goatstown Road and other developments.  There is an enormous amount of development happening on the existing Luas green line.  <\/p> <p>  There is also an enormous amount of development happening in Terenure, Harold's Cross and out towards Knocklyon and Firhouse.  People there have the red line far away from them on one side and the green line far away on the other but there is very little between outside of BusConnects.  BusConnects has a place but it does not have the same reliability of journey time and never can unless there are dedicated bus corridors.  The 46A, which has the best bus corridor in the country - I was lucky enough to be a councillor representing an area covering a long stretch of that corridor from Cabinteely as far as Belfield - is a very good service but fares must be taken and other things happen on roads that do not generally happen on railway lines.  <\/p> <p>  The Dublin Commuter Coalition's opening statement, which is to be delivered later and which the witnesses may or may not have seen, indicates that this plan is less ambitious than the last plan.  It has played down what was being offered under the last plan.  We are talking about Luas upgrades in 2042.  Before the pandemic, the green line was full.  If it was full before all of this development in Sandyford, Cherrywood and Dundrum is done, it will be much worse when those developments are complete if people are willing to use public transport.  People want to use public transport but, if it is not available or if it is full, they will get back in their cars.  What is happening with regard to Charlemont and why?  Why is there less ambition now that before?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#E00800","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1426,"content":"<p>I will start and then maybe my colleague will join in.

We need to change modalities and ensure that this works and that we have an efficient public transport system, especially in Dublin city.<\/p> <p>  I come from an older residential area with a particular need.  According to the opening statement, the NTA is charged with four actions: the efficient, effective and sustainable movement of people and goods; ensuring sustainability under our climate commitments; considering all methods of transport; and engaging in public consultation.  The draft transport strategy was published on 9 November 2021.  Its executive summary consists of 46 pages, the strategy itself is 224 pages long and there are 25 supporting documents, not counting the three impact assessments.  The portal for consultation opened on 9 November, ran over Christmas and closed on 10 January.  This was during Covid and times of restrictions on public meetings.  It was available online and presupposed that everyone had access to a computer and was literate enough to navigate his or her way through all of that documentation.<\/p> <p>  Of the 25 documents, the Dublin South-West study is 64 pages long.  It notes low bus speeds and proposes a solution to that issue.  I wish to address the area comprising Fortfield Park and Fortfield Road.  The recommendation for this area is that parking on the road be restricted as a solution to low bus speeds.  This is understood to mean that there will be a ban on parking.  The 54A bus route travels along both roads and runs twice per hour.  That will increase to four services per hour at normal times &ndash; with inward and outward journeys, this means eight journeys &ndash; and six services per hour at peak times, or 12 journeys.  The report does not take cognisance of the four schools in the immediate vicinity &ndash; they have a much wider catchment area &ndash; that do not have direct bus connectivity or that the combined number of students and staff is 2,500.  There was a failure to notify residents, shops and schools of the fact that their lives would change if these traffic restrictions were imposed.  The report failed to take cognisance of the health and safety of the children and the parents and guardians accompanying younger children to school.  The residents' quality of life will be undermined, but they are blissfully unaware of it.  The consultation period closed without many of them being aware because there was such a drowning of documentation.  In a document like this one, the same thing is repeated four times.  I have marked it.<\/p><p>Finding the level of detail for their road took a forensic mind, and some of us were fortunate to have access to such a resource in Mr. Brendan Heneghan.<\/p><p> There is another aspect to climate consciousness.  In the Dublin South-Central constituency, we also have Ceannt Fort, a residential area that is one of the oldest estates in the city.  There are 202 houses on the estate.  As a consequence of the bus gate on the Old Kilmainham Road, when they drive out of their estate, people will not be able to turn left.  They will be obliged to turn right or else detour through the new children's hospital or St. James's Hospital.  There is no accommodation for local access proposals, such as an exemption or a sticker or something.  The bus gate is proposed to operate 24-7 but that will not happen in practice.  As it is in other areas, the 24-7 provision is an excessive response.<\/p><p> Chapelizod is a community without a secondary school.  People there commute to schools in Lucan and Leixlip.  Many of the residents rely on the post office and banks in Ballyfermot.  There are a number of disability residential providers within Chapelizod.  There is significant inward and outward traffic.  Last November, when the C spine came into being, the connectivity between Chapelizod and Lucan and Leixlip was removed and people now have to take two buses.  The consequence of that, as estimated by some of the local residents, is that car journeys have increased by 170 per week.<\/p><p> There was no entertainment of metro south-west; it was dismissed out of hand.  There are areas of Terenure and Templeogue that are caught between three bus corridors and all traffic will be driven down very narrow residential areas.  Unlike the experience of my colleague, public consultation in the area has been woefully absent.  I accept that there have been meetings with some public representatives, but measures to ensure that the public can realise the sheer impact of the change in their lives are woefully absent.  If we are talking about ensuring efficient, effective and sustainable movement of people and goods, the result of what will happen at Ceannt Fort, and that has already happened in Chapelizod, will be an increase in the number of car journeys rather than a reduction.<\/p><p> I would like the response of the witnesses to this.  Will there still be an opportunity to have an impact or see change in this?  There is much disillusionment in the area because people want to support these measures but they are unable to because their voices are not necessarily being heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#G02800","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1502,"content":"<p>I will distinguish between the draft transport strategy we are talking about here, which is a very high-level document setting out the proposals at a very high level with regard to delivery of sustainable transport infrastructure to improve people's movements and reduce carbon emissions.

It is nice to meet Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan again in person.  I am looking at the strategy and I will start with chapter 13 on roads, which outlines the strategic importance of the M50 and M50 resilience and it identifies the lack of adequate resilience between junctions 6 and 7, which is the location of the M50 toll bridge from Lucan to Blanchardstown, in the event of accidents.  The objective in the strategy document states, \"The NTA, in collaboration with TII and the relevant local authorities, will seek the development and construction of an appropriate road link between the N3 and N4 national roads, which can provide a satisfactory alternative in the event of incidents arising on the M50 between Junctions 6 and 7, in addition to providing potential additional public transport linkages.\"  I would like to know where that project is and what local authorities are involved.  TII has already identified 11 possible routes and those are the routes the NTA will make a decision on when identifying a preferred route.  Are the witnesses aware that eight of those routes go through the special amenity area of the Liffey Valley and that they would devastate green spaces, protected areas and heritage sites such as Porterstown Park in Dublin 15, Shackleton Mill, St. Catherine's Park in Lucan and Leixlip and the St. Edmundsbury lands?  Will that be taken into consideration in the decision on an emerging preferred route?  The objective relates to M50 resilience only and it says nothing about the unsafe and unsustainable traffic that rolls through Lucan village every day from 4 p.m. and from 12 noon at the weekends.  Will this process of identifying a route take on board issues other than M50 resilience, such as the fact that eight of those routes would be completely unacceptable?  Will the process form part of a transport strategy for Lucan village?<\/p> <p>  I refer to public transport and orbital transport in this area, which are not effective.  We are talking about an hourly bus.  There was the 239 route, which used to go from Blanchardstown Centre to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre but that has been cut in two.  The bus only comes every hour now and BusConnects means that to get a bus into town people from my area of Lucan north have to walk kilometres to get to Lucan Road because they cannot rely on that hourly bus down Laraghcon Hill and they have to walk further as the 25 is not coming from Main St. in Lucan.  The new pedestrian and cycleway bridge as part of the canal loop project is on hold so pedestrians do not have safe passage or cycling over Lucan bridge.<\/p> <p>  The GDA cycle network was part of the strategy.  Did it get enough feedback through the consultation and did enough people know about it?  Part of the Liffey Valley greenway was dropped as a specific objective.  There are elements of routes still in place but they are pared back and there is a reduction in bridges crossing the Liffey.  As a greenway on the Liffey Valley would be an exceptional amenity for Dublin, I am suggesting that it be reinstated and it could potentially be a spur on the canal loop greenway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#J03100","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1576,"content":"<p>The witnesses will have to respond within the Senator's time as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#J03200","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1577,"content":"<p>I know; I will be quick.  I refer to the DART+ West consultation process for Ashtown.  As part of public consultation 2, 6,340 out of 8,000 submissions related to Ashtown Stables because the proposals in public consultation 2 would have devastated Ashtown Stables.  There has been another consultation and the document for it states: &quot;This revised preferred option largely avoids Ashtown Stables, which was identified as an important local community amenity&quot;.  On page 60 the public consultation report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBy relocating the roadway to the west of the mill much of the impact on the stables is removed.

Ashtown Stables says that those drawings render the business unviable, that there is a significant contradiction, that there are no measurements, that it impacts Mill Lane and Ashtown Road and that it conflates permanent and temporary land takes.  This is a real worry for us.  The community came together to support this family business and now it tells us when the consultation is finished that the solutions we thought we had found were not there.  The owners of Ashtown Stables are incredibly upset about this.  Is this how Irish Rail treats family businesses?  Are the witnesses aware of this?

With regard to where the project sits now, a feasibility study was done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland and we were involved with that some three years ago.  I had thought it was 12 routes that were identified as possibilities, but perhaps the Senator is correct that it is 11.  The project has not gone any further yet.  At a point in time, if this strategy is adopted, the project needs to be developed as a stand-alone project.  It needs to evaluate all of those options and maybe others.  It needs to consider all of the things the Senator has mentioned such as environmental impacts, the impacts on the various parks and so on.  I have heard from lots of the people out there about some of the options.  Out of that, it has to come up with a preferred option as part of the project itself.  That is the project as opposed to the strategy.  As of now, nothing is currently happening on it.  I believe it should happen in the next year or two, but nothing is currently happening.  It would need to be done in conjunction with South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council.  I believe that some of the options go out into Kildare also so a number of local authorities will be involved in it.  That is the status now.  The feasibility study was done a number of years ago, there is a statement in the transport strategy, and currently nothing else is happening on it, to the best of my knowledge.<\/p> <p>  I will jump now to the greater Dublin area cycle network.  We got plenty of feedback on the cycle network.  It is fair to say that we had errors in our network.  We had not brought in some of the key things from the previous version of the network that we had.  That is being corrected now.  I do not recall what it is we have done on the Liffey Valley greenway.  I am not sure, but I believe we have actually revisited that and put back in things that we had planned previously.  We certainly got plenty of feedback and, hands up, we had some of the details wrong.  The final network will be much more comprehensive and will pick up a lot of the faults that people have identified.<\/p> <p>  On the DART+ West and Ashtown Stables, I am reluctant to go too deep into that here because it is Irish Rail that is running the project.  We are very familiar with this and very aware of the issues.  A lot of effort was put into the final option that came forward to try to mitigate the impacts on Ashtown Stables.  It does affect another property there, as members may be aware.  The drawings, maps and various brochures that are produced are accurate drawings of the routes.  I do not know what was issued on the day before.  It may have been that the actual engineering drawings were issued.  I would be highly surprised if they were any different from the drawings that were published, and I do not believe they were.  Obviously, they would provide more detail about the exact measurements.  I am speculating that this is what was issued.  The norm would be to issue a simpler version of the drawings.  Most people do not want to get a bundle of engineering drawings to deal with.  They receive a much simpler version of the drawings so that people can understand the impact.  In my view, a lot of effort was made to mitigate the impact on Ashtown Stables.  I understand that they are not happy with it.  The feedback is now being reviewed by Irish Rail and final decisions still have to be made on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1582,"content":"<p>The National Transport Authority is aware of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#K00400","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1583,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1584,"content":"<p>On the orbital transport route 239 and the different issues around the Lucan services, the committee is aware that we implemented the C spine with all the other services associated with that.

This morning I received my copy of the BusConnects Cork - Sustainable Transport Corridors Report.  I appeal to Ms Graham today, in the context of the Dublin transport plan - and I have had extensive engagement with many councillors and was quite happy to have Senator Seery Kearney attend the committee today - that we would look at the submissions made by people on the ground regarding the Dublin bus plan.  It is about ensuring that we have a sustainable public transport system and that the final plan, subject to recommendations, should reflect on what the public consultation is about in terms of submissions made by people.  If one looks at what has been said already today, genuine concerns have been expressed.  I am aware that Mr. Brendan Heneghan has been in contact with the committee and I propose that we submit Mr. Heneghan's document, which he gave to me and to others on the committee, to Ms Graham for her consideration as part of the submission and as part of the public consultation.  I hope that the plan will look at the whole issue of fair discrepancies and at what the public consultation throws up.  The submissions made are done in the best way by members of the public, and by elected representatives, to ensure that we have a transport plan that is viable in our capital city.  From talking to many of my local authority members I am aware that they have concerns regarding parts of what is proposed.  I hope that this can be taken on board by Ms Graham and by others involved.  I thank the Acting Chairperson for the opportunity to speak today.  I hope that as part of the Cork BusConnects, we can have learnings from what is happening in Dublin, to facilitate and help the sustainable transport plan for Cork as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#K01400","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1593,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Buttimer.

It is to be commended.  I appreciate it and I use it myself.  The work being done there is great but there is a lot more potential.  There are plenty of people out there.  I did not cycle for years and years, and then I went back to it.  Now I use it more often that I use my car.  While not millions, there are certainly tens or hundreds of thousands of people in Dublin who have not cycled a bike since they were in school, if even then.  If they were encouraged to borrow a bike or had the use of a bike to start using these facilities they would be better off.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is now back.

I have a couple of comments and questions around commuter fares, BusConnects, and trains in my constituency.  I absolutely welcome the new fare structure and how seamless the new 90-minute fare has been between the different transport modes.  It is hugely progressive and hugely positive.  It is great to see further reductions now coming down the tracks, if you will excuse the pun, this month.  I believe they are due to happen in May.  My concern is that commuters are not necessarily seeing this fare reduction.  At the moment one can buy a TaxSaver ticket for &euro;1,150.  If one was using public transport to get to and from work five days per week every working day, this would equate to &euro;23.96 per week.  This is 20% more than if one was using the TFI Leap card for two trips five days per week under the new 90-minute fare option. While the TFI Leap card is going to be more suitable for people who are still returning to the office on a phased basis or for those who are working hybrid, it means they are not getting that tax efficiency that is baked into the TaxSaver ticket policy, and which is Government policy to provide.  Is this an anomaly that might be rectified or are there any plans from this perspective?<\/p><p>As for BusConnects, the C spine is up and running in Lucan and it was a big change for all of us there.  While there are a number of areas where there have been concerns, by and large the routes are working quite well, especially the late-night route given there is a taxi shortage.  However, there are underserved areas and that is a fundamental concern of mine.  There is no direct link to the city centre from areas that had one prior to BusConnects.  Hillcrest and Doddsborough are two such areas.  That is not progressive but regressive as they used to have a service but it is now gone.  Senator Currie and I had a number of meetings with representatives from the NTA and while they were very welcome it was not really meaningful engagement because nothing has changed as a result of them.  People in those areas still are not served properly by a bus service.  Neither are people who were promised the W8 this year, which I understand has been further delayed.  That would be hugely welcome to people working in areas like Greenogue or Citywest or people from Saggart, Newcastle or Rathcoole intending to go to college in Maynooth.<\/p><p> On the trains, I am looking for a quick update on when the trains through Adamstown-Hazelhatch will be electrified.  I am aware the NTA and the Minister are sick to their back teeth of answering this question from me but why is Kishoge train station still not open?  It is there, it is built and it is working.  It even has a car park.  It could be used to serve people in what is a growing area but it is still not open.  My final question on trains is on Hazelhatch train station which is not walking distance for many commuters, unfortunately.  Most people must drive to get there or perhaps cycle.  Could we look at making it a bit more of a cycle-friendly station?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#K01600","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1597,"content":"<p>I will hand over to my colleague first and then pick up on other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1598,"content":"<p>Go ahead Mr. Creegan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#L00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1599,"content":"<p>On when the electric train service to Adamstown will be provided, it is a few years away yet.

It may be possible to do something with battery-electric fleet earlier but I am not too sure.<\/p> <p>  Kishoge station is a long-running saga.  We thought it would be open by now, to be fully transparent with the Deputy, but a survey showed because it was built almost 12 years ago major remedial works turned out to be required.  Irish Rail is organising those remedial works to the building structure.  It does not meet current accessibility codes and things like that.  That work must be done and is going to be done this year and I think it runs into next year.  At that stage we can open it.  It was news to us such an amount of upgrading was required but it genuinely was.  It is now being funded and is happening.  When it is complete we have to open that station.<\/p> <p>  On Hazelhatch station, it is worth knowing that on the C spine there are a number of services we put in that actually connect to that to make it more useful.

It was a very significant change in the Dublin fares.  It was pitched at &euro;2.30 at that time as a reduction.  It will be &euro;2.50 normally.  However, with the Government's introduction of the 20% reduction that is now going to be &euro;2 from this weekend.  That represents really good value.  It calls into question whether there is value associated with taxsaver in some cases, depending on what number of journeys you are now doing as a commuter.  The value is in that 90-minute ticket and would allow you to use all modes for that price.  Beside that, the taxsaver tickets have also been subject to the 20% reduction in fares introduced on 1 April.  Existing taxsaver users have an extension if they bought their ticket earlier this year.  They get a three-month extension.  As I said earlier, that is to allow us a bit of time to see if we can find a solution, which is not easily done on the infrastructure we have, that allows for a two-day or three-day type taxsaver ticket.  That is not available at the moment and we are finding it difficult to be able to provide that, especially on the rail services where we need a facility to be able to decrement a day's travel on an annual ticket.

I have two questions.  One is around modal share and the other is on climate targets within the strategy.  On the first question, the Cathaoirleach and myself are familiar with coming from Heuston Station on a Tuesday morning and going back there on a Thursday evening, generally.  We have seen huge improvements along the quays in the form of reallocation of road space and provision of segregated cycle lanes.  Anecdotally, that has led to much increased cycling along the quays and is certainly a success story for Dublin City Council and the NTA in the last two years.  If we provide this infrastructure we will easily reach the modal shift targets in the strategy.  We should therefore be pushing way beyond the targets that are there.  I think we are going to go from 4% in 2016 to 12% in 2042.  That is a very modest increase given we know when segregated infrastructure is provided everybody aged between eight years and 80 years is inclined to cycle more.<\/p> <p>  The current approach seems to be to develop our networks in quite a piecemeal way rather than in a more aggressive and radical way.  It seems to me the strategy should have an approach of developing much more than is currently there.  Nationwide, we are looking at about 1,000 km in the next five years but we could do much more than that given the approach we have seen during Covid.  I would like the NTA officials to comment on that.  I certainly urge them to review the modal share for cycling in particular and to address road space reallocation.  There are very few references to that in the 250 or so pages of the strategy.  If we are to get people onto buses, bikes and get them walking as well we must get serious about it and the strategy must be serious about it.  I acknowledge it is a high-level document but if we are putting in those targets they need to be ambitious ones.  There is reference in the strategy to demand-management measures but the officials have said a few times it is a high-level document so those measures are not in the strategy.  Does the authority propose to develop those, put them into the strategy and put them out to public consultation?  What kind of demand-management measures should we be expecting to see?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the carbon emission reduction targets.  The strategy concedes they do not align with the national goal of reducing emissions by 51% by 2030.<\/p><p>In 2018 there were 3.2 mega tonnes.  With this strategy, we will get to approximately 2 mega tonnes by 2030.  This is not quite 51%.  That is the nationwide target.  Is it the case that the NTA sees that there is less room for cutting emissions in Dublin and therefore more emissions will have be reduced outside of Dublin, to align with the 51% target in the transport sector nationwide?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#L01100","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1608,"content":"<p>Just to clarify, we do not set targets within the strategy.  We try to assess at the end of all of the strategy interventions what the likely outcomes will be.  That is the mode share that one is seeing there.  When it came to the cycling mode share, we developed sophisticated transport models.  However, the transport models that we use are based upon existing developed practice.  When it comes to cycling here in Ireland, we do not have great networks.  Therefore, the existing practice does not fully reflect the potential, as the Deputy said.  Over the last few months since the strategy was published, we have refined our models to try to take account of that potential that safe segregated facilities will give.  We will see in the final strategy that the mode share for cycling is much higher.  From memory, beside the canals it is about 20%.  It is well into the teens across the Dublin region.  That is much higher than it is now.  That reflects a refinement of our modelling processes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of developing the cycling network, we entirely agree  with the Deputy.  Piecemeal development and unconnected cycling routes do not deliver anything.  It needs to be a coherent network.  We have developed plans that are subsets of overall strategies for what needs to be put in place over the next number of years.  This is where the 1,000 km figure, which the Deputy mentioned, comes from.

First, I welcome the witnesses who are before the committee.  Although I am a Deputy from Cork East, I am also our party spokesperson on transport.  The importance that Dublin and the region around Dublin has for our entire economy must be recognised.<\/p> <p>  In the Dublin area, the huge dependency on cars sticks out to me as someone who commutes in and out of Dublin twice a week.  Somebody like me, for example, wants to get in and out of Dublin swiftly.  That is also the case for anybody who has normal working hours.  Unfortunately, for hundreds of thousands of people who are working in the greater Dublin area, a car is the only way to get in and out of work.  There is no real alternative when it comes to time saving.  That is predominantly to do with the fact that the inter-city speed on train lines is too slow.  Another issue is the capacity of the rate system.  There is much work ongoing on that at the moment.  <\/p> <p>  When one looks at the road infrastructure around Dublin, such as at the M1, M2, the N7 and the arterial roads coming up from Wicklow, I want to make the point that we have to do a huge body of work to reduce the dependency and to create proper alternatives for people who do not want to drive into the city centre in their car.  If I was using the N7, just like commuters coming in from the direction of Limerick, Cork, Tipperary, Kilkenny, Waterford and Carlow, and felt I was able to park my car and get into Heuston Station in a relatively decent amount of time, I and many other people would do so.  I would openly question whether there is enough joined-up thinking happening.  This is the case in other parts of the country with metropolitan strategies that have been put in place.  I promise that there is a question coming.  Is enough being done to provide park-and-ride capacity to get cars off the motorway for those of us who are not going to be able to hop on a bus outside of our door, so that we can get to Dublin?  Is enough being done to have that modal shift in journeys, so that people can park their car outside the city centres, effectively freeing up streets in places like Dublin for further work to be done on mobility, walking and cycling infrastructure?  This is being done really successfully in some other European cities.  Paris, for example, is fantastic in the work that it is continuing to do.  Although it is quite painful for people who are driving cars and even buses now in the city, it is becoming a really friendly city for pedestrians and for cycling.

It would be a floor platform in the sense that people would be able to walk to, perhaps, a new station that could be built and would not impact necessarily on the line capacity as much as a direct rail connection.  It is really difficult for me to see how all of these services are going to be delivered.  In all of my engagements with the NTA, TII, the Department of Transport and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform I have found it extraordinarily frustrating to get an accurate picture of what is going on.  We need to tidy up in that regard if we are serious about increasing the number of people using public transport in this country and about increasing mobility of our streets, on which good work has been done by the NTA.

The 3,600 strong team in Dublin Bus and I are in the business of contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.  That is important because we are ambitious to have integrated public policy and better outcomes for the people of Dublin.  This means we need to start thinking now about Dublin&rsquo;s transport future. The prospects are good but only if we plan ahead.  At the heart of this, for us in public transport, is the vitally important greater Dublin area transport strategy.<\/p> <p>  Public transport, as we all know, is key to the sustainable development of Ireland and the continued economic prosperity of our people.  Our buses are more than just a means of transporting people across the capital; they are vital to creating connected communities with good amenities and good jobs.  The centrality of public transport to our lives and the success of our country means we need to broaden the conversation on transport policy so I welcome the opportunity to appear today.<\/p> <p>  Before casting an eye to the future, it is important to highlight the progress made in recent years.  Over the past seven years, we have reinvented, strengthened, and modernised our services, and our company.  We have been independently recognised as Ireland&rsquo;s best indigenous employer.  Customer numbers have gone from 122 million to a pre-pandemic high of 139 million in 2019.  Today, the company is Ireland&rsquo;s largest public transport provider.  We carried 70 million customers in 2021, and we hope to get back to more than 150 million customers travelling per year as our society recovers from the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  With the introduction of five new 24-7 routes alongside our Nitelink services, we have begun the process of introducing all-day and all-night services across the capital.  We have done all this while facing the most difficult of headwinds in the form of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and the challenges posed by Brexit.  I take this opportunity to recognise the commitment and skill of the Dublin Bus team, which is vital to our success.  Whether they work maintaining, driving or cleaning our buses or working on our customer support teams, we would not be able to run high-quality bus services without them.  This progress has, of course, been achieved in co-operation with the NTA and Government.  In our submission to the NTA, we focused on: the full delivery of the BusConnects project; the delivery of sustainable bus services which meets climate change requirements; the future when it comes to technology and new customer offerings; and short- to medium-term improvements to bus services and the broader operating environment.  Focusing on these goals provides the opportunity for us all to pull together and play our part so that we can secure the gains which have been the achievement of thousands of workers across the public transport industry.<\/p> <p>  Key to building on our recent progress is the BusConnects project.  It is a key part of the GDA transport strategy to improve public transport and address climate change in Dublin and other cities.  Dublin Bus is assisting the NTA with the implementation of the BusConnects Dublin area network redesign.  We have successfully implemented phases 1 and 2 of the network redesign.  We look forward to assisting the NTA with phase 3 in the coming weeks and with phases 4 and 5 in the second half of 2022.<\/p> <p>  The successful delivery of BusConnects is vital to the future of Dublin Bus and is also critical to the achieving the company&rsquo;s goal of being the State&rsquo;s delivery partner of choice.  The bus is the largest mode, and will remain so.  It is vital, therefore, that BusConnects is fully implemented during the 2022-2030 period.<\/p> <p>  On immediate measures to build support for public transport, our view is that a number of solutions could be put in place for the short to medium term which would improve urban bus public transport, the public realm, enhance the customer experience and increase the use of sustainable transport.  These measures will provide mobility to the many, for the benefit of all and will help build support for the GDA transport strategy.  They include: exploring additional bus-based projects; additional 24-7 services; and strengthening and protecting bus lane priority.<\/p> <p>  On exploring additional bus based projects, many of the service initiatives and infrastructure projects as part of the ambitious transport strategy for the GDA will take time to deliver.  The bus is the most cost-effective and flexible mass public transit service offering.  Encouraging customers to use public transport is a key requirement for a sustainable future.  In advance of new fixed rail lines or metro, investment should be focused on building public transport patronage on identified corridors and then migrating customers to the fixed rail or metro services.  Buses with high levels of service and demand-responsive transport, DRT, have a role to play and can be introduced in advance of rail-metro construction and realigned subsequently.  This will give significant benefits to communities long before the introduction of rail-based services.<\/p> <p>  On additional 24-7 services, there is a strong need for stakeholders from across society to work together.<\/p><p>Whether it is public health, climate change, economic modernisation or public transport, there is a growing expectation that businesses have a role to play in addressing broader economic and societal issues.  At the heart of this must be all partners working together to deliver a truly 24-hour Dublin.  High-quality 24-hour bus services are needed to deliver an all-day and all-night city.  It is our view, as stated in our report, that the broader economic needs of the city justify accelerating the introduction of 24-hour services on routes such as the 46A, 155 and many others.  This will allow operators and customers to build on the success of the existing 24-hour services 15, 39A, 41, C1 and C2, plus C5 and C6.<\/p><p> Over 30 years ago we introduced our first bus lane on Parliament Street.  That transformed bus services across the capital.  Those bus lanes need to be protected and improved.  When it comes to bus lane enhancement, we believe it is appropriate to move away from time-specific bus lanes and towards a 24-hour designation for all bus lanes on all days of the week.<\/p><p> Over the past two years there has been a significant increase in the number of people cycling.  This is good for Dublin.  Cycling makes our city quieter, more efficient and a nicer place to live.  People must be able to cycle safely in the capital.  Public transport companies like Dublin Bus and cyclists are natural allies in the fight for a more sustainable Dublin.  We have supported, and will continue to support, the introduction of appropriate cycling infrastructure across the GDA.<\/p><p> The pandemic period was a particularly tough one for businesses across the GDA.  A key question for Dublin Bus now is how we can help support economic recovery as normal activity levels resume.  We have a key role to play in public transport and bringing people into the city centre and other urban hubs across the GDA but we can also use our size and scale to make the GDA a nicer place to live, work and visit.  Over the last few months we have seen increasing pedestrianisation of streets, with Merrion Row and Capel Street being the most recent examples, and other public realms being changed or reclaimed for people and businesses.  Dublin Bus is supportive of this emerging trend.  We hope consensus is reached between all partners regarding the increased pedestrianisation of Capel Street and South William Street.  I think Capel Street has now been agreed.  These are just some short-term measures that could be used to help improve the customer experience and increase public transport usage, which we all know is vital to building a more sustainable Dublin.  If we do not take these steps, congestion will inevitably get worse, commute times will get longer and emissions will rise in line with population growth.<\/p><p> Over many years we have seen the benefits of embracing technology in our lives and businesses.  In its purest form, technology makes things easier to use and by design, better.  We have seen the benefits of technology in the transport industry over many years, leading to greater accessibility of our buses through access ramps, induction loops, audio announcements and colour contrasting interiors, as well as through the zero tailpipe emissions buses that are on order, traffic light priority for public transport and timely information for customers.  We are now at a point where the technology and transport industries are significantly integrating.  If we plan together and capture the benefits technology and transport can offer, we can facilitate modal shift and achieve our climate targets.<\/p><p> Short-term initiatives include the use of account-based ticketing using a token, which can be a smartphone, smart watch, debit card or QR code.  In March, the Government agreed funding to progress this under the next generation ticketing project as part of BusConnects.  Account-based ticketing will provide faster journey times and allows for dynamic pricing and demand management.  It will also provide a single payment system for the whole transport network and can give people the cheapest fare for the journey undertaken in real time.  Account-based ticketing can significantly simplify and enhance the customer experience and provides significant insights through data that can further benefit our customers.  It is also part of an emerging ecosystem called MaaS or mobility as a service.  This is next level integration, where a single payment system will allow multiple transport options to be selected on demand by use.  This would include bike shares, car shares, e-bikes, e-scooters, micro-mobility, taxis and public and private operators.<\/p><p> Technology will also provide a platform for enhanced reliability and efficiency of service provision through greater use of data, analytics and artificial intelligence.  Historically, traditional companies have not been imaginative enough with their assets and the benefits technology can bring.  There is an opportunity for Dublin Bus to further build on its reputation through the early adoption of new technology to create and capture value for our customers and the State.  Examples include the use of predictive maintenance to increase reliability and real-time capacity deployment to meet customer needs as they arise.<\/p><p> Technology is also an enabler for the sustainable development of our city by assisting with increased movements by way of an integrated multimodal transport system.  Many public transport users are also car users and there will always be a need for public and private modes in our cities.  We must ensure priority is given to high-capacity transport modes but that they work in harmony.  We need to achieve modal shift in an appropriately managed fashion.  This will require a consensus on the introduction of demand management principles in our city, which technology can facilitate.  Examples include fixed automatic number plate recognition; kerbside management services; bus-only roads, which would be time bound or congestion dependent as needed; dynamic road speeds for all vehicles; end-to-end priority for public transport modes; congestion charging; and the introduction of demand-responsive transit.  Many of these opportunities will require us to be both learners and leaders but I am confident that we are ready.  Dublin Bus is accelerating plans and working with partners to harness the potential of demand-responsive transit and other transport innovations.  It is my firm belief that the technology and innovations are there to deliver during the lifetime of the strategy, but only if consensus can be reached.<\/p><p> In a world that is changing before our very eyes, it is right that we think about and plan for the long term.  Dublin Bus believes that the NTA&rsquo;s ambitious GDA transport strategy will make a significant contribution to the economic, mobility and sustainability needs of a thriving, ambitious and progressive city.  The years up to 2042 will see us operate in an environment where economic and social development has a significant impact on the role of public transport.  Investing in transport is key to our continued economic growth and to delivering sustainable jobs now and in the future.  This means we, as advocates for a public transport and a better GDA, must be proactive in providing the city with modern, dynamic mobility solutions.  Dublin Bus is a solutions provider and it is in this spirit that we engaged with the strategy.  While there is no doubt that external factors will reshape our region, the GDA that emerges over the lifetime of this strategy must be more liveable and more sustainable.  To do this we must develop more liveable communities where businesses can flourish and people can use buses, bikes, e-scooters and their own feet to get around.<\/p><p> In the more immediate term, we must look at bus-based measures that will help the GDA recover from the economic impact of the pandemic and ward off the growing threat of congestion.  Now is not the time to place a limit on our ambition for transport in the GDA.  We must embrace technology as the means to removing the barriers to public transport.  The ability to easily pay for and use public transport will be essential if we are to attract people back to our services.  Beyond this, Dublin Bus believes that continued investment in public transport through BusConnects, combined with an increased willingness to accelerate many of the measures set out in the 2022-42 strategy, will transform the GDA.  That is the ultimate prize for investment in public transport and the creation of a successful GDA, which will be a better place to live, visit and work, not just a better public transport system.  I thank the committee for taking the time to listen and I am happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1652,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coyne.

I am chairperson of Dublin Commuter Coalition and I am joined today by Ms Janis Morrissey from our committee.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Commuter Coalition is a voluntary advocacy group established in 2018 to act as a unifying voice for sustainable transport users in the greater Dublin area.  Despite our name, we do not advocate just for commuters, but for everyone in the GDA who walks, cycles, scoots or uses public transport.  We represent the lived experiences of our members, from parents who want their children to walk or cycle to school independently to people who cross the city each day for work or college, and older citizens who need reliable and accessible connections to their local shops and to their friends and family.  Our vision is for Dublin to have a transport network that is safe, accessible, connected and sustainable.  We work to realise our vision through meetings with policymakers and engaging with public bodies, as well as by being a voice for sustainable transport in social and traditional media.<\/p> <p>  When we were founded, the future of transport in Dublin looked bleak.  There were very few public transport or active travel projects in progress and we spent most of our time countering objections and misinformation about what little was proposed.  In just over three years, this has changed dramatically.  The calls to strengthen public transport infrastructure have only grown louder as the climate crisis has become more urgent and the many benefits of sustainable transport are becoming more widely recognised.  We are pleased to see the roll-out of the new BusConnects network and the submission of planning applications for BusConnects core bus corridors.  For us, this is the culmination of over three years of advocacy on different strands of BusConnects.  The introduction of the new 90-minute fare, which enables free transfer between buses and rail services, maximises the utility of the existing network by making multistage journeys easier and significantly cheaper.  We are getting very positive feedback on this and we hope to see it expanded to more areas around Dublin.<\/p><p>We are also seeing a much greater appetite for safe active travel infrastructure and are pleased with the substantial increase in the planning and delivery of pedestrianised streets and segregated cycle routes.<\/p><p> On the GDA transport strategy, we have submitted our response to the public consultation on the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area as a briefing document for members of this committee.  During the initial public consultation, 90% of respondents stated the transport strategy should seek to reduce the reliance on private cars for travel in the GDA.  While the draft transport strategy gets a lot of things right, it is less progressive than the previous strategies at a time when Dublin people, and indeed our planet, demand the greatest ambition.  Our main concerns relate to the slow and vague timelines provided and the removal of two vital projects.  People in Dublin are increasingly frustrated with how long it takes to design, plan and build transport projects.  We believe the timelines for the delivery of projects in the draft transport strategy are far too slow.  Given Ireland's climate commitments and the growing demands to decrease air pollution, travel times and costly car dependency, we had hoped the NTA would seek to accelerate some of these projects.  However, we have seen no evidence of any accelerated delivery in the draft transport strategy.  For example, the sum total of the Luas lines proposed to have been built by 2042 in the draft transport strategy is the same as what was proposed to have been built by 2035 in the previous transport strategy, namely, a new line to Lucan and small extensions to Finglas, Poolbeg and Bray.<\/p><p> While we are concerned with how slow the projects are and the general lack of urgency, we are also concerned with the vague timelines given.  The draft transport strategy divides projects into two groups depending on when they are due to be finished, that is, whether from 2022 to 2030 or from 2031 to 2042.  Beyond this, it is not clear when the projects listed will be completed.  For example, the people of Navan were told their rail line would be finally built, but they do not know if that will be ten or 20 years from now.  It is difficult to bring communities along on these large projects with such vague timelines.  They do not instil any confidence in the projects themselves and people find it hard to believe they will ever be built.  A notable omission from the draft transport strategy is the DART+ tunnel, which was previously known as DART underground.  This project would completely transform the eastern rail network by connecting the Cork and Kildare line to the northern line, which stops in the heart of Dublin.  The previous transport strategy planned to have completed this crucial infrastructure before 2035, but the draft transport strategy postpones it for at least 20 years.  The delay exemplifies the lack of urgency and leadership evident throughout the document.  This year marks 50 years since the tunnel was first proposed.<\/p><p> The Luas green line between Charlemont and Sandyford was built with the intention it would be eventually upgraded from a tram to a metro.  The previous transport strategy proposed to link this high-capacity section of the Luas green line to the new high-capacity metro at Charlemont to create one long metro corridor from Swords to Sandyford, as originally intended, for relatively little additional cost.  Housing developments along this corridor already have been built on the promise this line will be upgraded, but this essential upgrade is now notably absent from the draft transport strategy.<\/p><p> We believe it is important to acknowledge the strategy is better than the previous one in some areas.  We welcome changes such as the extension of the DART to Sallins, Wicklow and Kilcock, the inclusion of the Navan rail line and the removal of the eastern bypass.<\/p><p> In conclusion, we believe the draft transport strategy falls well short of what is needed to facilitate the radical shift away from private cars to sustainable modes that is required to meet our climate commitments and reduce congestion, air pollution and inactivity.  We are seeking substantial changes to the plan before it has been finalised and approved by the Minister.  With greater ambition, the transport strategy can be a catalyst for change and Dublin can be a leader in the provision of safe, accessible and sustainable transport for all.  The people of the greater Dublin area demand and deserve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feljin Jose","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1655,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#Q00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1656,"content":"<p>My first questions are for Mr. Coyne.

The travel demands within that, however, will be significantly different from those pre-Covid, in light of hybrid working, so we will have to see how that will play out in the long term.  The numbers are increasing but the travel patterns are likely to shift, so that will be a learning exercise over the next year.  I hope we can achieve the target within the next two years, although that will be subject to continued funding in public transport.

I hope that in two years, we will be back to 150 million.<\/p> <p>  The 90-minute fare has been welcomed.  We can never give enough information to customers, so we will continue with the NTA to advise customers of the change, but it has been broadly welcomed.  It will assist with changing habits, particularly in the younger generation, and with trying to get them to continue using the bus.  It is easier to get a customer to stay with the bus than it is to attract a customer onto public transport, from a cost point of view, which is true of any business in any industry.  That will help us hold on to customers and the change has been welcomed.<\/p> <p>  On the new fares, the Minister will make an announcement on that and, therefore, I am not at liberty to comment on when it is coming in, although it is imminent.  Dublin Bus will give a significant reduction of 20% on our machines.  We are ready and waiting to implement it and will do so overnight.

In Dublin, for example, we will track how many increased journeys are undertaken in a small, confined space within the city centre.  If there have been more journeys within 1 km of the GPO, they will not generally be car users, assuming there has been no subsequent increase coming in from the suburbs, and we are able to find that out at a micro level and dig down into it.  There is an expectation that the fares reductions will lead to an increase in the number of journeys but globally, fare reduction on its own does not result in modal shift, which is what we really want to achieve, rather than people using the bus more often in a way that will just take away from the Government&rsquo;s strategy to promote walking and healthy travel at the top of the pyramid.  It could counteract that, although there is no question the reductions will be welcome.<\/p> <p>  On the need to achieve consensus, this goes back to what I mentioned earlier in regard to multi-year funding.  If all parties - business, the Government and operators - are in agreement and the funding is there to underpin what we are trying to aspire to and move towards, it will be far easier than if all the disparate parts have different views.<\/p><p>It is public transport, private transport and business.  There will be different views but there needs to be some kind of view that this is what is best for the vast majority and does not really impact negatively on other people.  That is what I mean by consensus.  At least if we have a fair wind behind us, everyone can make a significant beneficial impact.  We do not want to do that to the detriment of a large proportion of society.  That is not useful.<\/p><p> On mobility as a service and demand responsive transport, DRT, mobility as a service, this is essentially a technology platform for all public transport and private modes, which a person would use through one app.  If I want to rent a car or use six bus journeys, two train journeys, four e-scooters and seven bikes this week, I can plug that in and go.  I do not have to buy a monthly or weekly ticket for this or that; I kind of pick and choose.  The technology system is the enabler for that.  Then, the National Transport Authority, NTA, or somebody else would be asked to implement it.  The Government would be the keeper of the brand so it would only let really good operators that are investing in their own service into that system.  There is a big spectrum within that.  Account-based ticketing is part of that but there is a big spectrum.  There is a choice to make for Government on what policy it wants to pursue within that area.  Some areas are pursuing it quite aggressively.<\/p><p> Again, however, this will be around modal shift and giving people alternative options that are better than private mode.  It is also about recognising that not all but many of us will still need a private car for some element.  We are not going to do away with that but we can minimise the journey and make the alternative journey as attractive as the car.  Mobility as a service will help to do that as well.<\/p><p> DRT, again, is around technology and transport merging.  In an urban environment, one could have a localised service so, again, the DRT piece involves a person having the app.  It is not door-to-door; it is a kind of corner-to-corner dynamic bus route.  It is not a fixed route.  It depends on how much resource people want to put into it.  It could be set so that when a person requests a bus, it will be there guaranteed within 20, 30 or 40 minutes.  It depends on how many buses are put into it.  The algorithm will say here is the best route and here is how we can pick the people up.  We can have smaller buses.  We can have driverless buses, which they have in Europe.  They have dynamic routes so money can be saved on that.  That would generally feed into a hub and spoke system. If a person was out in Stamullen, therefore, he or she might have that sort of system into the rail station or into Swords or somewhere like that.  That will connect that person in with a bigger transport network.  It is dynamic, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1665,"content":"<p>I have heard about those pieces and they are technology-dependent.

The point is that we have to put our hands up and say that Ireland is an unmitigated disaster when it comes to delivering infrastructure for public transport in our city centres in particular.  Obviously, Dublin as a primate city certainly suffers heavily from congestion in comparison to many other countries within the European Union.<\/p><p> I am not sure if Mr. Jose from the Dublin Commuter Coalition has seen my previous contribution but I am guilty as charged, as are many others who live in rural Ireland, as I commute to Dublin city, and I commute twice a week for work, but public transport is not an option for me.  What practical steps can the Dublin Commuter Coalition recommend to reduce the volume of traffic on the M1, M2, M3, N4, N7 and M11?  Can it suggest transit facilities?  Unfortunately, much of the traffic in Dublin city centre is the result of people commuting from radial towns around the capital city, while the provision of bus lanes, space for segregated cycleways and an increased footpath infrastructure are badly needed.

BusConnects mostly concerns the area inside the M50 and, therefore, it is important to look at regional bus corridors outside of that as well.  We must build long-term projects now.  We must start the design and planning now in order that we will have a pipeline of projects to keep funding and building when resources are favourable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feljin Jose"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1684,"content":"<p>That is great.

Obviously it is grand if one lives in a town that has good infrastructure such as rail infrastructure.  Recently I talked to a colleague of mine, the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, from County Meath and learned that the Government is looking to significantly invest in rail infrastructure in that part of Ireland and he is working quite hard on that.

The review will be a huge determining factor in the development of all new infrastructure so we can get away from the situations like the metro projects in Dublin.  I mean the DART interconnector and other projects had many false starts that were never developed in the original time lengths that had been set out for construction.  The review is an important process for any body that genuinely wants to make a positive impact on how quickly we can build climate-friendly infrastructure and put it in place.  Given the situation that we are in today, speeding up the process is crucial.  Therefore, we must get rid of some of the roadblocks that have impinged for decades on the development of new public transport infrastructure in this State.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Dublin Bus on the development of arterial infrastructure, which is a point that I am focusing on throughout today's committee.  How does Dublin Bus plan to take cars off the arterial routes and on to its services, once one goes beyond the M50?  That is an important aspect and is so often missed.<\/p> <p>  Ms Anne Graham, CEO of the NTA, mentioned at our previous session that the NTA will develop new park-and-ride facilities.  Quite frankly, it is an easy opportunity to procure ground on a lot of the arterial routes so that those who do not have the luxury of living in places like Dublin and, indeed, in Cork, which is my own area and is not under the remit of Dublin Bus, will be able to leave their cars outside of the city centres and board public transport that will bring them into places of work and retail within Dublin, and particularly to sporting venues.  We have a really good opportunity to utilise that.  Has Dublin Bus anything to say on this matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#S00500","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1687,"content":"<p>Ultimately, the NTA decides where park-and-ride facilities are located, their scale and whether they will be introduced as fully private operations or as State-owned and State-managed operations.  The view of Dublin Bus is that park-and-ride facilities have a role to play.  We would welcome an opportunity to use our experience to deliver them.  Primarily, in terms of what is required to provide park-and-ride facilities, and in all of the suburbs for the areas that come into the city, our customers want frequent, reliable and punctual services that give them a better alternative than a car.  Dublin Bus seeks to increase the frequency of services, and ensure that they are very punctual and reliable.  One also needs to have a journey time that is at a minimum equal to a private mode.  One must set the fare correctly.  Finally, to get people out of their cars, the park-and-ride facility must be sited at a good and secure location and be a welcoming environment.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Bus believes that well positioned and fully funded park-and-ride facilities would form a great part of the integrated transport system that will also have to penalise private mode use because we all battle for the same road space.  Our view is that one could have a park-and-ride facility for 1,000 vehicles somewhere in County Meath but if one needs two hours on a bus and can do the journey in an hour in a car, then one will choose to drive.<\/p> <p>  We believe that these facilities can be very successful if they form part of an integrated transport system.  Dublin Bus operated them many years ago.  I am sure that people will remember Operation Freeflow where one could avail of a park-and-ride facility at the Spa in Lucan, Stillorgan and Whitehall.  These facilities were very successful because they were faster than the private car mode and were extremely cheap.  Dublin Bus would like to play a role in these facilities and look forward to the NTA making provision for them within its transport ecosystem. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1688,"content":"<p>That is fascinating to hear.  I feel these facilities would make a huge difference to the lives of people who live in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>While we have been here, a couple of people have tweeted to ask me why I do not use public transport to get to and from Dublin.  The answer is that doing so adds an hour and a half to my journey.  I have to go to a train station, park my car, get the train to Dublin and then commute from the train station in Dublin to my place of work.  In a job like this, I cannot afford to lose three hours in a working day.  That is the case for many others who have to come to Dublin for work, even if they are only doing it once or twice a week.  There are thousands upon thousands of people like me who have to come to the city as part of their role or job.  <\/p><p> With regard to the integration of the bus routes operated by Dublin Bus, it is an excellent service but there is obviously scope for improvement.  I compliment Dublin Bus.  When it comes to taking cars off the road outside of the city limits and beyond M50, there is great scope to totally change the interaction between transport inside Dublin and outside of it, thereby taking more and more cars off the road that would otherwise come into the city centre, effectively blocking up space needed for the introduction of mobility infrastructure for cycling and walking.  I referenced Paris.  I have been there and using public transport there is a really enjoyable experience.  Fantastic work has been done under the current mayor to improve cycling and mobility infrastructure.  We can do that in Ireland but we have to address the issue of the traffic coming in and out of Dublin city on the arterial routes.  That could be done through investment in park-and-ride infrastructure.  There is some disagreement on that.  Some feel that this solution is only half thought-out because the car is not ruled out completely.  However, if you are living in a rural house or a small town or village, you will just not have the same level of services as someone living in a major town.  I am trying to think of a town outside of Dublin that does not have rail infrastructure in place.  If you live in a town of 5,000 or 6,000 people that does not have rail infrastructure, as many people in the arterial towns around Dublin do, you will want a relatively decent bus service.  That will not be available in rural areas, and particularly smaller towns and villages, however.  I would love to see more work being done on that.  <\/p><p> I will make an observation on a bugbear of mine.  I am talking about always being referred back to the National Transport Authority, NTA, in respect of policy.  That is quite interesting because, when you put those questions to the NTA, it cannot give you a straight answer.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  It is something we have to deal with effectively.  We need a strategy in place to allow us to put questions to civil servants and to be given answers when a point is to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#S00700","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1690,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Coyne, Mr. Jose and Ms Morrissey.

I recommend that anyone who has not travelled on a bus in quite a while to try out the services.  On the routes I use, the services are very frequent and the level of service is very good.  Things change.  The population has grown and we are now running into commuter chaos and congested roads.  The new routes brought in under BusConnects will result in some people having to change buses when they were used to getting on a bus, finding a seat and ending up at their destination.  In a number of cases, it will be a two-stage journey.  People will have to get off and changes buses.  My understanding is that services will be more frequent and more reliable under BusConnects.  It will also lead to greater flexibility as regards places to go.  What do we need to do to convince people that this is how a modern bus service works?  If you got a train to another city and realised that you had to take two buses to a destination, you would not think twice about it if the journey time was good.  How do we make that transition to people taking two journeys, which is much quicker and more direct, when they are used to taking one bus on a route that meandered all around the houses?

I have a third question for Dublin Bus.  We had a really good session in here a while ago based on a TII report, Travelling in a Woman's Shoes.  It is about vulnerable users on public transport.  On the location of bus shelters, does Dublin Bus work with local authorities or others who have input into the landscape when bus stops create security issues as a result of being in dark areas that are not well-lit or where there is overgrowth or other landscape issues?  Does Dublin Bus work with such people to make sure that those destinations are safe for people?  There are examples in that report of women saying that they do not get off at their closest bus stop but at the next one because it is safer and that they then walk a greater distance.  Does Dublin Bus actively look at security for users?  I will come back to the Dublin Commuter Coalition with further questions after Dublin Bus responds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#T00800","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1697,"content":"<p>While I have been here, I was reminded that it was actually 42 years ago, in 1980, that we had our first bus lane.  The years pass me by.  I probably bumped into the Deputy at some point because I was in Donnybrook 33 years ago.  We probably crossed paths back then.<\/p> <p>  On the network design, while we assisted with it, the redesign of the network is led by the NTA.  It is statutorily in charge of that.  We worked with it on the interchange.  There were many queries on that at the start.  Through the public consultation process, some of the initial proposals were adjusted, particularly with regard to peak times, recognising that people are in a hurry during the morning and evening peaks and want to travel more directly.  Where the first couple of spines have been introduced, there are significant peak time-only end-to-end services.  With regard to convincing people that getting two buses instead of one to a destination is a better alternative, it is very hard to convince somebody who had one direct bus route.  I will go back to the three points.  The Deputy mentioned two of them.  They are frequency, reliability and punctuality.  Everything else after those three is just nice for a public transport user to have.  If you have those three, you have a good service.  There will be higher frequency for more customers.  On the spines, which are essentially on the main roads inside the M50, there will be more frequent services on the corridors.  Many of our customers are within that area so they will not have to interchange anyway.  <\/p> <p>  The other part of this is making the whole system better than the one individual journey users may have had.  Part of that is a significant increase in the number of orbital and localised services.  There will be customers who will now have to take two buses instead of one but we are also offering them increased orbital movement so they will not have to go into the city if they do not want to.  If people want to go from Blanchardstown to Tallaght, they can jump on a frequent bus between the two.  There are similar routes to the south and north of the city.  We are trying to broaden it out and provide a greater total package of public transport options for the vast majority of people.  When a bus network is changed, some people are going to be disaffected.  There is no question about that.  We are trying to minimise that.  The NTA has done a public consultation.  The first couple of corridors it has introduced have been broadly welcomed.  In time, some of those issues may have to be looked at again if the interchange penalty is too significant.  This may be remediated by providing for peak-only services or making other adjustments.  The networks in some cities have this kind of system while others have what we traditionally had here, a system that tries to minimise interchanges.  With increased frequency and increased orbital options, we can now say that, while a given journey might be a bit sticky for some, they will have additional services that can take them to more places for education, school or work.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to sell it as a whole package.<\/p> <p>  On the 155, unfortunately I do not have a date for the Deputy.  Investment and the NTA will determine when the 24-hour service on the 155 route comes in.  It is ultimately the NTA's decision.  From our point of view, no additional buses are required because there are buses parked up in the garage after midnight anyway.  Additional drivers are required.  We have a good campaign under way with the tagline \"Get thanked for a living\".  It is going well and attracting employees.  That is part of the investment piece and, as I touched on earlier, it has multiyear funding.  I cannot tell the Deputy which services we will be introducing next year.  I can tell him what aspirations are there but I could not tell him definitively what services will be introduced.  It is planned to introduce 24-hour service on the 155 and 46A routes at an early phase.  We believe that should be done as soon as the required resources are available.  I would caution against holding everything off until the bus routes are changed under BusConnects.<\/p><p>BusConnects will take two to three years, so we could introduce measures in advance and then make adjustments in two or three years.  It is a route that we think would be a success to operate 24 hours.<\/p><p> On the TII report, the NTA has responsibility for bus shelters on the bus network.  Dublin Bus used to have it but that responsibility was transferred to the NTA.  Nevertheless, we feed in our views on safe public transport.  Generally, they are in well-lit areas where there is high footfall.  The Deputy's question was a good one because it contained an insight into the complexity of the bus network in the context of stop locations and how moving one stop will have a significant implication for stops around it.  There are areas where we have removed bus stops because some dynamic has changed, such as the lighting or the infrastructure around it.  A road may be built, for example, and all of a sudden a bus stop may be isolated.  We take that into account.  The NTA is the authority on the matter but it asks us for advice on the relocation of certain stops.  When we are planning routes and implementing bus stops, we are conscious of the surrounding environment.  It is our service for our customers, so we would like it to be a pleasant experience everywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#T00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1699,"content":"<p>Mr. Coyne is correct.

It is only the problems that we hear about and it is only when something goes wrong that I end up calling him or one of his team.  When things are going well, which is 99.9% of the time, we take the service for granted.  It is only when a bus goes missing on the real-time passenger information, RTPI, or when something else goes wrong that issues are highlighted, and while that is rare, it does happen from time to time.<\/p><p> Mr. Coyne referred to the Brexit challenge.  I am not sure what the Brexit challenge is for his company, so he might elaborate on it.  Fuel costs are increasing significantly.  Mr. Coyne might address how Dublin Bus is dealing with that situation.  I am raising with him some issues to which he might reply, as I do not wish to make too much of a speech.  How is Dublin Bus dealing with antisocial behaviour and how much of a problem is it?  I was in London three or four years ago and I could tap my credit card on the Underground.  I did not need the equivalent of a Leap card.  I was amazed that the Underground knew when I tapped on and off and that it took the right fare without having any idea of who I was, given that I had not registered for anything.  Is that what the MaaS system is about or are we anywhere near that?  As users of Dublin Bus services, what technological upgrades will we see?  The Leap card is great, but what percentage of fares are collected in cash?  I am sure it is falling to a low percentage.  There will always have to be cash.  I remember campaigning for every second or third 46A service being cashless and Dublin Bus claiming that it would lose money.  The world has moved on.  What do we need to do to ensure a modal shift and get more people out of their cars and onto bikes, footpaths and scooters as much as onto buses?  When will the Dublin Bus fleet be a more electric and hydrogen one than it is a fossil fuel one?  What is the fleet's age?  I used to be on a bus route that had the oldest buses because it had the least gradient, so they broke down less on our routes than on any other.  That was 20 or 30 years ago when Deputy Matthews was installing electronic machines on them.  We see brand new buses, but we also see buses that are a little older than we might at first think.<\/p><p> I just threw a load of questions at Mr. Coyne instead of making a long speech.

Money that goes into our supply chain is money that is no longer available for additional services.  These were the main issues.<\/p> <p>  Since we are part of the CI&Eacute; group, we have a hedging policy on fuel.  As a State organisation, we are risk averse when it comes to predicting the prices of fuel.  We are not in the business of making profit on fuel margins.  Rather, we are in the business of trying to minimise the cost to the Exchequer and maintaining continuity of supply.  Our contract with the NTA recognises our fuel requirements.

We are proud of the work we have been doing in this regard for more than 35 years.  We undertake a great deal of engagement with young kids in school.  We have dedicated school co-ordinators.  They are drivers, but their full-time roles see them going out to schools with buses, the Dublin Fire Brigade and the Garda and talking to schoolchildren at a young age.  Generally, that type of antisocial behaviour involves kids throwing stones, chucking tennis balls, etc.  There are some incidents that are a little more serious.  Thank God, those are few and far between.  There is great engagement with local communities in those areas where we particularly engage and there has been a significant reduction in antisocial behaviour.

I think there is huge opportunity for a new depot on the outskirts of Dublin that would provide that level of turning power or being able to charge which would take longer in somewhere such as Grange Castle.<\/p> <p>  The main message I have taken from Dublin Commuter Coalition is around timing and that it has been lagging.  I totally understand where they are coming from and share their views.  As a Government Deputy, it is something I will continue to advocate for and am happy to work with the coalition.  Mr. Coyne has two and a half minutes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#W01800","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":1754,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I thank the Deputy for her kind words for our employees.  I will feed that back.  They were exceptional during the pandemic, and continue to be.  That brings me on to our retention strategy.  The main aspects we focus on with our employees is that we have a purpose that is very well respected in the organisation, namely, serving the public.  We advise our employees of that and remind them of it.  We are very proud of that as are our employees.  We respect all our employees.  We do offer them good pay and conditions and reward them with that.  We also offer them a career.  I have been in Dublin Bus since I was 18.  I have been there for 33 years.  It is a great organisation.  We offer significant opportunity for employees.  However, we are like an commercial state body.   We do have market forces that dictate what is and is not acceptable.  We do have challenges particularly at our maintenance grade from other organisations which pay significantly more.  We have apprenticeship schemes in place and we continue to provide the best terms and conditions that we can and we think are market leading that and respecting the excellent work they do.  As the Deputy said, people are coming after our employees because they are the best in the business.  It is our job to retain them and we do a good job on that.  Our campaign, Get Thanked for a Living, built upon that.  We have had some great feedback on that.  It has been really positive.<\/p> <p>  On climate and electrification, we will have some new buses coming in this year.  The NTA will purchase those.  All our depots will go full electrification over a planned time line.  We are out to tender on the first phase of that.  We are also exploring new deports.  There is a depot strategy around existing depots and future depots.  We had a site in Grange Castle 15 or 20 years ago.  We will be looking at south west Dublin because there are some attractive areas there with regard to new depots.  They would be built for full electrification and hydrogen.  We will see where the market goes.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022050400002#W01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":1755,"content":"<p>I also congratulate the staff of Dublin Bus.

Many of the residents associations are within my home constituency of Dublin South Central.

I note that Mr. Coyne is as well, so I would welcome his comments on that.  <\/p> <p>  Lastly, a little bit aligned to what Deputy Higgins said, people articulating their real concerns that their quality of life will be seriously diminished does not mean they are not very supportive of public transport.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  It is very important.  I think the wrong message could have come out of this meeting, to be perfectly honest and I would be disappointed in that.  People are entitled to this.  In my area, there are three corridors that will absolutely cripple what are now strictly residential areas and their voices are not being heard.  If they raise their voices or express themselves, they are actually jumped on by many of the lobbyists out there.  It does not mean they are anti-cycling or anti any of those things.
