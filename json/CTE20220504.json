As the Chairman has mentioned, I am joined by Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer.  While exercises on lessons learned on the pandemic are under way throughout the world, it can be seen from objective data relating to mortality, hospitalisation and vaccination uptake that the response to the pandemic in Ireland was among the best in the world.  <i>The Lancet<\/i>recently published a major global review of excess mortality during the pandemic with data from countries and subnational regions throughout the world.  It found that &quot;some countries ... such as Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and Cyprus had some of the lowest rates [of excess mortality] in the world, at less than 50 deaths per 100,000&quot;.  As members know, the rate in Ireland was 12.5 per 100,000 of population.  The cumulative rate of recorded Covid-19 deaths per million of population in Ireland remained consistently below the EU average throughout the pandemic.<br\/><br\/>Nonetheless we have seen over 7,000 deaths from Covid-19, as well as high levels of illness.<\/p><p>Both the societal and economic consequences of the past two years are well known to members of the committee, with the pandemic costing the Irish Exchequer circa &euro;20 billion to date.  In the context of such costs, it is right that governments and health systems around the world are now investing significantly in public health capacity.  In the Department of Health we are working to find new and innovative ways to refocus and to strengthen public health capacity.  A clear component of this is to develop leadership capacity in public health in order to strengthen and to prepare in the event of future pandemics.  This is set out in the programme for Government.<\/p><p> As I have set out previously, I had initial discussions with the CMO in August 2021 about his future plans, as did the Secretary to the Government.  Given the changing disease profile and concerns about emerging variants, those discussions were necessarily paused until earlier this year, when disease indicators confirmed that Ireland was in a much better epidemiological position.  At that point, and in the context of Ireland's future pandemic preparedness, the CMO raised with some third level institutions how the Department of Health could, in an innovative and responsive manner, strengthen the knowledge and practice of public health leadership.  These engagements had particular regard to public health protection, informing policymaking, understanding the role of public communications and behaviour change and research of relevance to these domains.  Over the course of these engagements, the proposal for a professorship emerged.  The purpose of this was to ensure that Dr. Holohan's expertise and skill set remained within the public service, with a view to strengthening public health capacity and leadership in Ireland.  In this role the Department's intention was for Dr. Holohan to lead the development and activities of collaboration between all universities and the health sector and to develop stronger links with the WHO and agencies of the EU.<\/p><p> On 25 February of this year, the CMO requested my support to progress a secondment to a Dublin university.  He indicated that he had informed the Secretary to the Government of this request.  In early March the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and I confirmed that I was working on the details of this arrangement, including the proposed research funding element.  I was aware that the Government had recently endorsed particular secondment arrangements to the university sector for senior civil servants.  Given his long and distinguished service and the crucial knowledge and ability he brought to bear in the pandemic, I felt it was equally important that Dr. Holohan's expertise be retained and utilised in the public sector.<\/p><p> Further discussions took place, and the Department issued a letter of intent to Trinity College on 16 March which set out the main details of the proposals, with further detail on secondment arrangements to be agreed between the relevant HR departments of Trinity College and the Department of Health.  As part of these proposed arrangements, the Department considered that the funding of Dr. Holohan's post was something that needed to be worked out but that the Department would support the development of this innovative approach to progressing an important initiative through dedicated additional research funding.  It was envisaged that this would involve competitive funding organised appropriately to support the spirit of the initiative outlined above.  The letter of intent therefore provided for Dr. Holohan's salary to be paid, in time, as part of a wider fund which, it was envisaged, could be administered by the Health Research Board, with details to be agreed between all three parties, as per the well-established practice of funding of health research in the third level sector.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, there are a number of well-recognised steps from the generation of an idea to the funding of a specific project or service that all Departments and Ministers must follow in order to allocate funds.  It was clear to me that this proposal was in line with the Government's commitment to investing in public health, as outlined in the programme for Government.  As such, and as required, funding of research in this regard by the Department would form part of the normal Estimates process, subject to ministerial and Cabinet approval.<\/p><p> It is a matter of regret to me that what I viewed as an important and innovative proposal for increasing our public health capacity in Ireland is now not going ahead.  I believe that this important work would have benefited greatly by being led by Dr. Holohan.  I believed when we conceived this proposal that it was essential that we continued to harness Dr. Holohan's knowledge and skills in the public interest, and I regret that that will no longer be possible.<\/p><p> I am happy to answer any questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Watt.

He talked very vaguely about things and said that the letter to Trinity was from the Department.  It was from Mr. Watt himself.  This is all about how Mr. Watt handled this matter.  He talked about that letter setting out the main draft details.  They are not really draft details.  They are very specific in the letter to Trinity.  He said that \"Dr. Holohan's post was something that needed to be worked out\" but that is not the impression that Mr. Watt gave in the letter to the Provost of Trinity.  Mr. Watt very specifically said: \"Under the proposed agreement the Department of Health commits to...\".  So Mr. Watt was committing the Department of Health to funding not only for the first year, a figure of &euro;2 million, but he was committing to multi-annual funding over a period of about ten years and that comes to a figure of about &euro;20 million, which is a very substantial amount of money.  In addition, there is the question of Dr. Holohan's salary over that period and, conservatively, that is probably in the region of &euro;3 million.  So Mr. Watt was making a commitment of &euro;23 million of taxpayers' money without the authority to do so.  This was not a vague thing where one was going to work out the details.  Mr. Watt committed in his letter to Trinity and I believe that he went beyond his authority and power to do that.  It is very hard to understand the mentality of somebody who would do that.  A sum of &euro;23 million is a huge amount of money so I would expect that a Secretary General in a Department would first get informal approval and certainly make the Minister aware of what he proposed to do.  Mr. Watt already committed taxpayers' money in that letter and I do not think that is an acceptable action for a Secretary General to take.<\/p> <p>  Where did Mr. Watt get the figure of &euro;2 million a year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#L01200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy, the letter says very clearly that the details have \"to be worked out\" and we were appointing somebody to work that out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>The letter very clearly says that he commits to \"...ake an annual ring-fenced allocation of &euro;2M for the duration of the secondment\".

I will let others judge the impact of anything I have done over the course of the previous 15 years.  It does not take from any of that, in my view.  I would take the opportunity to say the things we have done in as a country in relation to the pandemic have not been things I have singularly done.  I have been visible in ways that many people have not been, but there has been enormous effort and I could start in the Department and go all the way from there to the front line of the health services.

I did have the opportunity when I spoke to the committee the last day to make clear that from my point of view that was important.  The reason it was important was because if I was to say I was stepping back for a five-year period, as some have suggested, because that is the usual period of time for Department to Department secondments, it would create a doubt and uncertainty over the potential tenure of any successor of mine.  It would probably fetter the competition or likely make the competition for a successor less attractive.  Fewer people would apply and the possibility of me returning would arise for person who was successful.  I wanted to make clear, therefore, and this is the commitment I made to the Department out of respect for the role and the potential appointment of a successor, whoever that would be, that I did not have an intention in seeking to come back as CMO, even if in the secondment terms it meant that, strictly speaking, if I wished, I could come back at some point in some other role.  I wanted to be clear so that the ground could be left clear for another individual to decide to apply for the job and know he or she would have a full and clear mandate in doing that job in the same way as I had.  I thought that was important for the role.

We have to record our appreciation of what has been done so far, which can be done again.  If we go off in different directions, however, as we are doing now, distracting ourselves and taking away the focus of attention from the issues that need to be dealt with, that would be sad and a failure.<\/p><p> I have no reason to be acrimonious towards anybody.  There is no need for it and no gain for anybody in it.  It does not work.  Members of the committee, Ministers or whoever being at loggerheads or cross-purposes with one another or with Departments serves no public purpose.  I hope lessons will be learned and I hope Mr. Watt has learned some lessons as well.  The lesson I see, as a former Minister of State like other members of the committee, is that there can be no proceeding anywhere without the approval and the updating of the Minister concerned.  It cannot be done.  It always ends in tears.  The necessity, therefore, is that wherever issues such as this one arise in the future, lessons that have been learned will be put into practice and, as a result, we can proceed knowing that whatever we do will be done in the national interest and the best interests of anybody.  It is important to recognise that, not least as we proceed to the challenges I referred to earlier.<\/p><p> In that context, there are now unprecedented waiting lists in every hospital in the country and in every department therein. It has been shown to the committee in the past that some people, in particular those who have been well placed in the services, can achieve great results.  It is a question of bringing them all together and putting them all in the same place at the same time in order that the sum total of what they can contribute individually will be seen to be greater, as I have no doubt will be the case.<\/p><p> In January of this year, I requested an urgent reappraisal of what was required, as our guests might recall.  At the time, Mr. Watt indicated he would tell us in November or December what might be possible, but it is too late for that.  That is way off and I think that, on reflection, he will have to admit that himself.  The necessity was to look at the issues that were now pertinent to the realm of the Department, and if we do not do that, we will be seen to have been negligent.  That is what future generations will say.  They will know full well that we have the capacity to take the steps that are expected of us, by whom I mean everybody involved at every level, from the public service, the political service and all that goes with that.  <\/p><p> As has been mentioned, lessons have been learned, but we have heard that phrase many times previously.  Why would it not have been possible to take account of the advice of committee members, for example?  We all had the feeling that we needed to divert our attention to the delivery of health services and put in place the necessary foundations for doing that straight away, not next November, December or the year after next but now?  It would be a simple step to take at this level and that needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p> I am sorry the reputations of many great contributors in the course of the pandemic have suffered, given it has been presented as though the system was doing something wrong.<\/p><p>The system was not doing something wrong.  It was attempting to keep on board all of the people who had a major contribution to make and continue to do so.<\/p><p> Reference was made to Dr. Holohan perhaps being able to look at this again.  I know that is difficult and he has made his own decisions, as he is entitled to do.  Dr. Holohan has also shown that he is committed to the public health system.  More than ever before, the public health service badly needs the expertise, leadership, concern, devotion and dedication of people who have been on the front line, or any line, of the pandemic.  I ask Dr. Holohan to consider this in the context of what might follow, so as not to lose all the information gleaned and all the expertise that is ready to be tapped for the public or for research insofar as the public health system is concerned.  That would be a disaster.  I do not want to continue incessantly as most of what I was going to say has already been said.  I wanted to emphasise that particular point.<\/p><p> With regard to senior officials and proceeding, we need senior officials with flair and innovative tendencies in the public service and I compliment those among them who have those qualities.  It is vitally important, however, that anything done is conveyed at an earlier stage to the political heads of Departments.  These are the persons who are supposed to know, and when they go on the public stage to discuss a particular subject they are entitled to have all of the information at their fingertips.  They need to be in control.  If they do not get information from the system in which they serve, they are no longer in control and they are boxing in the dark.  That does not work.  I hope that lesson has been learned and that with any such attempt in future not only will a letter or email be sent to the relevant people to apprise them of the particular situation, but that a copy will also be sent to whomever else might be involved.<\/p><p> I appeal to all concerned to think again about the position we are in now and the urgency of the matters that are ahead for the Department of Health and the health services.  We talk about this all the time.  It is not something we should refer to only for discussion.  We need action and the action can only come when the expertise, dedication and involvement of those dealing with the pandemic is refocused on the general delivery of health services, in particular the public health services.  That is all I want to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#Q01900","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan for that.  Now that we are through the latest wave of Covid, our focus is on the absolute public health needs, and particularly waiting lists.  We have an enormous challenge now because of the backlog of treatments.  We need to do everything we can.<\/p> <p>  I will mention two points.  There is a need to galvanise the system in dealing with challenges we now face, the more systemic challenge in the system.  We must galvanise the system in the way we managed to galvanise the system in responding to Covid.  That is very important.  People are suffering because they are waiting too long for treatment in many cases.  We need to have that same can-do spirit and the flair the Deputy mentioned is needed in that context.<\/p> <p>  My second point, to which the Chief Medical Officer has alluded, is that while the CMO is the public face of our response to the pandemic, along with Dr. Glynn at times, it is a team of people, including people in our Department, the HSE, the Department of the Taoiseach and many other Departments.  By the nature of it, someone has to lead that team and, in the case of a pandemic, someone had to be the public face.  It is very important to re-emphasise what the CMO said about many people being involved who, in my view, did a great service over the past years.  I thank Deputy Durkan for his comments in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The key thing now is for us to focus on what we must do for the health system to address the challenges.

If so, what actions need to be taken either by Mr. Watt, as the Secretary General of the Department, or the Minister?  What actions will be required going forward?  It seems to be that this is rumbling on.  As highlighted, a huge amount of work has been done around Covid and in light of the global situation things happened.  However, over the past while, a couple of things have happened that are eroding people's trust.  At a time when we are still in a global pandemic and we still have arguably a healthcare crisis, the erosion of public trust in the system is not ideal.

I have not seen the latest data.  I think, generally, people do trust the health system.  They do respect the health system.  There are issues around access, but once they have access, they express very strong positivity around the service they receive.  In terms of the Department of Health, I would certainly be very proud of what the Department has delivered over the last number of years in incredibly difficult circumstances.  I think officials of the Department can be very proud of what they have achieved in navigating us through this crisis.  By its nature, there are always issues in health.  I do not listen to radio but I am told that on most mornings, of the first five or six items on \"Morning Ireland\", close to half, or the majority, are health issues.  The nature of health is the nature of the system that we have.  It is a vast Department.  The health system is by far the biggest provider of a service by the State to our citizens.  It affects all of us.  All of our families have been affected.

That is what I do.  We try not to get distracted by other things that can be somewhat extraneous, ultimately.  We try to focus on getting the Department in the best possible shape and focusing on the big policy challenge over recent years, which was the pandemic.  We have a challenge now to prepare for the emergency department situation that we will face next winter, no doubt.  We also have issues around waiting lists, which Deputy Durkan touched on earlier.  That is our focus and what we do.  I do not think it is possible or realistic to expect that health will not be in the headlines or that there will not be issues and things thrown in our direction.

A request was made by the CMO.  The Secretary General decided to act on it.  The model is not unknown.  There is precedent in that it is actually provided for in terms of Secretary Generals.  It is not unprecedented that a person is funded by the State outside of and beyond their role until they reach their 40 years or retirement age or whatever.

I am only a guest of the committee.  I thank the witnesses for being here and the opportunity to make a few points and put a few questions.<\/p> <p>  There is some history here but at the outset I say that I have the height of respect for the Secretary General, Mr. Watt.  We have a history of spats at the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees but if I were in the private sector and part of a company large enough to afford Mr. Watt, I would certainly want him on my board.  However, we are not in the private sector and that is where much of the difference is evident.  I am a democracy purist.  Once, at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, I raised the question of wastage of &euro;10 million because of an error by the Office of Public Works with the rent of the Department of Health.<\/p><p>It would cost &euro;10 million over the course of the lease.  My question was whether there was a disciplinary process afoot.  Mr. Watt was then in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  He said he did not know but that a \"gotcha\" culture did not operate in the Civil Service and these things were used as a learning experience.  I thought that was a very expensive learning experience.  If it was in auctioneering, say, Jones Lang LaSalle, you would probably not get as far as lunchtime.<\/p><p> Before I get into my questioning, I will say that because something is the practice, it does not make it correct.  It does not make it morally correct in the interest of taxpayers' money.  I, for one, in 20 years between the Seanad and the D&aacute;il and six years on the Committee on Public Accounts and the banking inquiry, have watched senior civil servants waste billions in taxpayers' money and circling the wagons to create a facade to put across a prescribed narrative which betrays democracy.<\/p><p> Do you have a seven-year contract as deputy Secretary General or CMO?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#DD03800","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Sorry, is the Deputy asking me that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#EE00300","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651618800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>No, I do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022050400002#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651618800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>That is the first difference with the precedent of the past.

How can Mr. Watt reconcile that with the idea of an open-ended term?  The CMO has very kindly pointed out he is a good distance from his 40 years.  Therefore, on top of proposing funding of &euro;2 million per year, Mr. Watt was in effect proposing that should the CMO opt to retire in the interim &mdash; say, after five or six years &mdash; he would, under the special clause in the superannuation Act, bump up the 27 or 28 years to 40.

Unless and until the three Acts &mdash; the 1954, 1924 and 1997 Acts &mdash; are dealt with so that you people quite frankly accept there is a democracy here and a Parliament, or an Oireachtas, that are not and should never be blindly subservient to a position regarding which, depending on who you are, different rules apply, this will remain an issue.
