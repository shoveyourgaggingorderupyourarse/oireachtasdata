At that point, it was estimated that the aggregate amount required for Supplementary Estimates would be approximately &euro;660 million.<\/p>  <p>  At this week's Government meeting, 11 Supplementary Estimates were agreed.

We already have an Alzheimer's unit in temporary accommodation.  The infrastructure for the service in this area is very poor and has been there for decades.  We have been promised a primary healthcare centre since 2014.  In the response to a recent parliamentary question to the Minister, I was told that: \"It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages\" and that an application to extend planning permission for the primary care centre in Drimnagh had been made.

What other land is envisaged for transfer from the OPW for the provision of affordable and social housing?  Is any progress being made in actually transferring land?

I understand why those calls are made but we should also acknowledge that from 2016 and as we move to 2020, the level of capital spending in Ireland will move from &euro;4.2 billion per year to just over &euro;8 billion per year.  For this year alone, the amount of capital investment in our country will have increased by 22%, which is playing a role in allowing our economy to continue to do well while we are seeing change and the so-called headwinds - a dreadful phrase - of things changing elsewhere or getting more difficult.  It is like the idea that risks are always tilted to the down side.  Things are shifting elsewhere and we are beginning to see some economies slow down in Europe.

A business case can be put together with figures that are right at a point in time.

One of the issues I have been grappling with is the situation where we have a major project coming up, for example, and Deputy Durkan and the communities he represents want to see it delivered.  An understandable question the Deputy would then ask the Government of the day or the agency charged with the project is how much the project will cost.  The Deputy would want to know what the cost of that project would be.  An agency or a Government Department would supply that figure to the Deputy in good faith and they would supply it to him because as a Member of the Oireachtas he has a right to know what the figure is.  However, the length of time between a project being agreed and then going to tender can be many years.  It happens then that a project ends up being evaluated against a figure that was shared in good faith but the economy has changed, which means the tendering process delivers another price.

The membership of the group consists of officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland, IBEC Ireland, the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and Chambers Ireland.  In May 2017, a proposal was put to the group to raise the current threshold of &euro;25,000, exclusive of VAT, for advertising on the eTenders website.

Through the work of this advisory group and through the work the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, is doing, a suite of different changes have been made to try to support SMEs.  Contracting authorities have been encouraged to divide public contracts into lots, work has been done to encourage SMEs to come together to put in bids for contracts that are of a scale that are bigger than they might be able to access on their own and public bodies are now required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.

FEMPI reductions will be unwound for those on incomes up to &euro;70,000 by October 2020.

The reality is that this appointment will make very little difference against a background of chaos in our emergency departments, and hospitals and of a lack of GPs being available.  Right across the health system, there is a sense of absolute chaos.  Crisis management is the core to the Government's health strategy, not resolving the difficulties or understanding where patients are at, or the experiences of staff across the health service.  Some 100,000 patients have been treated already this year in our emergency departments ahead of the really called cold part of this winter.  Together with the announcement of the spin-fest that will be the winter plan today, one should look at this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, in which Professor Fergal Malone, master of the Rotunda Hospital, who is not a political figure, wrote of lives of newborns being at risk because of overcrowding in the hospital.  He wrote of a critically ill newborn child who was choppered into the Rotunda a number weeks ago from a regional hospital and who then had to wait four hours - in the life of a newborn child - because no critical care bed was available.

They are looking for answers as to why this sort of thing is happening in emergency rooms across the country.  This announcement is not going to change anything.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I this morning have already discussed and differed on whether there is a moratorium on staff recruitment.  One has only to read any of today's reports or submissions from Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, as to how that is impacting.  There are 350 consultant vacancies and 350 consultant posts that currently being are held by non-consultants.<\/p><p>I ask the T&aacute;naiste what today is about.

I assure the House that the Government is more than aware of the pressure that hospitals and their staff are under, as well as the strain and stress that many patients experience, particularly in overcrowded conditions in hospital accident and emergency departments.  That is why we are launching the detail today of a winter plan to ensure that the health services are ready for the extra pressures associated with the winter period, such as a prolonged holiday period, severe weather, seasonal influenza, and the spread of infections.  Under the winter plan, nine winter action teams, each aligned to hospital groups have prepared integrated plans that will focus on demand management, staffing, timely access to the most appropriate care pathways for patients and appropriate, timely discharge from acute hospitals.  The HSE winter plan is supported by an additional &euro;26 million in winter funding, which will support access to the fair deal scheme and the availability of home and transitional care in order that patients can leave hospital sooner, as well as to reduce congestion in the emergency departments.  Additional medical, nursing and therapy supports, pharmacy and laboratory staff to improve patient experience time, improved senior clinical decision-making, reduced length of stay and the facilitating of weekend discharges, are all part of the plan that is being published today.  Additional aids and appliances to facilitate more timely discharges, additional home support hours to facilitate hospital-to-community transfers, communications to facilitate hospital avoidance and public health awareness are all also part of this plan.  There also will be the implementation of frail intervention therapy teams for admission avoidance and reduced admissions of patients over the age of 75.<\/p>  <p>  In other words, as the Deputy would expect, we understand only too well the pressures that winter will bring to our healthcare system, as everybody in this House does.  We are trying to keep people out of hospitals and are trying to discharge people in a more timely manner and into an appropriate setting or at home, whether they be step-down facilities or with home supports.  That is what we are looking to do with this winter plan.  There is nothing dramatically new about that.  It is about better management, more efficiency and resources, and ensuring we keep people out of hospital who do not need to be there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400012#K00500","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1573732800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste reminds me of the conductor on the <i>Titanic<\/i>orchestra who keeps playing music when the ship is going down.

There are beds closed right across the country because support and staff are not available to staff them.

There are real issues here and are not about money that is being spent on public relations.  It is about applying significantly increased resourcing to healthcare to provide better services for patients, to bring about better management of our hospitals, and to fund improved discharge in order that people can move out of hospital when they do not need to be there.<\/p>  <p>   Every week we have this debate around a moratorium on recruitment in the HSE.  People are being employed in the HSE but it has to be employment that has funding.  The Deputy would be the first to criticise this Government if we commit to spending money that we have not budgeted for.  For many years now, we have had huge overspending in health.  The Government has been criticised for that.  We are, however, employing extra people in a way that is consistent with the extra resources that have been made available.  We cannot go beyond that.  People in this House keep calling for more and more money to be spent that has not been budgeted for and at the same time are criticising the Government for potentially overspending.

We are at the point where every day is winter in our hospitals because of overcrowding, patients on trolleys and undervalued staff trying their best on the front line.  That is the state of the health service every day of the year.  Patients face another difficult winter in already difficult circumstances and I have serious doubts whether this winter plan will be able to tackle the issues at the heart of the system that blight the health service.  As the general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, stated yesterday, it will be impossible to staff more in the middle of the recruitment freeze the Government introduced in May of this year.  The Government cannot staff additional beds without additional staff.  It is as simple as that.  The recruitment freeze is crippling emergency departments and patients are suffering as a result.  Nurses regularly report that inadequate staff levels are dangerous for patients in the hospitals.  The front page of a newspaper today stating that the lives of newborns are at risk from overcrowding in the Rotunda Hospital.  That is how bad the situation has got.<\/p>  <p>  The stupidity of the recruitment freeze is laid bare in Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe.  Where public health services once had six nurses, they now have four vacancies which cannot be filled because of the recruitment freeze.  Staff have warned the Government that these services, which provide care to the community and inpatients in their homes, face closure this month unless these vacancies are filled.  This closure would prevent hospital discharges and increase admissions to hospitals.  This is while the Government's new winter plan seeks to reduce overcrowding and increase discharges.  It does not make sense.  That is only a snapshot of the Government's reckless mismanagement of the health services.  According to the latest HSE figures, there are 308 fewer staff nurses and 37 fewer public health nurses now compared to this time last year.  In August, 1,300 nursing and midwifery posts were vacant and unfilled.  The UK's national statistics institute for health found that when staffing levels fall the risk of death on wards increases.<\/p>  <p>  Besides inadequate staffing levels, we now have a situation where this year alone more than 100,000 patients have been admitted to hospitals that did not have a bed available.  What does all this mean for communities?  In Limerick University Hospital, almost 12,000 patients have gone without a bed.  As my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, stated only two weeks ago, the crisis has been going on in Limerick for some years now and the Government has done nothing to address it.  In Cork University Hospital, CUH 9,500 patients have gone without a bed so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  The human impact is clear to see and it was laid bear last week after Mrs. Evelyn Crowley tragically died on the corridors of CUH.  That hospital currently has 16 vacancies and the T&aacute;naiste will stand and tell me that there is no recruitment freeze.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400013#L00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1573733400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

There are two different issues here.  The first is the ongoing pressure on emergency departments that we have seen through the summer and into the autumn, particularly in hospitals such as the university hospitals in Limerick and Cork.  I am more than familiar with that.  The answer there is increased resources and capacity over time, and the capital resources to go in to deliver that increased capacity are being delivered.  What we are trying to do in the winter plan, which is being published today, is to anticipate increased pressure on top of what is a difficult situation for many staff to manage, to alleviate pressure, to keep people out of hospital, and to ensure that we can move people on from hospital care into community care, step-down facilities or back into their homes with home care packages.  That is what the &euro;26 million is about.  They are two separate issues.<\/p>  <p>  We continue to have serious political debate about how broader health reform needs to happen and how we can spend what are limited, but at the same time significant, increases in, resources.  This year, we will spend &euro;17.1 billion on health, which is &euro;1 billion more than we spent last year.  When planning for additional beds, one cannot simply plan for the cost of building and delivering those beds in terms of capital expenditure without factoring in the cost of staffing them as well.  At present, we have increased recruitment across different elements of the HSE and we must have a management system that plans for increased beds but also for the cost of staffing them so that we do not have requests coming back from the HSE to Government for dramatic increases in expenditure at the end of the year that have not been budgeted for, as one cannot run a health system like that.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, we are committed to significantly increasing the number of available beds.  Unlike healthcare policy under previous Governments when there was lots of money to spend, they were reducing bed capacity, we are now back to the bed capacity at the height of the last boom.  We need to do much more.  What we are focused on today is the additional interventions that we can make to alleviate pressure on hospitals with the extra pressure that comes through the winter months, which I detailed in response to Deputy Calleary earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400013#L00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1573733400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste simply does not get it.

It is not rocket science.  The Government needs to open beds that are available in the public health system.  The Government needs to lift the recruitment embargo so that there are the proper staff in nursing, midwifery and consultants to staff those beds, and it needs to adequately resource home care packages.

The Labour Party has been calling for this for some time.  My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, introduced the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017, which passed Second Stage in the House in March 2018.  Some 20 months later it has not been enacted.  In the Dublin region there are now 3,873 children in homelessness.  This is an all-time high.  The situation is significantly worse than 20 months ago when Deputy Jan O'Sullivan introduced her Bill.  The housing committee will ask today that the best interests of children be taken into account by local authorities when they provide homeless accommodation and other supports.  Despite the central importance of the family in the Constitution, when a person becomes homeless his or her situation is individualised and there is no statutory basis for consideration of what is best for a family or for the children in a family.  The Labour Party Bill would oblige housing authorities to recognise families as units in homelessness and to have specific regard to the best interests of children.<\/p>  <p>  There are also 936 young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 years who are currently homeless.  This is due to the cliff edge that arises for young people as soon as they reach 18 years of age.  A young person in care who might be doing very well has all the child supports withdrawn and must navigate the difficult labyrinth of adult services, often going onto a long waiting list.  It is wrong to expect young people to be autonomous from the age of 18 years and to be able to house themselves.  In addition to dealing with child homelessness, we would prevent a large proportion of the homelessness of young adults if we introduced strong supports for this cohort of young people.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly welcome the report of the Oireachtas committee, which also calls for an independent evaluation of family hubs and more supports for schools with pupils who are homeless.  However, on the core issue of recognising the family unit and the individual rights of children, and recall that we had a referendum on that matter, the Labour Party introduced a robust Bill that would make a real difference.  We have been waiting 20 months for it to be enacted.  Given the findings of the Oireachtas committee, a cross-party group that examined this issue in detail, will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment on behalf of the Government to a timetable for the speedy enactment into law of the Labour Party's Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400014#M00100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1573734000,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Two reports are being launched today concerning children and families experiencing homelessness.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs is reporting on the impact of homelessness on children and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report is on family and child homelessness.  The Government welcomes the publication of these reports.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will examine in detail the content and recommendations of the reports, will liaise with the various Departments and State agencies responsible for the delivery of supports and services to families experiencing homelessness and will respond accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  There are more than 1,700 families in emergency accommodation at present.  This is an unacceptable level of family homelessness.  However, it is important not to lose sight of the progress being made in dealing with this difficult problem.  In the first six months of this year, 2,825 adults and their dependants exited homelessness into sustainable homes.  In Dublin, one of every two families that presented to homelessness services in the first nine months of this year was found a home immediately, without a need to enter emergency accommodation.  Family presentations to homelessness services have also fallen over the same period by almost 10% compared to last year.  In the first nine months of this year, 786 families have exited emergency accommodation into a tenancy in Dublin, which is where the largest numbers are.  This is a 48% increase on the 530 exits recorded over the same period last year.  Since the start of the Rebuilding Ireland programme in 2016, the annual increase in the number of children in emergency accommodation has dramatically reduced, falling from an annual increase of 54% in the 12 months to September 2016 to an increase of just over 1% in the past 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  This problem is not solved yet, and I do not pretend that it is.  The way to solve it is through a dramatic increase in the supply of all types of housing and, in particular, social and affordable housing and affordable rental accommodation.  In all those categories there are significant increases in planning permissions, commencements and completions.  Next year, it is anticipated that an extra 26,000 to 27,000 new homes will come onto the market in a combination of all categories.  That is a multiple of the position only a few years ago.<\/p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concern.  I have visited many of the 29 family hubs, which have a capacity for just under 700 families.  Housing families in emergency accommodation such as hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation is not suitable.  I gave a commitment many times to move away from that and we have invested tens of millions of euro in tailor-made, emergency facilities for families in family hubs.  I encourage Members to visit those family hubs, particularly if they are in their constituencies, to see how they work.  They are not perfect or suitable for long-term family accommodation, but they provide emergency accommodation while we address the dramatic housing shortage this country has faced for a number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400014#M00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1573734000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste the response.

This has been a period of profound challenge for media, both local and national.  Everyone in this House, as evidenced in repeated debates, recognises the important role of broadcasting in delivering a vital public service in terms of facilitating political debate, reflecting the concerns of communities and providing a forum where issues of an Irish interest can be discussed, as well as reflected creatively through drama.  There is a strong desire to see media supported in delivering that important public service.<\/p>  <p>  We are currently witnessing a profound change in the way people are consuming media and this is having an enormous impact on broadcasters of all types.  In the case of RT&Eacute;, Members will be aware that in the past five years, the organisation's costs have increased significantly, by approximately &euro;28 million, but it has not been able to grow its non-licence fee or commercial revenue.  What was a break-even point for RT&Eacute; in 2013 or 2014 has now become a deficit.<\/p> <p>Clearly RT&Eacute; has a financial challenge facing it as well as this deeper challenge of how to reposition a public service broadcaster to offer vibrant services to an audience whose methods of consumption of media are changing very quickly.  That is why I welcome the work the management and board of RT&Eacute; have put in to develop the plan they now have.  I know a lot of attention has been placed on the elements of cost containment and cost reductions that have been a part of this but equally important are the efforts by RT&Eacute; through this plan to reposition its offering and to strengthen areas such as its online presence and its capacity to reach new audiences and provide the flagship product that can attract audiences in an increasingly competitive environment.  That presents a challenge for all broadcasters.<\/p> <p> As Members know, it has been working on the development of its plan for a number of months, during which time I have met with RT&Eacute;.  Unfortunately, the plan was leaked prematurely, which unsurprisingly created difficulties for workers who were hearing from the public media, rather than directly from RT&Eacute;.  That will always leave a bad taste.  The plan is important in its capacity to reposition RT&Eacute;.  The plan also looks to Government to provide additional resources.  In the last five years, Government has provided increased resources.  In 2018, &euro;10 million went into RT&Eacute; and the House will be aware the only way Exchequer money goes into RT&Eacute; is through the social welfare Vote where a payment is made by the Exchequer in lieu of the licence fee that would be paid by social welfare pensioners who have the benefit of a free TV licence.  That is the only area in which Government, under current structures, provides direct Exchequer support.<\/p> <p> The House will know from previous debates that the position of Government has been that we had a working group appointed by my predecessor, Deputy Naughten, to examine the licence fee.  There is no doubt the licence fee is no longer the sort of long-term foundation we can have for funding broadcasting.  It has a couple of problems with it, one being the high evasion rate, which went as high as 14% at one point and is now in or around 13% and has seen some improvement.  The other problem is confining the licence fee to the traditional ownership of a television set.  What has been proposed by the working group and accepted by Government is that we should immediately tender out the collection of the licence fee to bring down that evasion rate from 13%.  Where that has been done in other jurisdictions, the evasion rate has come down to around 7%.  That is one immediate source of improvement we can develop.  The working group was also honest in advocating for us to move to a device-independent charge and that such a change would represent a significant shift in the way we approach charging.  It said time would be needed to work out the detail of it and to work out its acceptance at a broader level of the expanded base that would be proposed.  The working group has proposed that the licence fee contract would be for five years and that in the intervening period, work will be done to put in place that long-term, device-independent charge that would be a firmer base for the licence fee.  That would extend the base of the licence fee by about 10%, according to estimates.<\/p> <p> We are faced with a number of issues.  One is the long-term direction of travel for public service broadcasting and to evaluate if RT&Eacute; has got that direction of travel right and if this is a secure base on which to build a new public service broadcasting model that will see its capacity to grow revenue.  We also need to continue to repair the funding part of it.  Government recognises there is a role for it and for this House in reforming that funding base.  In previous debates we have had here, there has been a very strong belief in the House that as well as the funding of RT&Eacute; and TG4, the 7% of licence fee money that currently goes to the sound and vision fund, which is available to fund non-public service or publicly owned broadcasters to support innovation and content and individuals within the private delivery of content, should also be expanded.  A desire has been expressed in the House that we would have a broader base of support, where public service elements of a wider range of broadcasting could be supported.  That is another challenge we need to factor into the work we are doing.  As Members know, the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 is before the House and that will provide for some easing in the fees that are paid by broadcasters.  It will also provide the legal underpinning to contract out the licence fee collection.<\/p> <p> This is the start of a process and Government is committed to working closely with RT&Eacute; in the development of a long-term strategy that will work for the public who want to see high quality broadcasting.  There is also a challenge in understanding the changes that are happening and how public service broadcasting can reposition itself.  This is not a challenge that is unique to Ireland.  We are seeing similar challenges facing other public service broadcasters, particularly public service broadcasters that, like Ireland, have a mixture of licence fee income and commercial income.  The reality with commercial income is that the lion's share of growing advertising spend is increasingly going to the online alternatives, rather than to traditional media advertising.  That is putting a squeeze on the sources of funding for the current model.  This is a time when we need to give considerable thought to how we proceed with these changes.  There is no doubt RT&Eacute;'s plan is an important contribution from those charged with defining a pathway for public service broadcasting and an important first step.  We need to evaluate that in the first instance and we also need to look to the future and look to how we can build a broad base to support the sort of content everyone in this House believes we need to see for the Irish citizen.  That poses a challenge in a world increasingly dominated, as Deputy Lawless will know, by fake news and alternative sources whose validity is often open to question and whose capacity to manipulate people from behind the scenes is undoubtedly a worrying trend and feature of modern social and alternative media.<\/p> <p> I thank the Business Committee for the opportunity to debate this and I look forward to hearing the views of colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400022#X00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1573738800,"counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400023#Y00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1573738800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Before calling on the next speaker, I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Lisa Chambers, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and John Curran - to discuss delays with the roll out of Spinraza since its approval in June; (2) Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss the increase in use of racist or derogatory language towards ethnic and minority groups; (3) Deputy James Lawless - to discuss the lack of secondary school places in Kildare North; (4) Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v - to discuss implementation of the MABS report recommendations addressing energy poverty in the travelling community; (5) Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin - to discuss the report on waste water treatment plants that are releasing raw sewage into Irish waters; (6) Deputies Thomas Pringle and Joan Collins - to discuss the job losses recently announced at SK Biotek in Swords, County Dublin; (7) Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin - to discuss the lack of appropriate ASD units at primary and secondary level in Kildare; (8) Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire - to discuss the Garda resources in Cork city centre; (9) Deputy Jackie Cahill - to address the issues in relation to negotiations with CE supervisors; and (10) Deputy Fergus O'Dowd - to discuss the urgent need for further resources to tackle drug abuse in the Drogheda and east Meath area.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Lisa Chambers, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and John Curran; Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin; Deputies Thomas Pringle and Joan Collins; and Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400023#Y00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Financial Challenges Facing RT\u00c9 and its Revised Strategy 2020-2024: Statements (Resumed)","time":1573738800,"counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400023#Y00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1573738800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I am sharing time.  The most surprising thing about last week's announcement of the scale of the problems in RT&Eacute; was that the Government was surprised at all.  The station has posted seven annual deficits in the last decade.  The broadcaster reportedly requested &euro;55 million earlier this year, while the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, requested an additional &euro;30 million in 2018.  Anyone living in the real world - I accept many in the Government do not appear to be - can see the challenges encountered by media organisations in Ireland and all around the world.  New players in this sphere like Netflix, Amazon and the deluge of free content available have flipped the traditional media landscape as we know it on its head.<\/p> <p>Put simply, people consume media in new ways that were inconceivable a few years ago.  The challenges faced by RT&Eacute; are not unique.  For the Government to spend all of last week blaming everything on RT&Eacute;'s failure to attract more advertising was either delusional or disingenuous.  Last week the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, suggested RT&Eacute; broadcast death notices as part of its remit as a public service station.  If that is the Government's policy for saving the national broadcaster, I fear there is no hope at all for Government policy in the area.  <\/p> <p> The Government can add television licence fee reform to the growing pile of difficult problems it hopes will go away if it just ignores them, with homelessness and the health service.  We have the highest rate of licence fee evasion in Europe, at more than &euro;30 million.  Reform of the licence fee alone would go a long way towards addressing many of the difficulties faced by RT&Eacute;.  It is especially galling, given that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment did all of the work for the Government with its recommendations in 2017.  They included a broadening of the charge to capture households which were benefiting from public service broadcasting, irrespective of the technology used, and the introduction of re-transmission fees, for example.  The report also called for greater use of moneys collected to promote all public service media, including local and community outlets and anyone engaged in public service journalism.  The Government's decision, however, to kick reform five years down the road will ensure public service media will continue their steady decline.  There might not be public service broadcasting, as we know it today, in five years' time.  The Government should get on with reform now and stop wasting time.  I would not support an increase in the licence fee because it would only punish the 85% of the population who already pay their licence fee and deserve a decent service.<\/p> <p> None of this looks beyond the urgent need for serious reform, modernisation and cost cutting at RT&Eacute;.  The State broadcaster needs to do more to help itself and better serve the people who are paying for it.  The plan unveiled by RT&Eacute; must be closely examined.  The potential for 200 job losses and pay cuts causes concern for many, as do the closure of the Limerick unit, the sale of the RT&Eacute; Guide, the offloading of the orchestra and so on.  I am pleased that representatives of RT&Eacute; will appear before the communications committee in early December on foot of my request.  More people watched one of Ireland's matches in the Rugby World Cup on the RT&Eacute; website than on a television set.  That is the new reality.  At the same time, we also need to promote to audiences homegrown productions and talent.  Screen Producers Ireland stated the level of content produced by Irish production companies in the past decade had halved.  It is concerned this has had an impact on the sustainability and growth of the independent production sector.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has found that RT&Eacute; and TG4 \"continue to deliver value for Irish audiences\" and that there is justification to support increased levels of funding through licence fee reform.<\/p> <p> The Government needs to make a decision.  Any more dithering will only disregard public service journalism further, something the Government will do so at its peril.  In the era of Donal Trump, fake news and misinformation, there has never been a greater need for a strong, independent media asking difficult questions, even if it makes everyone in politics and across the board uncomfortable.  The Government should examine the landscape of US television and the spectre of the outrageous, right-wing, shock-jock journalism culture that thrives in America.  If this is the kind of media it wants, it is heading in the right direction, but circumstances need to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400023#Y00500","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573739400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I have to start by stating public service broadcasting is a public good that deserves to be publicly funded and protected in the same manner as schools, hospitals, railways, roads and other public services are.  RT&Eacute;, however, is not a public good in its own right.  The need for public service broadcasting can be and is met in multiple ways, through multiple channels and media.  As my colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers, noted, the communications committee made a number of recommendations in a detailed report that, by and large, have not yet been taken up by the Government.  For a number of years, we, on this side of the House, have argued that a public service broadcasting fund should be created, with revenue raised from public service broadcasting charges - a television licence fee and a device independent broadcasting charge, or whatever we end up calling it - being ring-fenced and made available to content producers that satisfy criteria for indigenous, high quality, homemade productions, whether they are drama, factual or current affairs programmes, or sports or local coverage, as long as they satisfy the metrics of public service broadcasting.  There is no good reason we cannot do it.  It would be a competitive model that would allow content producers to pitch in and draw down funds from a publicly funded resource.<\/p>  <p>  We have recently seen the best and worst of RT&Eacute;.  Dee Forbes had a heated interview with Bryan Dobson who, at his best, gave no quarter to his boss.  We all accept that changes are needed, but Ms Forbes, in her defence of the changes, indicated that RT&Eacute; 2 would become a \"window\" to the RT&Eacute; Player.  We all know that online programming will play a significant role in the future and that online on-demand services are needed, but the RT&Eacute; Player can hardly boot itself up in the morning or play a programme without crashing during the advertisements.  It cannot be so difficult to get it right, given that Netflix runs seamlessly at any hour of the night or day on any device.  If RT&Eacute; is to get its house in order and move online, it should at least get the RTE Player working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400024#Z00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1573739400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>T&aacute; r&oacute;l an-t&aacute;bhachtach faoi leith ag RT&Eacute; &oacute; thaobh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; craolt&oacute;ireachta poibl&iacute;.

RT&Eacute; is to close its studio in Limerick in 2020, with productions for Lyric FM to move to Cork and Dublin.  The announcement was a severe blow to the mid-west and it was welcome that RT&Eacute; reversed the decision.  People in counties Limerick and Clare are proud of Lyric FM, as was shown by the outpouring of support when initial reports emerged that the wider station faced closure.  When RT&Eacute; made the decision to base Lyric FM in Limerick, it was seen as a statement of intent and commitment to the regions.  It is especially concerning that the University of Limerick offered in the months leading up to the announcement to host Lyric FM, but RT&Eacute; did not take up the offer, instead ignoring it until it became public.  It was a visionary offer made to RT&Eacute; by the president of the University of Limerick, Dr. Des Fitzgerald, to offer Lyric FM a home on the campus of the university, but it fell on deaf ears.  Lyric FM is a small strand of the RT&Eacute; story and punches well above its weight in the context of its budget and what it produces.  It is also highly symbolic, not least for the arts and music.  An explanation is required as to why the offer was first ignored and then rejected.  It was a wonderful opportunity for Lyric FM to remain in a permanent and appropriate home in Limerick and ensure Ireland had a national broadcaster that was not only focused on Dublin and Cork, but it was ignored and disregarded against the backdrop of a financial crisis.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard about the job losses and where they will begin.  It is my understanding the process will begin with producers.  That is a fatal mistake as it will mean getting rid of the creative people within the industry and the national broadcaster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400024#Z00400","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1573739400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to have a further debate on public broadcasting.<\/p> <p>We had one a couple of weeks ago and the Minister might remember that during it I offered to meet him to discuss this important issue.  That offer still stands.  It would be useful.  I genuinely believe that we need to get to a point where there is some sort of political consensus on this issue because we need to protect public broadcasting, not just our public broadcaster.  We need to look at public broadcasting more holistically. <\/p> <p> This debate is about RT&Eacute;, which is a significant part of public broadcasting, but the Minister would accept that many local radio stations and other forms of media provide a public service.  When we are examining reforming, restructuring and re-examining public broadcasting, it has to be bigger than RT&Eacute;, albeit that it is a significant factor.  It is also important to point out that there needs to be cultural, financial, organisational and structural changes in RT&Eacute;, irrespective of the funding crisis or the fact it is seeking changes to the licence fee and how the money is collected and its need to increase its revenue and get its house in order in number of different ways.<\/p> <p> The announcement of its restructuring plan was premature.  The Minister acknowledged the plan was made public in a less than desirable way but it happened because of a leak.  I listened to the director general speak on many programmes.  I do not know the Minister's view in this regard but I was not entirely convinced that the plan will succeed and that RT&Eacute; will reach the targets it has set for itself.  The plan did not seem to come with clear and specific targets or be fully costed, considering all of the individual pieces in the overall restructuring plan.  There were many caveats, ifs, but and maybes.  I am concerned about whether some elements of the plan will achieve a lot of what has been claimed.  Was the Minister required to sign off on the restructuring plan, formally or informally?  Deputy Quinlivan will also outline some concerns about what was announced but the bigger point is whether RT&Eacute; can follow through on the plan.<\/p> <p> During the last debate on this issue people referred to salaries in RT&Eacute;.  I accept and welcome the fact that there will be movement in the area, although we will have to wait and see how that will work out because people have contracts and asking people to take pay cuts of 10% or 15% voluntarily, as has been suggested, may present difficulties.  While nobody in the Chamber believes that cutting the pay of prominent presenters and executives will solve the financial crisis in RT&Eacute;, it is symbolic of what is necessary.  The optics of some presenters earning &euro;300,000, &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 when RT&Eacute; is a public broadcaster paid for by the taxpayer rightly angers people and it is right that those issues are addressed.<\/p> <p> There are issues with regard to class in RT&Eacute;, something I have raised with the director general and RT&Eacute;.  I do not believe it reflects modern Ireland or modern Dublin at all times.  It reflects what many see as a couple of postcodes in Dublin but does it reflect working-class communities?  Do we hear their stories?  Very often the stories we hear about working-class communities can be highly negative but those communities have very positive stories to tell.  Many such communities have their struggles, many of which are a consequence of bad policies, but they are vibrant communities which do not always get the space that others do.  For example, some of the weekend programmes on RT&Eacute; radio feature the chattering and middle classes having a conversation about issues important to them, which do not always connect with ordinary working people and their struggles.  That has to be part of a wider review of public broadcasting. <\/p> <p> As I have said to the Minister a number of times, I sincerely believe there has to be political leadership from those in government and in opposition.  We cannot rail against some of the decisions which have been made and staff cuts which will have an impact, such as the partial closure of Lyric FM in Limerick, and at the same time not put our money where our mouths are and support the reforms which are necessary to put RT&Eacute; on a sustainable basis.  As the Minister noted, what is the alternative to having a national broadcaster?  It is more private ownership of the media.  We already have problems with one individual who owns large amounts of the media.  Do we want the equivalent of Fox News in Ireland and not have what is considered to be fair and balanced broadcasting with all of the protections provided by public broadcasting?  I do not believe that is where we need to go and I do not believe that is where the vast majority of people believe we should go.<\/p> <p> Some people will say, \"To hell with RT&Eacute; and the State broadcaster.\"  If we believe in public services, we should believe in public broadcasting.  That brings me to what we need to do.  I have said before that funding for independent production has been cut from &euro;80 million to &euro;40 million, which is a significant cut that we want to be reversed.  In fact, we want the &euro;80 million to be provided directly from the Exchequer over a number of years.  This would provide more funding for independent producers and screenwriters who create jobs in the regions.  If the entire &euro;80 million was funded through the Exchequer in a fair and progressive way, rather than simply increasing the licence fee, it would be better for RT&Eacute;, independent production and jobs and would mean that money could be freed up to do other things.<\/p> <p> We have to have a discussion on enforcement of the licence fee.  Nobody can stand over the high levels of non-payment.  There needs to be some sort of political consensus on this.  The Minister has a responsibility to reach out to the Opposition and others to try to bring that about.  The perception is that the can is being kicked down the road for five years and we have to wait.  I do not know whether that decisions has been made to get any parties over the election or is ideological but it is not right and will not work.  As I said to the Minister a number of weeks ago, I am prepared to meet him or a representative of any political party on this issue to find out whether some political consensus can be achieved in order that there is real change and action in this area, rather than more talk.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400024#Z00500","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573740000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I want to make a short contribution in the limited time available to me.  This discussion has to be about whether we want a public broadcaster and that is a decision we have to make.  A public broadcaster does not have to be RT&Eacute; alone; we are all aware of local radio in our communities and local newspapers, which are struggling to keep the doors open.  If we are serious about having a public broadcaster, we need to decide what we mean by that.  We know the consequences of not having a decent public broadcaster, which can be seen across the water in America where, as my colleague said, there are all sorts of bizarre news stations, the right wing runs free and fake news is everywhere.<\/p><p>When Lyric FM came to Limerick, it was a statement of intent from RT&Eacute; that it was going to reach out to the regions and show itself to be a national broadcaster.  It cannot retreat from Limerick and say the reverse is now the situation.  It is disgraceful that staff members in Lyric FM and other RT&Eacute; staff members read about these plans on the front page of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>before they were briefed.  That is a shocking way to treat the people of Limerick and staff members who have been loyal to RT&Eacute; for a number of years.<\/p><p>The decision regarding Lyric FM was a slap in the face of the people of Limerick.  Was consideration given by RT&Eacute; to moving more of its services to Limerick?  I am not sure if the Minister has visited the fantastic studio there.  It is a large studio and I am sure it costs a lot less to run it there than to run one in Ballsbridge.  The University of Limerick offered a site which would allow RT&Eacute; to remain in Limerick city which was, I believe, rejected.  Can the Minister explain that decision?  Did he speak to Dr. Des Fitzgerald from the University of Limerick about the generous offer which would have kept Lyric FM in the city?<\/p><p>If RT&Eacute; wants to be truly a national broadcaster, we need to examine how it has worked in the past.  It has not featured working-class voices very often and has been very Dublin 4-centric.  The Minister might not like to hear that, but it is true.  Hardly anybody in my constituency listens to the discussions which take place on Saturdays and Sundays because they do not raise the issues which affect them.<\/p> <p>As stated by Deputy Cullinane, when working-class communities are portrayed on RT&Eacute;, it is often not in a positive but in a negative way.  For instance, I am only ever contacted by RT&Eacute; when it is a bad news story, unfortunately, about Limerick.  It does not come to me for the good news stories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400025#AA00200","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573740600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee for facilitating this debate.  I called for it last week at the committee.<\/p><p>It is really important that we put on the record, as legislators, our views on the announcement by the director general of RT&Eacute; last week, leaked to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, as others have said, which was really putting people on the back foot.  It is very important that we address this issue today and that the Minister is here to respond.<\/p><p>I am very disappointed in the Minister's contribution because there does not seem to be any sense of urgency on the issues that were raised in the RT&Eacute; report, which I have here.  The Minister appears to be kicking the can down the road and leaving any major change for possibly five years.  I do not know what RT&Eacute; is going to be like in five years or what condition public service broadcasting is going to be in then.  Public service broadcasting is extraordinarily important.  Others have talked about the kind of news media people are subject to in other countries, where they do not get objective facts or the kind of service that we get from RT&Eacute;, and indeed from other stations as well.  It is vital for public interest, but also for the whole public discourse, that we get proper public service broadcasting.  I am very concerned if the Government presents this as an RT&Eacute; problem that it will not get involved in.  The Minister must get involved in this early on.<\/p><p>Some pages in the report are headed &quot;the TV licence is broken&quot;, &quot;this is fixable&quot; and &quot;urgent action is required&quot;.  These are headings for three different pages in the report.  My former colleague, Pat Rabbitte, when he was Minister did a considerable amount of work in changing the model of the licence fee and of the funding of RT&Eacute;.  This was continued by Senator Alex White.  This seems to have been left on a shelf for the last three years.  I would be really concerned if it was going to be left for another five years.<\/p><p>The report states: &quot;the decision to delay a meaningful reform of the TV licence system for a further five to six years will, if unchanged, have a catastrophic impact on the future of public service media, the future of the Irish independent production, and the broader cultural and creative sectors.&quot;  I want the Government to take this seriously and to take action.<\/p><p>I am also concerned about the response from the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, last week which seemed to imply that RT&Eacute; could get a whole lot more money from advertising, which we know it cannot because it is capped.  The way in which the Government has defended itself and has stepped aside from the decisions that have to be made is disingenuous.<\/p><p>I sympathise with the RT&Eacute; Authority but I do not agree with many of its proposed solutions.  The proposals do not take account of RT&Eacute;'s role as the national public service broadcaster.  The positive developments, which are outlined in the report, include new content, life TV moments and big events, an integrated media centre and a new digital infrastructure and they are all centred in Donnybrook, Dublin 4.  The downside is outside of the capital, particularly in Limerick.  The Government should stop this Dublin-centric plan which goes against the goals of the national planning framework.  All of the Government Ministers should be concerned, because this is re-centring what RT&Eacute; is doing back into Dublin and to some extent into Cork and it is not acceptable.<\/p><p>The removal of Lyric FM from Limerick is positively destructive.  The station has been firmly rooted in the cultural life of the city since it was set up their 20 years ago.  It sustains and is sustained by a wide variety of cultural organisations and venues.  A Big Roar of Support music event is starting in the Irish Chamber Orchestra's home in the University of Limerick at 5.30 p.m.  This will include the Irish Chamber Orchestra, the Irish Chamber Choir, the Limerick Choral Union, Voices of Limerick, An C&oacute;r, the G&uacute;nas Choir, Seoda, East Clare Community Choir and students from the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, which Members will know is based in the University of Limerick.  The people of Limerick are fighting back against RT&Eacute;'s plans and we want the Government to support us.  There is no justification for taking Lyric FM out of Limerick.  Lyric FM costs &euro;4.31 out of each person's licence fee of &euro;130 per year.  It will still cost, I estimate, at least half of that or maybe more to run it from Dublin and Cork.  It will cost some fine people jobs because they cannot uproot their families and move.  It is particularly unfair to those employees who have given their commitment to the policy of Lyric FM for the past 20 years to operate out of Limerick and to expect them to move their families and their lives.<\/p><p>I was very concerned when I heard Dee Forbes on the radio saying that of the voluntary redundancies that RT&Eacute; is seeking, they are expecting a significant number of those to come from Lyric FM.  In other words, people based in Limerick and who work for Lyric FM are going to be forced to opt for voluntary redundancy because they cannot afford to move to Dublin or Cork, or will not move their children out of their schools etc.  That is wrong.<\/p><p>I have already called on RT&Eacute; to respond to the offer from the president of the University of Limerick, Dr. Des Fitzgerald, to provide a home for Lyric FM on the university campus when the lease on its present location expires, which I understand will happen at the end of 2020.  I am calling on the Minister now to insist that this option is explored positively.  The University of Limerick, UL, is already home to the Irish Chamber Orchestra, the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance and it has an excellent media facility, with graduates and a postgraduate course in media journalism etc.  It is a perfect home.  Practitioners and academics in the university already have close ties with Lyric FM and it would be a very good fit for the station to move there.  It would be a profound blow to the artistic and cultural identity of Limerick if Lyric FM is removed.  This is not and cannot be a <i>fait accompli.  <\/i>I am asking the Minister and the Government to stand with us and tell RT&Eacute; that it cannot take Lyric FM out of Limerick.  It is as simple as that.  We need firm commitments from the Minister.<\/p><p>I know this is a wider issue and that there are general issues of significant public importance as to the future of RT&Eacute; and public service broadcasting.  For the people who work in Lyric FM, for the people of Limerick who depend on that integration with Lyric FM, and for the health of our cultural life in the city, we really need a commitment that Lyric FM will stay in Limerick.  It is a tiny amount of the savings that RT&Eacute; is looking for and it is not acceptable that Lyric FM would be taken out of Limerick.  I hope that the Minister will not just ignore this, that the Government will respond, that RT&Eacute; will be required to respond to Dr. Des Fitzgerald's offer, and that there will be meaningful engagement so that Lyric FM can stay in the city of Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400026#BB00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1573740600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>People Before Profit strongly supports public service broadcasting and believes we need to ensure the maintenance of public service broadcasting.  The suggestion that we may not have RT&Eacute; in a few of years because of inadequate funding is very alarming.  This is something that we have to prevent from taking place.  We need our national public service broadcaster and we need to have a clear statement of intent from this House that we are going to do what is necessary in order to maintain the national broadcaster and public service broadcasting.<\/p>  <p>  We have to address the funding and financial issues.  There are certain things which in my opinion should be ruled out right from the outset.  Having said that we need to maintain our national broadcaster and public service broadcasting, we should also state clearly that ordinary workers in RT&Eacute;, or ordinary householders, should not be made to pay the price for the financial crisis or the lack of funding for public service broadcasting.  It is important - I will address the issue of high salaries for the top presenters - that we need to clarify in the minds of the public that the vast majority of people working in RT&Eacute; are not massively or highly paid and should not become the fall guys and victims for the financial plight that RT&Eacute; now finds itself in.<\/p> <p>We will certainly support the workers in Limerick who are fighting to save their jobs and retain Lyric FM in Limerick.  There should be no question of it being moved.<br\/><br\/>Equally, we state our clear support for those who work with the <i>RT&Eacute; Guide<\/i>and challenge the logic behind selling it.  It makes little or no sense, given that it is profitable, selling 35,000 to 40,000 copies a week - a lot more are sold at Christmas time - and there is plenty of scope for it to move in the direction of becoming more digital.  It is unfair that the workers are being told that it will be sold under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, whereby they cannot seek redeployment within RT&Eacute; or redundancy.  That is not right.  We should not accept the idea that they are victims of the current financial crisis; nor should ordinary journalists, crew members, cameramen and all of the various others who work for it have pay austerity further imposed on them because of the funding crisis.<br\/><br\/>Beyond that, we need to recognise that the lack of funding for public service broadcasting is a symptom of a wider problem resulting from the failure of this and successive Governments and the political system to take culture seriously.  RT&Eacute; and public service broadcasting are not only about news and current affairs programmes; they are also about supporting, projecting, developing and deepening our culture.  In this country we do not take the arts and culture seriously.  We provide a pathetically low level of funding for the arts generally, something we debated here in recent weeks.  Certainly, I have made the point repeatedly that there is an abysmal level of funding for the arts and culture, way below the European average, at 0.1% of GDP as against the European average of 6%.  It is particularly terrible that this should be the case in a country, the international reputation of which for most people is based on our rich cultural heritage and the output of our artists, writers, poets, musicians, actors, theatre-makers, as well as Irish film and drama productions, etc.  We give little or no support to the sector, which is utterly pathetic.  It shows a philistine attitude on the part of the Government that it does not take the arts and culture as seriously as it should.  In that sense, any state that takes the arts and culture seriously sees a public service broadcaster as being central to them.  In fact, we have been moving in the opposite direction, with the volume of new dramatic and film output from RT&Eacute; reducing dramatically in recent years because of the lack of funding and support.  We should be moving in precisely the opposite direction.<br\/><br\/>Not that we can hope to ever compete or particularly even want to compete at the level of Netflix and Amazon, something we can take from them is that people tune in to them because they carry a lot of new original film and dramatic content.  If we want the volume of Irish cultural and dramatic output to increase, we need to invest, unless we are going to rely on the for-profit sector, which I do not believe we should and which I do not believe will deliver the cultural and artistic output we want.  We have to invest in institutions such as RT&Eacute; and public service broadcasting generally in order to increase dramatic and cultural output.<br\/><br\/>The key question is how can it be funded.  I do not believe it should be funded yet again by reaching into the pockets of ordinary householders and by attacking the wages and conditions of workers.  For the record, our policy is that anywhere in the public sector - I am not singling out RT&Eacute; in that regard - those paid from the public purse should not be receiving more than &euro;100,000 a year.  I am sure it is a tiny group in RT&Eacute; who are paid in excess of that amount, but they should not.  There should be a cap on pay, but the vast majority of workers in it who are on ordinary or medium range pay and conditions should not see their them being attacked further.  Cutting or even capping the pay of the very highest earners, however, would not solve the financial crisis at RT&Eacute;.  As for how we would fund it without reaching into the pockets of ordinary people for broadcasting fees or higher television licence fees, there should not be a cap on the contribution of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for those who receive a free television licence.  If its contribution was not capped, there would be more coming in from that Department.  We should immediately impose re-transmission fees on companies such as Sky, Virgin Media and Vodafone which re-transmit public service output but do not pay a fee in doing so so.  If they then state they will not transmit it, we should tell them that they will not be allowed to broadcast at all in this country.  If they were paying re-transmission fees, it would bring &euro;15 million into the coffers.<br\/><br\/>Critically - this is the really important point, given that advertising revenue is migrating from public service broadcasting, RT&Eacute; and more traditional media to social media outlets such as Facebook and Google - on a global level, 80% of all advertising revenue is now going to such companies.  Therefore, we need to impose a tax on them.  That is from where we will get the money, but, of course, the Government will not do it.  It is allowing them to continue to benefit from massive tax loopholes.  If, as I believe, the European Union is correct in the Apple case, etc., the Government helped to engineer tax loopholes to enable the company to avoid its tax responsibilities.  If a digital tax was imposed and other tax loopholes which are benefiting these considerable companies in making astronomical profits from digital advertising and more generally in this country were closed, we could generate billions of euro in extra revenue for the State generally and provide the resources and revenue necessary to deal with the funding crisis at RT&Eacute; and in public service broadcasting., as well as putting extra revenue into public service broadcasting to increase the volume of artistic and cultural output.  That is where we should look for the money, rather than attack workers' pay and conditions or, for that matter, reach into the pockets of ordinary householders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400026#BB00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573741200,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400027#CC00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1573741200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Connolly.<\/p>  <p>  In looking at recent headlines such as, \"RT&Eacute; - a broken broadcaster?\", \"...financial crisis\", and \"\"Transformational change\" needed ...\", my initial reaction was to ask what was new because the signs had been there for quite some time.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday I attended a presentation in Buswells Hotel by the Nevin Economic Research Institute in which it discussed the concept of a just transition.  While it was related to the interventions needed because of issues to do with climate change, sustainability and biodiversity, it is relevant to this debate because it is obvious that there is a need for a just transition in RT&Eacute; to adjust to the changes occurring in digital media, in particular.  A just transition is about preparing and being ready for change and having a plan in place.  RT&Eacute; did not suddenly face financial problems, while the digital transformation involving other media outlets did not happen overnight.  I have to ask where was the drive in RT&Eacute; in those years when it was obvious that there were problems.  We recently witnessed the selling of land and the shedding of jobs which were followed by the call on the Government to invest more money, but there is a need for a more radical, innovative and progressive vision within RT&Eacute;.  My question is if the strategy will be enough?  I certainly hope it will.  The Government has a role to play, but it cannot only be the proverbial cash cow or an ATM dispensing funding to cover losses incurred by RT&Eacute; in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  There is a high licence fee evasion rate in Ireland.  The figures range from 12% to 14%.<\/p> <p>It is much higher here than in other European countries.  In Germany it is 2%.  In addition, the collection costs here are double what they are in some other countries.<\/p> <p> The transformation in media must also be taken into account.  Many people are watching RT&Eacute; on devices such as iPads, tablets and laptops and they are not paying a licence fee.  It is estimated that over 10% of Irish homes are accessing content on these devices.  When one adds that to the 12% to 14% who are evading the licence fee, it means approximately 25% of households are watching RT&Eacute; and not paying a licence fee.  That is a significant loss of revenue.  Again, it is back to restructuring and not slapping an increase on the traditional television licence fee of &euro;160.  That would punish those who pay because of those who do not pay.  There must be a level playing field before any increases are considered.<\/p> <p> The plan is to have a device-independent broadcasting charge.  The Minister said the new system must be robust and not vulnerable to the evasion the traditional licence has suffered.  The BBC has similar issues but it appears to be more ambitious.  Its director general has a plan, which is difficult, for its BBC iPlayer catch-up service to be capable of rivalling Netflix.  That brings me to the competition from Netflix.  It costs approximately &euro;144 per year.  I have spoken to younger people and they prefer to watch programmes in their own time, which Netflix allows.  They get their news and current affairs from social media at their choice of time, not from the news at 5.30 p.m., 6 p.m. or 9 p.m.  It is not just Netflix.  Apple has launched its streaming service and Disney intends to do the same.  We are at a crisis point.  Action is urgently required now, not in five to seven years' time.<\/p> <p> The top salaries of certain broadcasters are an issue that was allowed to develop and continue during the financial difficulties.  I have done the sums.  If one takes 15% off &euro;495,000, &euro;450,000 or even &euro;300,000, one is still left with quite a good salary.  Even with the 15% cut, the salary is higher than the salaries of President Higgins and the Governor of the Central Bank, considerably more than the US Chairman of the Federal Reserve gets and more than the salaries of the President of the ECB and the President of Deutsche Bundesbank in Germany.  It will not solve all the problems, but it will be a signal that this is being taken seriously, especially when one considers that the lower-paid people in RT&Eacute; will have to suffer an indefinite pay freeze.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; ruda&iacute; dearfacha i gceist anseo, mar shampla, aitheantas do TG4.

The other positives are sports, when RT&Eacute; gets the coverage, and the commentators, drama, news, current affairs and entertainment.  The coverage of Brexit was excellent also.  There is also \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\".  The investigation closest to my heart was \"Greyhounds Running for Their Lives\".  Without RT&Eacute;, the scandal of what was happening to greyhounds would have remained unexposed.  There are excellent viewing times for the main programmes.  An interesting online survey found that the majority of respondents do not want live coverage of political party conferences.  Perhaps there is a saving there.  There is also the role of Irish independent production companies.  They produce popular programmes with original Irish content.  They provide employment and skills development.<\/p> <p> The main point is that there must be radical, innovative restructuring and financial reform, and urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400027#CC00300","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573741800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.  Once again, I am disappointed that the Minister does not have a written speech.  In addition to health, climate change and housing, the future of public service broadcasting is one of the most important topics.  It is not a luxury, but an essential part of a functioning, healthy democracy.  I expected, at the very least, that the Minister would have set out his and the Government's views and what decisions they will make with regard to saving public service broadcasting.  I will return to what RT&Eacute; should do momentarily.<\/p>  <p>  This is particularly relevant, given the amount of misinformation with which we are so familiar.  Last week, the Oireachtas hosted a meeting of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and 'Fake News', which was chaired by the Minister's colleague.  Members from seven countries, including Ireland, signed a declaration to advance international collaboration in the regulation of social media to combat harmful content, hate speech and electoral interference online.  Last month, Mark Zuckerberg told a US congressional meeting that Facebook does not fact-check political advertising and will not remove advertisements containing false information.  As a new member of the justice committee, I am fully up to speed with the challenges posed by false information going up on various platforms.  The word \"platforms\" is used because, according to Amazon, Facebook and Twitter, they are not publishers.  However, information is going on them that has detrimental effects on people's lives.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that we discuss public service broadcasting and have a definition of what it is.  The first focus is on the evasion of the licence fee.  I wish to focus on the 87% of people who have televisions who pay it.  They are endorsing public service broadcasting.  I acknowledge there is a problem with the 13% who do not pay and a problem with the 11% or 12%, of whom I am one, who do not own a television.  I am open to paying whatever fee is necessary to ensure there is public service broadcasting.  However, 87% of people with televisions are endorsing public service broadcasting and its importance.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the plan that has been produced by RT&Eacute;, it is very good that the executive board has agreed to take a 10% reduction in pay.  The high earners are going to take a 15% reduction.  I see no reason for presenters being on such a high salary.  Public service broadcasting is as important as being a politician, in that one pays a reasonable salary and expects a public duty and public service in return.  We should find a different way, aside from money, to value public service broadcasters.  That is a challenge for Members of the D&aacute;il.  Certainly, I cannot support the salaries being paid to them.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the Irish language, the lack of urgency in the Minister's speech is regrettable.  Members of the Irish committee published a report in May 2019, but the all-party committee published its report almost two years ago.  It highlighted the problems facing RT&Eacute;.  Stillwater Communications was commissioned in 2012 to address an bealach ar aghaidh &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Chuir siad an spotsolas ar na ruda&iacute; a bh&iacute; le d&eacute;anamh.  Stillwater Communications looked at RT&Eacute; from the point of view of the Irish language and highlighted the wonderful advantages that exist if they were used in terms of using many more of the programmes produced by TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta to mainstream Irish.  What is worrying is that those recommendations fit in with Government policy but, once again, there is cognitive dissonance.  The Government policy is to normalise na Gaeilge through every sphere in Irish public life.  Stillwater Communications looked at that and came up with good recommendations, yet that has not happened.  Both our report and Stillwater Communications recommended that Aonad na Gaeilge be re-established, but that has not happened.  The main message I wish to convey here, tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, n&aacute; na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhaineann le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge ar na me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide mar RT&Eacute;.  It has utterly failed to do that.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister replies to this debate, I hope he will address the crisis in public service broadcasting, the necessity for it and the steps to be taken by the Government to ensure we have an independent public service broadcaster that reflects the variety of people in Ireland.  It is ironic that RT&Eacute; in the statement on its new strategy talks about being close to the people on the ground, yet it is closing Lyric FM in Limerick.  It is moving away from being on the ground and from its legal obligations to use the Irish language in the most normal and natural way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400028#DD00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1573741800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  First, as everybody is aware, RT&Eacute; gives a good service throughout the country.  I am not fluent but I know a good amount of Irish.<\/p> <p>I watch TG4 a lot because its coverage, especially on Sundays, of the GAA, rugby and the different fabrics of Irish life is extremely good.  Often I would flick over from RT&Eacute; 1 and stay watching TG4 a lot longer.  That is a tribute to the channel which is run on a small budget.<\/p> <p> Other television stations do not receive a subsidy and must cut their cloth to measure.  They cannot be over-inflated or have a situation where too many cooks spoil the broth.  They must make sure they are run efficiently.  I smiled when Members referred to wages and salaries.  There should be a cap on but not long ago, the House debated bringing people on a lower salary up to the top salary of someone else and now we are looking at the reverse.  While there should be a cap, because some of the salaries are astronomical, but in journalism everything is gauged on viewership so it is a question of whether someone has 100,000 viewers or 50,000 or 500,000.  It is similar to Ronaldo and someone playing in the second division.  Who will get the higher wage?  If broadcasters have 500,000 people watching them or 100,000, that is how their salary is gauged in the world of journalism.  It might be cruel but that is the reality.  <\/p> <p> We must also look inward.  How many days have one of us received a call asking if we will come out to RT&Eacute; and the last question we are asked before they hang up is: \"Do you need a taxi?\"  I smiled on Monday after they spent six hours telling people in rural Ireland how they were destroying the planet.  One would swear we were going to save the world from all the research RT&Eacute; had done, especially farmers and people living in rural Ireland, yet any time one visits Montrose it is like a taxi rank with the number of taxis that carry politicians and ordinary people there.  If one visits from further they will ask if one is okay for a hotel.  These are expenses where RT&Eacute; can start cutting its cloth to measure.  We are in a city, which has the best public transport in the country, certainly compared to where I am from or Cork, Limerick or Galway where Deputy Connolly is from.   I do not know much about Lyric FM because I am certainly not into that but then RT&Eacute; decides to close its studio in Limerick to try to whip things back to Dublin again and leave people who have set their lives up in a different part of the country in the lurch.  <\/p> <p> There is no doubt that RT&Eacute; incurs more expenditure.  RT&Eacute; has reporters in every part of the country and that costs more.  There is a good service where one can go to local studios for instance, in Athlone.  Should the orchestra be moved under the remit of the Department Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht?  Can RT&Eacute; afford that?  Where has the money gone from the site that it sold?  Has it more land that could be sold?  Did managers consider moving to a different location because land close to the city is expensive?<\/p> <p> We must ensure that RT&Eacute; remains a functioning station but we cannot keep throwing money at it and have them keep shouting back for more.  It must be ensured there is accountability.  I believe what RT&Eacute; is doing is good.  When I heard the announcement I was surprised that it was selling something that was making money, for whatever reason.  The one thing I do not want to see them do is what they did with Lyric FM and cut the regional services to maintain the service in Donnybrook.<\/p> <p> Recently I have noticed something about RT&Eacute; that relates to someone giving an opinion that goes against what most or the majority think.  I was watching a show about climate change recently.  One either had to agree with everything the participants were saying or one was not allowed to take part.  Correspondents were coming out with lists such as \"Nine things that everyone should do\".  They need to be unbiased.  I spoke to many people who turned off the television because of some of the stuff they saw.  <\/p> <p> Whether it is salaries or spending on taxis or hotels, it must all be looked at holistically.  There are issues that can be sorted.  We must ensure that RT&Eacute; is preserved but there are stations that live on crumbs, such as TG4, which provide an invaluable service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400028#DD00300","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573742400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Approximately ten years ago I was involved in the drafting of the Broadcasting Act.  There was a great awareness then that there was an issue with the television licence fee collection system and the public service broadcasting funding model.  Even then, people watching on devices rather than television was an issue, there a significant evasion rate and high collection costs in an incredibly cumbersome system where people were going to the court and to prison because they had not paid their licence.  We tried to address that but we said that instead we would wait five years to work out the more fundamental changes in the TV licence and funding mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  The subsequent Government started tentatively to examine that but ultimately bottled it.  The commentary, which there is no reason to doubt, suggested that a Government that ran into such difficulty implementing a household charge such as the water charges decided it could not afford to open a second front in that fight and, therefore, decided to do nothing.  By the time this D&aacute;il formed, it was clear that the ongoing decrease in the commercial advertising revenue, continued evasion and the high costs of collection meant that RT&Eacute; and, indeed, all our domestic media were in trouble.  The all-party committee did good work in examining the details of this, working with stakeholders across the board, and had an innovative consultation process in Dublin Castle.  Our recommendations stand up today.  It beggars belief that the Department and the Minister now think that consultation is needed for another five years.  This is not rocket science; this is not complex policy or politically contentious if the Government only had the bravery to act.  This year, next year or tomorrow with the stroke of a pen, we could raise an additional &euro;50 million for public service broadcasting by changing the way we collect the licence fee by moving to a household charge so that, as the Minister said, all the houses that do not have a television but are using devices are included.  A mechanism whereby, for instance, Revenue collect it so that it saves all the costs of collection and evasion could be adopted.  If the Government did that while also changing some of the rules relating to social welfare, thus increasing the payments to the public service broadcasters, and, as the committee examined in intense detail for years, forcing Sky to bid for transmission fees, an additional &euro;50 million could be raised next year.  That would immediately resolve a problem.  We could spend the next five years examining the broader context of how to address the fundamental fact that social media companies are taking all the advertising revenue.  Are there ways that we can get money from them to pay for content creation?  That is complex.  It might take five years, but the initial measures could, and should have, been done in recent budgets but there is no logic to delaying it for another five years, and there are real risks attached.  <\/p>  <p>  RT&Eacute; management has sold the land, which we argued for five years ago, as it was lying idle.<\/p> <p>It is not as if it has done nothing.  It has also come up with a new restructuring plan, having tried a redundancy plan.  Broadly, I have trust in the executive and board of RT&Eacute;.  They are doing their best in particularly difficult circumstances.<\/p> <p> There is one thing I would do differently and both the Government and the RT&Eacute; board and executive should look at it again.  The decision to move Lyric FM from Limerick, leaving behind a part-time studio, is fundamentally wrong.  It is important for the country that Limerick rise.  The benefits it saw in having Lyric FM based there were not confined to the broadcasting sector.  Having it based on Cornmarket Square, close to the Milk Market and a five minute walk from O'Connell Street, was one of the few examples of life being put back in to the centre of Limerick city.  It is what we seek and need.  It may make sense for the station to move to the university, given that the chamber orchestra is based there, but my preference is to keep it on a city centre site.  We must bring life back to the centre of Limerick.  As that is already starting to happen, taking Limerick out of the equation is a fundamental strategic mistake.  The decision should be reversed.  I hope RT&Eacute; executives will consider doing so, although I realise they face a difficult problem.  The clear voice from this House is that the decision should change.<\/p> <p> Broadly, RT&Eacute; has done everything it can.  Having looked at the figures, my sense is that will not be enough.  If the Government waits for five years, it will cripple any restructuring plan or ability to evolve, innovate and develop new services being considered, something I would welcome.  This is not just about cuts to the programme as RT&Eacute; is moving to try to address a younger audience, use events and have a closer connection with people through new and different methods.  It is exactly the right move and there are good elements to the plan.  It will not have a chance, however, if the Government does not provide the basic and underlying funding required to allow a transition.<\/p> <p> Last week the Oireachtas hosted the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and 'Fake News', with which I was proud to be involved.  It did interesting and important work.  The committee helped us see the power of social media companies in the new media world and their ability to microtarget people.  Essentially, they know everything about us.  It is not just in the media, as this week we saw how Google had collected health data and how Facebook was looking to create its own currency.  These companies now like to think they are becoming more powerful than the state.  The big story is that these companies can generate almost &euro;400 million here per year in scooping pretty much the entire pot of digital advertising revenue.  The remaining money in this country goes on subscriptions to Sky, Netflix and cable operators.  This amounts to &euro;1.5 billion every year going out of the country, rather than to Irish content creators or media.  It is why all Irish media are in such a crisis, not just RT&Eacute;.  Virgin Media laid off 65 staff in recent weeks, which demonstrates the same story.  We saw it again when we considered the application to sell a local radio station to the Independent News and Media.  Good managers in the area have realised they are in a real crisis because they cannot attract advertising revenue in the current position where social media dominate.<\/p> <p> It is not just about the commercial reality; we must also consider the political realities.  People are living and speaking within microtargeted bubbles and the new media world is more atomised and individualised.  It is private and personal media.  In many ways, it is brilliant.  I love being able to tweet, post photos on Instagram and share stories on Facebook.  There can be substantial gains from these, but they are \"private squares\".  In many ways, they are like a shopping mall.  We need a public square for debate and a public forum for examination, critique and analysis of common stories.  Some questions were asked here this week, demonising certain sections of the community.  We have seen this happen in other countries where there are no public media but where people subscribe to local groups that spread conspiracy theories.  We need a public square for discussion and debate to counter them.<\/p> <p> It is not just about current affairs and news programmes; it also takes in sport, drama and entertainment.  As we will not gain political support to double the licence fee to &euro;300, we will still have to go with an advertising and licence fee model.  It means that there is a need for a broad spectrum of programming, particularly young people's programming.  The Government must make a political decision.  Commentators may be correct in saying it has a certain sense of wounded pride as it has received a lot of flack from various parts of the media in the eight years it has been in office; therefore, it now has a chance to redress the power balance and take some power away from those producers, editors and presenters.  It is, however, flawed thinking and a mistake if that is the only logic or reason behind the otherwise inexplicable approach Fine Gael is taking on this matter.  In the long run the strength of the country depends on the strength of democracy which, in itself, depends on the strength and quality of public debate.  At times we must cede power by accepting hard questioning or taking the rap for something, or by even being the target of unfair commentary, but I prefer living in a country with that strength.  We have had strong local media for the past 50 years, in particular.  If we look at the countries where they have disappeared, democracy has weakened; therefore, we need the country to have strong media.  If we do not have them, we cannot say to investors and everybody else that they should come to Ireland because it is a stable, balanced, reasonable and intelligent country that is open to the world.  The Government should, therefore, reverse its decision to wait for five years and instead implement immediate changes in order to raise &euro;50 million for all public service broadcasters, not just RT&Eacute;, as a start in supporting media in this country in a time of crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400029#EE00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573743000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank Members for participating in this important debate.  There is absolutely no doubt that public service broadcasting, as we know it, is under pressure and that we must amend the model.  RT&Eacute; is making a significant effort in that respect as it has recognised the difficulties it has with audience reach for some of its existing offerings.  It is devising a new strategy.  It is equally important that we evaluate that strategy and ensure we can be convinced in this House that it is sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that public money is very important in supporting that objective, but in the debate Deputies seem to have forgotten that the BAI recommended the provision of an extra &euro;30 for RT&Eacute;.  We provided &euro;10 million in last year's budget.  This year, when we were not able to grant increases in social welfare payments, we did not ask the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to provide additional money to top up its contribution, which is the only way it is done.  This year we also decided to tender to replace the leaky system of collection, as it has been predicted that a better system of collection would add a further &euro;10 million in terms of capacity.  We have recognised that we need to move to gain consensus on a workable system for a charge that would be device independent.  The cross-departmental working group believes it will take time to build that consensus, for which it has put forward a number of reasons in its report.<\/p>  <p>  Some may say the local property tax would be an alternative method of collection.  We have had difficulty in this House in even considering the reviewing of its valuation which was due last year because imposing additional charges on people is contentious.  Added to this is the ownership concept, while a service charge to contribute to television, radio or public service broadcasting is related to occupancy of a home.  Naturally, it is a contentious matter and there is no consensus in the House on such a move.  We can then consider the move to bring computers, laptops, tablets and phones within a charge.  That would be a significant change and we would need to consider how a base for collection could be developed.<\/p> <p>The Oireachtas committee favoured a system whereby a service charge would be collected by Revenue.  However, Revenue's view is that its job is to collect taxes, not service charges.  The report outlined some of the complexity involved, and I probably am not doing it justice.  The committee noted that it will take time to build a proper pathway and achieve consensus across the House as to how we implement it.  There is a challenge involved in broadening the base.<br\/><br\/>Most of the speakers - Deputy Boyd Barrett, in particular - were of the view that RT&Eacute; needs to make significant changes.  That view is clearly shared by the management and board.  There is a recognition that RT&Eacute; needs to make its public service offering more vibrant if it is to attract new audiences and reach the platforms on which people are consuming media.  That will require significant restructuring within the organisation, considerable investment in new areas and a reduction in the scale of other traditional areas that are not delivering the type of platform needed for the future.  We must ask ourselves what public service broadcasting should look like in ten years, in a world where the pace of change continues to accelerate.  In an environment where people use different media to obtain news, information and entertainment, how can we ensure that Irish drama and other content reaches an audience?<br\/><br\/>We do not want a situation where the public broadcaster is merely a reserve that is not switched onto by most people.  It is right that we take time to evaluate our approach and obtain a wider view of the direction of public service broadcasting rather than simply looking at charge mechanisms.  The latter is an important consideration but it is not the entire job by any means.  There is work to be done here.  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019, which is currently before the House, affords us an opportunity to consider some of the changes that are required.  We intend to bring forward an amendment to that legislation to allow for the contracting out of the charge.<br\/><br\/>With regard to individual content provision, including the decision to close the Lyric FM studios in Limerick, such issues do not present to the Minister for sign-off.  Issues that are brought to me include where specific channels or radio stations are being changed or closed, the cessation of the Aertel service, the sale of the <i>RT&Eacute; Guide<\/i>and so on.  Some of those issues require explicit approval by the Minister and others do not.  Several speakers questioned whether Dublin 4 is the right place for RT&Eacute; headquarters either in respect of the scale of coverage or cost effectiveness.  That question is worthy of consideration and assessment.<br\/><br\/>I do not have sufficient time to respond to all of the comments.  However, a consistent theme from colleagues is that public service broadcasting is not just about the publicly owned broadcaster and that, as we look to the future, we must design something that is robust enough to support and sustain the value of local broadcasting and local content.  Under state aid rules, such a model would have to be designed carefully.  One cannot simply give out subsidies to private bodies; it is necessary to devise a model where we have quality content that is deemed desirable by the Oireachtas and for which others would compete.  Some of the proposals included the suggestion of support for basic costs but, as I understand it, that is not something that could be approved under state aid rules.<br\/><br\/>NewERA has been undertaking an assessment of the robustness of the proposal put forward by RT&Eacute;.  It has also been consulting the BAI on these matters.  It is important to note that he Minister is not the regulator of content or the appraiser of whether the content offered by RT&Eacute; is reaching the appropriate audiences.  That regulatory function is performed by BAI.  Assessments by both NewERA and BAI are important in evaluating the direction of travel that is proposed.  RT&Eacute; has done the right thing in setting out a programme and seeking to reposition itself.  The Government will strive to support that repositioning.  As all Members will agree, it is vital that we sustain the production of vigorous, open and culturally diverse content of Irish interest that is available to people.  I am determined that we will do so.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400030#FF00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Progressing Children's Disability Services: Statements","time":1573743600,"counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400031#GG00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1573743600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to have this important debate.  When I became Minister of State with responsibility for disability services, I made three firm commitments, namely, to reform disability services, invest in those services and, most important, ensure the services are person-centred.  It was essential to learn at first hand about the challenges and practical difficulties faced by people with a disability and their families on a daily basis.  Through meeting with families and reading the letters and emails from concerned parents to my office, I am aware that one of the most crucial issues that needs to be tackled within children's disability services is the excessive waiting times to access therapy services.  We all share a common desire to have the best services for all children, adolescents and adults with disabilities throughout the country.  Both personally and in my capacity as Minister of State, I want everyone with a disability to have access to the necessary supports to enable them to achieve their full potential, maximise their independence and live a rich and fulfilling life.<\/p>  <p>  There are two things that must be done if we are to meet these objectives in respect of children's disability services.  Services must be properly organised and they must be properly resourced.  The HSE is currently implementing the progressing disability services for children and young people programme, which requires a reconfiguration of all current HSE and HSE-funded children's disability services into geographically based children's disability network teams.  The programme aims to achieve a national equitable approach in service provision for all children based on their individual need and regardless of their disability, where they live or where they go to school.  The core objectives of the programme are to provide one clear pathway to services providing equity of access for all children with disabilities, according to their need; put in place effective teams working in partnership with parents and the education sector to support children in achieving their potential; and ensure available resources are used to the optimum benefit for children and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The progressing disability services programme is working to meet these objectives by forming partnerships between all the disability organisations in an area and pooling their staff with expertise in the different types of disabilities to form local children's disability network teams that will provide for all children with significant disability, regardless of their disability.  Children's disability networks will be established in each of the nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, comprising specialist multidisciplinary teams to work with complex disability needs.  Although a number of these teams have been in place for several years, I acknowledge that it has been a long and slow process to put the remaining teams in place.  This is due to the lengthy but necessary consultations between the HSE and the voluntary providers and unions.  I am happy that the HSE has advised that we have a final resolution and the disability network managers required to head the remaining teams have been recruited and will take up their posts imminently.<\/p> <p>As Deputies will be aware, the Disability Act provides for an assessment of need for people with disabilities.  Any child thought to have a disability born on or after 1 June 2002 is eligible to apply for an assessment of need, AON, that will detail his or her health needs arising from that disability.  Since the commencement of Part 2 of the Disability Act in June 2007, the HSE has endeavoured to meet the requirements set out in the Act.  When the Act was implemented in June 2007, it was the State's intention that applicants would be under five years of age at the time of their application.  However, a subsequent High Court judgment had the effect of extending eligibility to all children born since June 2002.<\/p> <p> Since the Act's commencement in 2007, there have been significant year-on-year increases in the number of children applying both for AONs and for disability services generally.  This increase in AON applications has led to the extended waiting periods for intervention services currently being experienced.  I am conscious that timely access to services is imperative to a child's development and I fully understand how delays in accessing the service are a source of great concern for children, their families, and my colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  The HSE is currently introducing a major reform of the AON process to reduce waiting times to access both assessments and services.<\/p> <p> I refer to the new standard operating procedure for assessment of need.  While the Disability Act provides for an AON for people with disabilities, it does not define this assessment and, to date, the process has not been standardised across the HSE.  This lack of standardisation and clarity has also contributed to significant delays in the AON process.  The new standard operating procedure will provide for a consistent approach to assessments throughout the country and the HSE is confident that it will greatly improve access both to assessments and interventions.  All community healthcare organisations, CHOs, are currently preparing for this implementation, which will commence nationally in January 2020.<\/p> <p> Budget 2019 provided funding for an additional 100 new therapy posts for children's disability services to be in place by the end of this year.  This welcome new resource will result in additional new therapy posts, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, dieticians, social workers and psychologists.  Some 63 of these posts are in place with the remaining 37 expected to be in post before the end of the year.  This latest recruitment of staff should be considered in light of previous investment, totalling &euro;14 million since 2014, in therapy services under the progressing disability services for children programme.  This investment has allowed for the provision of 275 additional therapy staff.  In addition, significant funding has been provided to primary care services to improve waiting times for therapy services. This has allowed for the recruitment of both additional speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health recently announced &euro;2 million in funding for the further development of an autism plan, which includes the implementation of a range of measures to improve health services for people with autism and their families.  The funding secured will mean that a range of priorities can now be further developed and implemented.  Children and young people with autism comprise a large proportion of the individuals that the HSE meets in disability services, but also in primary care and other health settings.  It is important that the health services are equipped at every level to deal with these individuals and their individual sets of circumstances.  <\/p> <p> The HSE has established a national autism spectrum disorder, ASD, programme board consisting of senior operational and clinical decision makers as well as independent professional and academic support.  More important, persons with lived experience of autism will participate as equal members of this important collaborative team effort.  The board has been tasked with leading on an agreed set of priorities that will have the greatest impact on improving how services can be delivered to people with ASD and in respect of creating greater awareness of ASD.<\/p> <p> Over the next year, the additional funding secured will be used in two priority areas, chosen after comprehensive consultation with service users, parents, and clinicians working in services for people with autism.  The first area relates to implementing a programme of awareness raising that can provide a better information resource for children and parents about the supports available and help to create a wider public environment that is more aware of the challenges, needs and experiences of people with ASD.  The second priority area relates to building capacity and competence amongst key professionals working with ASD.  This is to include a national training programme for clinicians and the implementation of a tiered model of assessment to improve access to, and responses by, services for those with ASD.<\/p> <p> As Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities and as a parent, one of the most frustrating experiences for me is meeting the parents of children who have additional needs and who are waiting for therapy services for their sons or daughters.  I understand how justifiably angry they are at the length of time they spend waiting for a service.  I am fully aware of how important early intervention is and how it can determine not only short-term outcomes but also shape a child's future.  The initiatives I have outlined will not lead to a quick-fix solution to the problems of long waiting times for therapy services overnight but they are important, robust and tangible measures that will vastly strengthen and improve our services in a way that will ensure we can provide what children need in both the short and long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400031#GG00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573744200,"counter":301,"content":"<p> There is a young woman in Wicklow who has spina bifida and who is in a wheelchair.

It causes her excruciating pain to sit in the wheelchair for any time.  I asked her what her daughter does and I was told that she sits on the floor.  I asked whether there was a new cushion coming and her mum told me that there was not and that they were still waiting on an AON for a new cushion.

I looked at the numbers and there is no money in next year's budget for 1,000 post; there is only money for 160. <\/p>  <p>  Almost 4,000 children with a disability are overdue for an AON.  More than 8,000 are waiting for physiotherapy.  Almost 20,000 children are waiting just to be assessed for occupational therapy, 8,000 of whom have been waiting for more than a year.  They are waiting just for an assessment to be put on another list to get therapy.  Almost 40,000 people are now waiting for speech and language therapy, most of whom are children.  That is the equivalent of every man, woman and child in Arklow, Wicklow town and Greystones combined.  This figure is just for children with disabilities waiting for speech and language therapy.  As they wait, they deteriorate and the future they could have diminishes.  Inclusion Ireland has found that one in four children with a disability is being denied the opportunity to attend school for a full day.  This is not okay.  The programme for Government states that people with disabilities should be supported \"in maximising their potential, by removing barriers which impact on access to services, education, work or healthcare\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400032#HH00200","speaker":"1436"}]
