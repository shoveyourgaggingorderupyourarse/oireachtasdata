The study was conducted earlier this year by a multinational company.  It included more than 600 workers based in Ireland as part of a wider survey that encompassed the views of 31,000 technology and healthcare workers in 31 countries.  Although the study indicated that half of those surveyed placed a high value on flexible work practices, its findings also suggested that approximately one third of the hybrid workers who responded had experienced challenges disconnecting from work.  It is important to state that in an Irish context, this survey relates only to a relatively small cohort of workers within specific sectors and cannot be taken as indicative of all those who have hybrid work arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, an always-on culture can present challenges in workplaces even when hybrid or remote working is not a factor.  For that reason, in November 2020, I requested that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, prepare a draft code of practice on the right to disconnect, in accordance with section 20(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  The code is a best-practice guide covering statutory obligations around record-keeping, maximum average weekly working hours permitted for employees and rest period entitlements.  It is also aimed at ensuring that employees are aware of their legal entitlements and how to raise concerns over non-compliance.<\/p>  <p>  The European Parliament has also proposed a directive on an EU-wide right to disconnect.  My officials are following these developments closely and although it may be some time before we see progress at a European level, Ireland is ahead with our code of practice is already in place.  Flexible work practices should aid work-life balance generally.  That is why I have prioritised the right to request remote work legislation, which is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900003#A00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1652947200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Microsoft Ireland's work trend index provided many nuggets of information on both the positive and negative aspects of the world of work.  One part of the research which jumped out at us was that one third of hybrid workers, 31%, struggle to disconnect.  Naturally, this is problematic for workers because it can lead to burnout, stress and health problems.  Indeed, a study from the WHO found that 745,000 people died in 2016 as a result of stroke and heart disease due to long working hours.  The research from the WHO found that long working hours were estimated to be responsible for approximately one third of all work-related diseases, making them the single largest occupational disease and burden.  This is why we were concerned when we saw the data from Microsoft Ireland.  I know the T&aacute;naiste is not oblivious to this issue.  As he has just said, he brought forward a code of practice on the right to disconnect but it is not a right unless it is legally enshrined.  Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward a Bill to deliver a legal right to disconnect in order that these workers can be protected.  These are workers who are experiencing excessive out-of-hours contact on a daily basis.

It can be a matter for anybody whose work is not of a physical nature.  If one does work that is largely of a physical nature, such as in construction or hospitality, when one goes home, one goes home.  Anyone who has an office-based job, however, now goes home and has devices on which he or she still gets emails, texts and messages pretty much 24-7.  Given our particular line of work, we can understand that very well.  The main protection in that regard is the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which states that employees cannot work more than 48 hours per week on average over a reference period of four months and that they must be provided with at least 11 consecutive hours of daily rest and at least 24 hours of uninterrupted weekly rest every seven days over a reference period of two weeks.  These are statutory standards enshrined in law, but it may be that a particular contract of employment provides for a shorter working week and longer rest periods.

The establishment of a code of practice is a welcome first step, but if an employer ignores or breaches it, that is not an offence.  As a result, there is no compellability factor.  For some time now, excessive out-of-hours contact has been an issue for workers.  The pandemic made this worse.  The line between work time and personal time, as the T&aacute;naiste said, has been totally eroded by technological developments that have led to an always-on culture.  Workers are contactable and readily available to receive work emails, calls, text and WhatsApp messages and push notifications at every hour of the day, every day of the week.  Throughout the pandemic, countless workers have related how they are totally drained and stressed due to employers contacting them late at night or at the weekend to request that tasks be completed immediately.  Such situations have had a devastating impact on workers' physical and mental health.  The current situation whereby workers are excessively contacted is unfair and unhealthy.  This hurts productivity because a worker who is burned out cannot perform to the best of his or her ability.

I emphasise that the protection that exists in law is the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.

We probably would benefit from a few more test cases or a few more people coming forward to say that their rights under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 have been breached.  In reality, that does not happen, because people are very dedicated to the work that they do, want to get it done and are willing to put in extra hours, even beyond the 48-hour limit.

The regional enterprise plans will be of major assistance in helping us focus our minds on this.  I also refer to the regional skills fora and various national skills strategies working across the Department of Education as well.  The solutions to this and the skills shortage are right across the system in developing skills, apprenticeships, further education and training and a blend of higher education across nine Departments, including Social Protection; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and the Department of Education.  All have a role in this, in conjunction with employers and agencies locally as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the permits as a part of a temporary solution.  They should never be seen as a long-term solution.  I am happy to focus on that because it is what the question is about.  Our Department has experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, 27,666 applications were received, representing a 70% increase, showing there is a significant demand for permits as a solution to a labour shortage.  From the point of view of my Department, it should not always be seen as a solution.  It can be of temporary assistance in an area of shortage of critical skills and that is fair enough but it should not be a long-term solution.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation we are bringing forward this year will bring changes to the permit system to make it more flexible and reflect the nature of employment at any given time and will also introduce the option of a seasonal permit which will be of assistance in certain sectors.

He took questions on the matter here last week.  That would be a positive step.  We all recognise that they have not changed since 2011.  The social housing barrier and the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, were changed a number of years ago to make it easier for people to return to work.  The previous system under the rent allowance, as the Deputy will know, would have penalised people going back to work.  That does not happen now with the HAP.  People do not lose their payment as they would have done under the old ways.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the social welfare code and the matter of days versus hours.  Some people could possibly take up work for a number of hours per day over five days as opposed to three days.  The old system, the Xs and Os as we called it, did not allow for that.  A number of reports have been laid before the Houses over the years and we should try to get change on that.

It is my view that we will need to exploit all opportunities and means of carbon abatement available to us as we seek to achieve very ambitious decarbonisation before 2030 and transition to a net zero carbon economy by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have met representatives of Liquid Gas Ireland, a representative association for the leading suppliers of BioLPG to rural homes and businesses, and have been made aware of the abatement potential achievable from the use of biofuels.  While home heating, transport fuels and their decarbonisation do not fall not within the policy remit of my Department, it is clear that a range of interventions will be necessary to achieve the level of abatement required.  Government policy will need to support households and businesses to make cost-efficient choices to meet that ambition.  We must, of course, do this in a way that meets the highest standards of sustainability.  The EU renewable energy directive provides detailed rules for the application and administration of sustainability and criteria for greenhouse gas emissions saving to biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, increasing volumes of biofuels have been introduced to the Irish conventional fuel mix through a biofuel blending obligation on fuel suppliers.  I am aware that the use of biofuels is already one of the main aspects of land transport decarbonisation and that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, published a policy statement on renewable fuels for transport in November 2021.  The statement sets out a roadmap for the supply and use of renewable energy in transport to meet Ireland's national commitments in Climate Action Plan 2021 and European obligations under the renewable energy directive.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with stakeholders to equip businesses to take climate action, preparing themselves for our transition to a low-carbon economy and therefore making our enterprise and employment base more resilient.  My Department received &euro;55 million in EU funding under Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan to help manufacturing companies to reduce their emissions.  To incentivise the early adoption and research of technologies to deliver on carbon dioxide abatement from manufacturing combustion emissions, funding under these programmes will focus on businesses using fossil fuels that can install new technologies leading to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900006#D00100","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1652949000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Biofuels comprise just one of the many ways in which we can combat climate change and offer a genuine option while still allowing so many people in Ireland to earn a living.

Some farmers are asking to be energy farmers by growing grasses that can be used in biodigesters along with manure, food waste and timber residue.  The land would be put aside for biofuel production, minimising the requirement for nitrogen that comes from Russia.  Buying oil from America does not contribute to anything in our circular economy.

Biofuels are often made from animal omissions, which means animals are needed.  With more animals, one has to account for the impact.  The use of agricultural land that could be used for food production for fuel production has an impact on the amount of food produced and, potentially, the cost of food.  These approaches need to be considered in the round but I definitely agree biofuels are part of the solution.  My Department has engaged with Liquid Gas Ireland on this.

I thank Deputy Connolly and her colleagues for tabling them.<\/p>  <p>  As we have outlined previously to both Houses, universal and equitable access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines, diagnostics and treatments is crucial in the global fight against Covid-19.  This is at the heart of the Irish Government's international response to the pandemic, and governments in the developed world must do more to ensure this happens.  As a member of the EU, we have been fully engaged in the overall EU response concerning the TRIPS waiver.  The EU believes that there is no single solution, that a multipronged approach is needed and that discussions should concentrate on how the intellectual property system can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and equitable access to vaccines around the world.<\/p>  <p>  Since last autumn, the EU has participated in the informal discussions on the intellectual property element of the WTO response to the Covid-19 pandemic with representatives of South Africa, India, and the US, known as the Quad group.  These discussions have been detailed and protracted, and a potential compromise proposal has now emerged that offers the most promising path toward achieving a meaningful outcome.<\/p>  <p>  The EU believes that the compromise proposal addresses the concerns of South Africa and developing countries regarding the possibility of authorising the manufacturers to produce Covid-19 vaccines without the consent of patent owners.  It also streamlines procedures to facilitate faster production of vaccines, while at the same time maintaining a functioning intellectual property framework necessary for the development of new vaccines and medicines.<\/p>  <p>  Since we last engaged on this matter, the proposal has been presented to the full WTO membership for consideration, and agreement will require the consensus of all WTO members.  Ireland will continue to engage constructively with the European Commission and other EU member states on the EU position on the compromise proposal in order to reach an agreement as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Global production of Covid-19 vaccines has substantially increased, with production expected to reach 18 billion to 19 billion by mid-2022.  This means that, by the middle of this year, we will have a sufficient number of vaccines for everybody in the world, including for booster campaigns.  Vaccine supply currently exceeds demand.<\/p>  <p>  As vaccine production is no longer the main issue of concern, the international community is now focused on the need to rapidly build capacity in low-income countries for health care workers, cold-chain logistics and information sharing so that demand for vaccines will increase in line with supply and vaccines can be safely administered on the scale needed to meet the WHO's vaccination target of 70%.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is committed to the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, with a focus on supporting Africa, where vaccination rates are lower than in other parts of the world.  The EU has led the way in global solidarity as the world's largest exporter of Covid-19 vaccines, with over 2.1 billion finished doses exported to 166 countries by March 2022 and over &euro;4 billion committed in financial support to COVAX from all the EU members.  The Government has to date committed to the donation of &euro;13.5 million and 5 million vaccines to the COVAX facility.  Vaccines have already been delivered to countries including Uganda, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ghana and Burkina Faso, with further deliveries expected to follow shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900006#D01500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1652949000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

We face a significant global problem.  If we believe the mantra that nobody is safe until everybody is safe, then we must act urgently.

The pharmaceutical companies which attended the meeting focused on the need to invest but representatives from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and Oxfam were clear that, given much of the investment has been through public funding, it is the global public who should be the beneficiaries.

I have not had a chance to get a sense of what is being put forward.  Much of the debate on this, including the debates we had in these Houses, focused on supply.  The EU always took the position that that would not necessarily be the issue and there were many other parts of it, including the capacity of those countries to administer the vaccine and the demand.  It is clear now that supply is not the issue and the EU was right.  The Deputies will all disagree but the facts are there.  The supply of vaccine is up to the level required.<\/p>  <p>  Compromise proposals are being put forward at the WTO.  It is not just Europe.  It is the WTO.  Europe is one player and has led on this in relation to distribution and exportation.  Others might have to question themselves on that outside the EU, but the EU has played its part.  The compromise text will be beneficial and will help with that.  It has been worked on since last autumn.  The Government has supported it and it is now informally in those trade talks.  I think a meeting is scheduled for the end of this month or early June to try to arrive at a formal decision, which I think will be positive. <\/p>  <p>  We have to continue to support access to manufacture and production, as well as investment in the systems in these countries to be able to administer the vaccine.  Healthcare workers, logistics, information-sharing and demand for vaccines are all part of it.  I do not agree that the EU has held this back.  The EU is part of the world trade talks.<\/p>  <p>  The Government did not oppose the Seanad motion.  There was agreement on everyone's intention but there is more than one way to achieve it.  The discussion I heard always focused on supply being the issue, but it is not necessarily the supply.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to the issue of the investment of public money.  Much work at our level and European level is to recognise the importance of giving greater access to vaccines and to protect our IP regime now and for the future.  We talk about public money invested in bringing forward the vaccines quickly, and I have always acknowledged the massive public investment all over the world, but that was combined with massive private investment for many years before that.  The vaccines used have involved a combination of new research with investment and development over many years.  We want to continue that investment.<\/p>  <p>  I have had debates in this House over many years on investment in research and development.  A few Members believe that should all be done by public money.  That does not get the best results or lead to the best development of potential medical interventions, solutions, drugs and so on.  We need the blend and combination of private and public money to achieve greater impact.  That is not acknowledged by some contributors here, and I accept that.  We differ and believe it is important to have a right model that encourages private investment as well as public to get the best products developed for people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900007#E00500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1652949600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Two years after a pandemic was declared, we have an inequitable system in relation to vaccines.

Then we blamed other countries and said they had not the capacity when that was illustrated to be totally false.  Now we are going down the road of a supposed compromise, which the committee, after hearing the evidence recently, has pointed out is not the way to go.  Professor Aisling McMahon has been mentioned and I do not have the time to go through what she highlighted.  The Minister of State should read it.

Earlier, I said they are making $1,000 profit per minute.  I meant $1,000 per second.  That is Pfizer, Moderna and BioNTech.  These companies spend more on advertising than on research.  That is true of Pfizer, for example.<\/p>  <p>  It is not true that there is no problem in terms of supply.  It came out clearly at the committee that, particularly with mRNA vaccines, which are the best quality, there is a huge problem with supply.  That is why only one in six people in Africa is fully vaccinated.  The compromise is not good enough.<\/p> <p>It covers vaccines but not therapeutics.  It covers patents but not other intellectual property barriers such as trade secrets.  It does not cover every country.

If he so wishes, we can send him the submissions we received.  Those submissions are stark.  Millions of people have died as a result of the failure to implement the TRIPS waiver.  It is not just about this pandemic; it is about considering future pandemics.  There has been a massive investment of public moneys in research.  It is not all private money that went in there.

The debate has not changed much.  They are very much focused on IP and the IP regime.  The position of the EU has always been that that is not where the sole focus should be.  The Deputies and I have differed on that for many months.  I am not going to change their minds here.  I am happy to consider the letter that was sent to us by the committee and to respond on it.<\/p>  <p>  I have always said that a combination of public and private money is being invested in solutions in this regard.  There has never been any dispute about that.  The figures are there.<\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of the advertising budgets of the companies mentioned by Deputy Paul Murphy.  I seriously doubt that he is correct that they spend more on advertising than on research and development.  If he is right, I will give way to that.  I have not seen any evidence in that regard.  It is something in which I would be interested.<\/p>  <p>  Public and private collaboration has been contributing significantly to the development of treatments for and vaccines against Covid-19.  The development of new therapeutics is based on years of research and clinical trials and, if successful, developing manufacturing capacity and distribution networks, which are not necessarily publicly funded.  Intellectual property is a crucial incentive for the research and development of novel vaccines, medicines and treatments, as well as investment in production capacity.  Experts agree - the Deputies have a different view, based on what they have heard from the experts to whom they have listened - that the current Covid vaccines were produced in record time as industry was able to piggy-back on years of investment in other vaccine productions which has been incentivised by, in part, a supportive intellectual property regime.  That is something we want to protect not just for now, but for the future because we recognise that the best results in the development of the best products and medical solutions come from a combination of public and private money.  That has to be recognised.<\/p>  <p>  As regards dealing with what is happening now, to be clear in respect of our role in this with the EU, trade is an exclusive competence of the EU and, accordingly, the negotiations on TRIPS, as a trade matter, are led by the EU.  We feed into that.  Ireland engages with the European Commission and other EU member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions on the TRIPS waiver.  The EU has not necessarily agreed with the TRIPS waiver on the grounds that intellectual property rights are not the primary obstacle to access to the supply of vaccines around the world.  I am conscious that the Deputies are convinced that IP rights are the primary obstacle in that regard, based on what they have heard from the people to whom they have listened, and I accept their position, but it is not a position that is necessarily accepted by everybody else.  Since last autumn, the EU has actively engaged in informal discussions with representatives of South Africa, India and the US with regard to the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900008#F00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1652950200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

In 2021, more than 29,000 new jobs were created by IDA Ireland client companies.

Yet, 15 minutes up the road we have 50 acres of development land with water, waste water, fibre optic cable, gas and the motorway on the IDA campus and adjoining lands at St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital in Ballinasloe.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste before and he has agreed to look at the potential for the IDA to purchase some of those lands at St. Brigid&rsquo;s and develop a new industrial park there, just west of Athlone, to exploit that pipeline that is coming into Athlone at the moment.

This coincided with the easing of public health restrictions and Ireland's vaccination programmes, highlighting the importance of the Government's efforts to assist workers and businesses, especially through those wage supports which helped businesses maintain a link to their staff.<\/p>  <p>  I fully understand that many businesses are now struggling with additional costs, particularly the cost of energy and other inputs, linked to the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

This goal will be realised through ongoing support for people in securing and remaining in sustainable and quality employment, in areas of identified skills needs for business.

Has any analysis been carried out as to the parts of the EU where there is labour, people who might be willing to come to Ireland and might be attracted to come here, and on the number we would need to attract from countries outside of the EU to fill whatever gap is in the market because my understanding from many employers is that what making Ireland unattractive is the lack of a labour force?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900010#H00700","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1652951400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>A great deal of analysis has been carried out.

I am very determined about that and am very pleased that the Government has now made a number of important decisions about a sustainable model for future funding of higher education.  In making decisions on what to do, we have also made decisions on what not to do.  We have taken student loans off the table.  They are wrong and do not work.

The &euro;307 million will mean the investment of an additional &euro;2,000 per student per year in his or her education.  I was also clear that we would not bring forward a plan that would just address core funding.  We have to bring forward a plan that recognises the cost of education for working families must be reduced.  I want to see the student contribution in higher education reduced in a meaningful way over the course of future budgets.  I want this done in a way that does not rob Peter to pay Paul.  The &euro;307 million is for core funding but it is not an either-or option.  We need to do both.

That is why I commissioned a review of the student grant scheme when I took up office, which was published on 4 May.  The review involved wide stakeholder engagement, an extensive consultation with students and research into the costs of higher education.  The review identified a number of issues, including the rising costs affecting students over the past decade; the fact that the income thresholds for eligibility in the scheme have not kept pace with the rise of earnings over the same period; particular costs, which the Deputy will know well from her constituency, for those who travel long distances to their place of education; and the costs associated with postgraduate study.<\/p>  <p>  We have taken some steps already to alleviate financial pressures, which helps to tackle issues raised in the student grant review.

We have increased the qualifying thresholds by &euro;1,000 to bring more people into the grant scheme.  Importantly, and this was the most important change introduced, we changed the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant to help students who live further away from college.  We have increased the postgraduate fee grant, from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500, as well as the postgraduate fee grant income threshold.  All of these measures are very much in line with and are a commencement of the implementation of the student grant review.<\/p>  <p>  I have committed to publishing an annual costs of education paper, which will set out the range of options to address costs, including changes to both the student grant scheme and student contributions.  This will seek to inform decision-making at budget time regarding what further measures we can take to continue to support students and their families.  Last year, from memory I believe we received a funding package of approximately &euro;30 million to invest in additional student supports.  We largely put that into the SUSI grant scheme.  I expect we will receive another funding package for student supports and we will grapple with and discuss, in this House and elsewhere, how best to spend that in a way that support students and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900013#L00900","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1652953200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Students and their families almost have announcement fatigue at this stage because measures are announced over and over again.

The entire planned increase of the student maintenance grant of &euro;200, announced last October and to be introduced this September, will be completely eaten up by inflation before students even see it.  That is why I called on the Minister, at the time, to bring the increase into effect immediately to help ease the burden, as inflation was already putting real pressure on families.  The Minister refused to take that practical step.  This was supposed to be a small step towards taking SUSI out of austerity mode.

The SUSI grant review is an extremely important piece of work.  It provides us with absolute clarity on the key issues that students and other stakeholders wish to see us address in better supporting students and their families in this country.  Even in advance of publishing the review, we had begun to make progress on those recommendations.  We introduced a very significant reduction to the distance criteria.  That means that many students will qualify for a lot more than an extra &euro;200 in their grant.  Some students will actually see their grant rise by over 25% as a result of that change, particularly students, I would suggest, living in rural and provincial Ireland who are travelling long distances to get to college.  We have begun to cost the measures of implementing the scheme.  I am happy to share that with the Deputy.  I am sure the information will be useful for her own work.  If we were to go ahead and increase the level of the student grant by 25% from the 2021 maintenance rates, as recommended in the review, the cost would be &euro;43.6 million.  I genuinely believe that the findings and recommendations of the student grant scheme review are deliverable.  Are all of them deliverable in one year and one budget?  They are simply not.

I say that because I often worry that a secondary school student might be listening to the debate and wondering if he or she can go to college.  It is important to note that around 42% of students receive financial assistance in respect of the registration fee.  We have taken other measures that benefit students.  One of the most significant measures was introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, namely, the reduction in public transport fares.  While there is a reduction for the population at large, there is a 50% reduction for people under the age of 24, many of whom will be students.

Indeed, in recent days I met students in UCD to discuss the issue.  Decisions regarding which loan products to offer are, of course, a commercial matter for the banks concerned.   That is a statement of fact.  However, I do understand from students who have written to me, those I have met in UCD and engagement with the relevant higher education institutions that the availability of such loans has been important in supporting people, particularly mature students, to study medicine.  With that in mind I took the decision to write the institution in question.  While noting that it is a commercial decision, I have highlighted the critical public policy considerations relevant to this loan product.  I think it is particularly unfortunate that there was such an immediate cliff edge.  I understand that it is entirely a commercial matter.  However, it would have been extremely useful if, in making that commercial decision, a lead-in time had been provided, perhaps even a lead-in period of 12 months.  A student thinking of pursuing graduate entry medicine in March, April or May would be presuming that the product would be in place.  The fact that the product was pulled so quickly, and with immediate effect for the September 2022 entrants, is problematic.  It has created a cliff edge that is unfortunate.  While recognising that it is a commercial decision, I ask the bank to reconsider.  At the very least, I ask the bank to consider if the cliff edge could be removed and a bit of time provided.  I want a lead-in period provided in order that we can consider and put in place a range of policy and funding tools, from a Government point of view, to try to increase the supply of domestic medical graduates.  I hope to be in a position to make an announcement to Government colleagues shortly on additional medicine places, as I referenced earlier.  Looking forward, the recently published student grant scheme review identifies public policy questions regarding greater student grant support for graduate entry routes.  There are significant policy, legislative and funding considerations, as well as wider implications, if the current treatment of graduate entry medicine is amended.  However, we now have this review and all elements will be subject to consideration and prioritisation, alongside other cost of education measures, through the budget process.  This will include consideration of the potential for additional supports for students of graduate entry medicine.  We are looking at what we can do.  I encourage the bank to provide more time and not create this immediate cliff edge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900014#M00800","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1652953800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  In the Minister's previous engagement with Deputy Conway-Walsh, he mentioned the fact that he did not want to talk about barriers to education, because he wants everyone to believe that they can go to college.  That is very relevant and important and I endorse that.  However, there are certain courses that are simply not accessible to students, regardless of how hard they might try to access them.  For example, 4% of the graduate entry medicine student cohort come from what would have been previously categorised as disadvantaged backgrounds.  The student loan that was previously provided by the Bank of Ireland came to &euro;60,000 over the course of five years.  However, that required a parental guarantee of over &euro;50,000.  That potentially excluded people from one-parent families and those living in poverty, as one in six people do in this country.  The decision made by the bank was a commercial one.  However, the consequence was that certain courses in our State were simply the preserve of those who could afford them.  I think the Minister agrees that this should not continue.

I also think that diverse routes of entry into medicine are good.  There is an idea that everyone must start the course immediately after finishing school.  However, it may be advantageous to actually have doctors who have studied something else, for example, science or occupational therapy, and go on to study medicine.  There is a policy benefit from the health service's point of view as well.  Being honest, I think that as a Department and a Government, we need to do more in supporting those who take the graduate entry medicine route.  It is complex, because the course is a level 8 course.  We need to ensure that there is no contagion or unintended policy consequences.  We already provide some financial assistance towards the costs for students.  There are options to do more.  We are looking at whether we can do more in the context of the budget and the SUSI review.

There are examples from other jurisdictions, such as the Scottish St. Andrew's model, whereby students got access to study medicine through a bursary for accommodation and living costs.  Those students made a commitment to work in NHS Scotland.  Such a model could have huge benefits for us.  If we are educating people from whatever level and age, bringing them into our own health service and getting a commitment that they will stay there if we invest in their education, that could have positive ramifications both for our health service and society in general.

For the record, graduate entry medicine courses are not approved for funding under the student grant schemes because progression is a key tenet.

Completion of a graduate-entry medicine degree also confers a further level 8 qualification.  I accept, however, that there is a difference here because we want to train more people and to create more pathways.  We are looking at how we can do more.  There are options where we can increase the State&rsquo;s contribution towards the fees or we can change the eligibility for SUSI grants, or we could look to doing a bit of both.

The closure of education and training facilities in response to the Covid-19 pandemic precluded access to off-the-job training.  The very welcome growth in registrations has compounded these pressures.  However, the education and training system is responding energetically to reduce waiting times.  My Department has been advised by SOLAS that there are 8,208 apprentices waiting to access off-the-job training, of whom 7,228 are waiting for phase 2 and 980 for phases 4 and 6.  It can be expected that at any one time, some apprentices will be waiting for a planned intake.  The numbers currently waiting are high, however, and reflect the unprecedented circumstances from March 2020.  My Department has also been advised that as of 17 May, the number of apprentices waiting for all phases of off-the-job training included: 3,616 in electrical; 1,162 in plumbing; 844 in carpentry; and 98 in bricklaying and stone-laying.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of a major response plan to address the waiting lists is well advanced.  In order to introduce additional capacity, capital funding of &euro;20 million was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade facilities.  Additional funding of &euro;17 million has been provided to SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to underpin the plan to reduce backlogs.  Some &euro;6 million of this is being invested in employing additional instructors, with over 100 additional posts approved.<\/p>  <p>  In light of progress in dealing with the pandemic by means of public health management, classes returned to their full intake of 14 to 16 apprentices last September.  More than 8,400 apprentices - in excess of 70% of those delayed by Covid-19 - have now progressed.  This includes more than 700 final-year apprentices who have been fast-tracked to complete their qualification.

If one looks at the emphasis on ensuring that there are not backlogs in the higher education sector in the practical side of medicine, dentistry, etc., compared with the waiting lists which have built up in the areas to which I referred in the original question, it does not reflect that Government priority.

Courses that provide healthcare workers, courses related to construction and courses related to the green economy are of particular interest because we see both significant demand for such courses and significant need for workers in those areas.  I am pleased to say that engagements on providing additional places are at a very advanced stage and it is hoped that approximately 1,000 additional places can be created.<\/p> <p> However, increasing the number of places is only one part of the answer.  In tandem with this, it is vital that all learners have access to the right courses for them across the spectrum of provision.  Increasing capacity in apprenticeship programmes, as we discussed earlier, and the provision of further education options must be part of a balanced third level education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900015#N01300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652955000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's answer.

The most intense area of engagement, to be truthful, has been around places in medicine.  As I said in answer to an earlier question, it is the job of my Department to try to respond to the workforce planning needs of other Departments.  It is not my Department's job to say we need X number of doctors or Y number of social workers.  Where other Departments and agencies come forward and say there is a need to train more doctors, nurses and so on, we will work with them on that.  It is only right and proper that we do so because creating a college place will not fix the issue; there must also be a matching clinical placement.<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased with the level of engagement we have had from the Department of Heath, particularly around medicine places.  I expect to be in a position to finalise a significant increase in medicine places for this September.  Better than that, we are also working to form a view on where we will get to over the next five years in terms of increasing medicine places to a sustainable level.  Similarly, the Department of Health has been very helpful around nursing training and the work done by the chief nursing officer in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I am almost out of time.  We are also doing some work on exactly what the Deputy referred to, that is, lifelong learning.  We have people working in our nursing homes and caring for the most loved people in our lives, including our parents and grandparents, but we have often not academically recognised the brilliance of the work they do.  Last week, we launched a new apprenticeship programme for healthcare assistants to enable them to get that recognition and to access a career pathway that may not have been available to them to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900016#O00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1652955000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>This is an issue we certainly will be revisiting into the future.

I have had my own meetings lately at which I have heard some positive information in regard to criteria being met.  However, there still are major worries.  There have been a number of missteps and we know the route map will be through the provisions of section 38 of the Technological Universities Act 2018.  We need to ensure it happens.  The Minister probably has met those involved with the regional development centre and has seen the huge impact DkIT is having in regard to research, the whole M1 Border corridor area and also in regard to business innovation, including its involvement with Enterprise Ireland and all the other agencies.  The one point everybody involved makes is the absolute necessity of ensuring DkIT reaches technological university status.

It has not been done properly for many years and we are bearing the brunt of the consequences of that in terms of front-line staffing.

I have spoken about this to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, for instance, and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability services.  There were times in this country when it was a funding issue that prevented an extra speech and language therapist from being hired.

Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, I have tasked my officials with finding ways to facilitate the continuing education of displaced Ukrainians coming to Ireland.  I am determined, as I know the Deputy is, that these students will be given comprehensive and compassionate support.  The Government believes it is essential that access to education is maintained.<\/p>  <p>  I met with representatives of the higher education sector in early March to discuss their response to the situation.  I established a national steering group, which is chaired by my Department and comprised of experts from across the sector.  The group is overseeing the work of the national student and researcher help desk, which is a potential game changer in terms of streamlining our supports.  It is a key element in our response and is acting as a single national contact point for displaced Ukrainian students and researchers looking to study here.  We know that navigating the higher education system can be a challenge for anybody.  Having one single contact point staffed by admissions officers and guidance counsellors from across the sector is important.  It will assist students to make informed decisions about their continued education before the new academic year commences.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there already have been 250 calls and emails to the help desk from students and researchers looking for assistance.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, at the request of the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science, Ireland has committed to conducting the Ukrainian higher education entrance examinations this summer for students looking to access higher education in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>My officials are engaging with their counterparts at the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and the members of the steering group on how best to facilitate this.

There is a contact point for that now in every education and training board, ETB, in every county.

We even see at primary and secondary level that people want to continue to access Ukrainian schools, as well as maybe attending Irish schools.  We are taking a very individual approach.  That is the purpose of the helpdesk.  Rather than a student going to a college or a one-size-fits-all model, the student has a conversation with this desk where the expert advice is and he or she will be guided.  The student could be in third year of engineering in Ukraine.  Is third year of engineering in Ukraine the same as third year of engineering in Ireland?  If not, how do we map that out?  I do not have an answer, nor does an answer yet exist, to how many of those students will end up taking up places.  The numbers of calls has been relatively small so far.

However, I will come back specifically to the point about whether there is a version of that scheme which could be applied to the delivery of student accommodation in circumstances where there is clearly a gap between the market's ability to provide and what students and their families can afford.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to addressing issues relating to the cost of education that are affecting students and their families, including those who are disadvantaged or experiencing poverty.  Obviously, the student grant is an absolutely critical support for students who receive it.  I have already made a number of changes to the grant scheme to help alleviate financial pressures on thousands of students and their families with improvements coming in September.  From the start of the academic year in September, all student grant maintenance payments will increase.  More families will qualify through the income threshold increase, and a number of students will see their grants significantly increase, by 25% or more, as a result of change to the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant, which is being reduced from 45 km to 30 km.  It is critical that the student grant scheme continues to evolve to reflect the financial reality that affects learners.  The Deputy is right.  When we conducted the student grant review, it showed that the single-biggest cost facing students was accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The review also showed that is why student grants need to significantly increase.  It has made a recommendation that they need to increase by 25% to be at a level that is fully impactful for our students.  That is why I commissioned the review.  It will inform future deliberations on the direction of the scheme.  In addition to the student grant schemes, as the Deputy knows, students in third level institutions who are experiencing financial need can apply for support under the student assistance fund through its access office.  It assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to financial circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to accommodation shortages, I am very much aware of the difficulties faced by students in obtaining affordable accommodation.  I am glad to report that there were 970 new higher-education-institution-owned, purpose-built student accommodation bed spaces completed in the past two years.  Work is under way on site on a further 929 spaces.  These bed spaces are institution owned as opposed to privately owned.  As of December 2021, approximately 14,500 purpose-built student accommodation bed spaces were owned by higher education institutions.  Shortages in student accommodation reflect a need to increase the supply of all types of accommodation, including student accommodation, and I am working with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to see if there are some specific initiatives we can put in place to help colleges manage to build college-owned affordable accommodation.  The Deputy raised an interesting point.  Is there a way the State can subsidise bridging that cost in order that we can get our colleges building?  A significant number of planning permission applications have already been approved for many of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900017#P00700","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1652955600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>The key point is that education is a right, not a privilege.

It is the State's obligation, in its own interests and in the interests of the students, to remove barriers to progressing in education to the highest possible level.  It is, in that context, frankly outrageous that in UCD we are talking about up to &euro;14,000 in accommodation costs for the new builds.  Even the lower stuff costs approximately &euro;8,000.  It is similar elsewhere.  If a student has to access private accommodation, whether it is investor-built or other accommodation, the rents are extortionate.  I will say a word about fees in a minute.  Fees are also a considerable barrier.  At the very least, we have to make accommodation affordable for students.

The first is that I wrote recently to all universities, technological universities and institutes of technology inviting them to put forward any local solutions.  This is a departure from previous policy.  They could identify an unused hotel or building that could be converted or modified to be college-owned student accommodation.

The sector now agrees that &euro;307 million is needed and if we provide that, we need to start to see fair play on a number of these important issues.  The &euro;307 million will drive down the student-staff ratio.  It is about 19:1 or 20:1 in Ireland.  The EU average is about 14:1 or 15:1.  It will get us to the EU average and mean that we are funding higher education at a similar level to Sweden.  It will mean we are investing &euro;2,000 more per student, per year in their education.  Five themes are set out for reforms, including access and better links between further education.  I give the example of a nurse who does a post-leaving certificate course, PLC.  We cannot have a situation where someone can do wonderfully well in a PLC in nursing and not get a place in a graduate course for a nursing degree.  There are five themes for reform in the group chaired by Professor Anne Looney, Professor Tom Collins and I, which will meet for the first time next week.<\/p>  <p>  Core funding is one part of the plan.  The cost of education is another part.  The Government has agreed to take a two-pronged approach, with a gradual reduction in the registration fee and a significant increase in the SUSI student grant scheme.  We have outlined a number of things that need to happen with the SUSI student grant scheme, including making sure the grants increase more in line with the cost of living.  The review reckons that the grants need to increase by 25% to get back to where they need to be.  We also need to make decisions about funding part-time students under SUSI.  We have started, in the budgets that we voted for, to increase student grants, reducing the distance that a student has to live from college to qualify for a larger grant and increasing the income threshold.

Inflation in the 12 months to April reached over 7%, the biggest spike we have seen in prices in more than two decades.  Workers and families are struggling.  They are seeing their energy bills soar and other costs rise.  We know what has caused this.  Many factors are beyond our control but others are not.  Soaring rents and unaffordable childcare are not beyond the control of this Government.  In many ways, they have reached such unaffordable levels because of Government policy.  The Government can and must respond.<\/p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in recognise that every household cannot be protected from every price increase but low- and middle-income households must be supported.  In this regard, the Government has lost control of the cost of living crisis.  Electricity bills have increased by 28% and gas bills by over 50%, the cost of home heating oil has almost doubled and rents have gone up by 12%.  Inflation impacts everybody but not equally.  Lower-income and middle-income households are hit hardest, as they spend a higher proportion of their money on energy and food.  <\/p>  <p>  The most vulnerable in our society are faced with choices they should never have to make over whether to eat or heat their homes.  Shamefully, the Government has not increased social welfare rates in response to historic levels of inflation.  The pay packets of low-paid workers cannot stretch from one month to the next.  Let us be clear.  The Government is deliberately allowing people to fall through the cracks.  Sinn F&eacute;in has for many months consistently called for a mini-budget that would bring forward a comprehensive package of measures to support low- and middle-income households. <\/p>  <p> This morning the Think-tank for Action on Social Change released its report on inequality in Ireland in 2022.  It highlights the fact inflation has impacted low-income households most and has been made worse by Government policy failure in areas such as housing and childcare.  It recommends what Sinn F&eacute;in has called for for months, that is, an increase in social welfare rates to ensure the most vulnerable in our society are protected and supported.  It also calls for an increase in the minimum wage to boost the incomes of more than 130,000 workers.  However, the Government has refused to do either of these things.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on the Government to introduce targeted measures to protect renters through a refundable tax credit putting one month's rent back into renters' pockets and to ban rent increases.  We have called on the Government to reduce the cost of childcare and of home heating oil.  These measures can be taken.  They are sensible, necessary and what families and workers need at this time.  The Government continues to delay, oppose and rule them out.  Workers and families cannot afford more delay or inaction.  They are looking for the Government to respond to an unprecedented challenge in their homes and lifestyles and to the cost-of-living crisis they face.  They are looking for the Government to take the actions we in Sinn F&eacute;in have spelled out.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Government planning to introduce further measures or does it continue to ignore the plight of, in particular, those on fixed incomes who have not seen an increase in social welfare rates during these unprecedented price increases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900021#T00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652958000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I acknowledge that we face a cost-of-living crisis, that inflation is at levels not seen in a very long time and that people are feeling the pinch and more than a pinch.  Many are struggling to make ends meet.  It is affecting households and families, as well as businesses in terms of the cost of energy.  People see it when they fill their car with petrol or diesel, really see it in their electricity or gas bill and increasingly are seeing it in other areas, such as groceries.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that those most affected are those on lowest incomes because they spend more of their incomes on food and energy than those on middle or higher incomes.  However, I do not think it only affects those on low to middle incomes.  People on average incomes of &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000 per year, working full time, are also being affected.  That is why the Government's approach has been to take action that is universal so everyone gets some help, including those on middle and good incomes.  However, we are targeting our approach in order that most of the support is going to those on the lowest incomes.  I think that is the right approach.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not support it for ideological reasons but I disagree on that.  It is a universal approach to help everyone and recognise that middle-income families are being hit too, but is targeted to give additional help to those on the lowest incomes.  <\/p>  <p>  I am a little disappointed in the Deputy's question because there was no acknowledgement in it that the Government had done anything to help people with the cost of living.  That is not fair.  We have had packages totalling &euro;2.4 billion to help people with the cost of living.  That is considerable and is more than would be the case in any one budget.  We had a tax and welfare package that kicked in in January.  Sinn F&eacute;in supported the welfare and pension increases but did not support the tax element of that.  The average couple earning &euro;40,000 each per year, we will say, would be thousands of euro worse off under Sinn F&eacute;in in terms of after-tax income than under the current Government.  The increase in the minimum wage kicked in in January.  We reduced VAT on electricity and gas.  We reduced excise on petrol and diesel.  We brought in targeted measures to help those who need it most, including the increase in the fuel allowance through two additional payments and the &euro;200 discount per household on electricity bills which people are seeing in their bills at the moment.  There is a 2% cap on rent increases, which means rent is going up between 0% and 2% for existing tenancies.  We have had reductions in public transport fares, which I think have been widely welcomed, especially for younger people.  We have had a reduction in the cost of school transport for families with multiple kids using it.  We have had a reduction in the costs of medicine and 92% of childcare services have signed up to free fees.  There was not a single mention of any of that in the Deputy's question, which is not fair.  It is &euro;2.4 billion and ten or 20 measures, including universal ones to help everyone and targeted ones to help those most in need.  <\/p>  <p>  I know I will hear back the usual rant for social media about how we do not get it, yadda yadda, and all the pre-scripted stuff.  I would like to see in part of the Deputy's response an acknowledgement that the Government has done something in this area and has provided &euro;2.4 billion worth of relief to help households with the cost of living.

For example, we brought forward changes to the working family payment and we also brought in an extended fuel allowance period and an additional fuel allowance payment.  We had welfare increases in January and, since then, there have been further welfare increases, acknowledging the fact that people living on welfare are being hit hardest by the increase in energy costs and now in food costs.  That was done.  It would, at least, be relevant for the Deputy to acknowledge that fact.  Welfare increases occurred in January and there have been two sets of further welfare increases since then.

Some people might say that is just Tories being Tories, but it does give an insight into the ignorance at the heart of the British bad faith when it comes to Brexit and the North of Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement is shredded and gutted.  The Executive has collapsed.  This has happened at a time of a cost-of-living crisis and while 44,000 people are currently on housing waiting lists in the North of Ireland, 270,000 people there are on hospital waiting lists for longer than a year and 670,000 people are in poverty in the Six Counties.<\/p> <p>This would not be acceptable in any other democratic society in the world.

The Government should be exhausting all international legal avenues to see its implementation; it should seek the suspension of MLA salaries while the Executive is suspended; it should harness the full extent of White House and EU power to put pressure on the British Government; it should seek the reconstitution of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference; it should at this stage be pushing for joint authority while Stormont is collapsed; and it should seek a legally defined role for the Assembly in the North to activate an Irish unity referendum.

It is obviously for her to confirm or deny them.  However we all know that Brexit, even with the deal that we have had, has affected people.  It has affected businesses adversely with many consequences, although I think without the deal we have it would have been much worse.  In respect of legacy, the Irish Government is very concerned about the proposals that have been put forward by the British Government in regard to legacy, amnesty and the non-prosecution of people who were involved in killing people in Northern Ireland, whether it was in terrorist offences or people from the security services.  We had the Stormont House Agreement.  We think that agreement should be honoured in regard to legacy.  We are very much of the view that whatever is done in regard to legacy in Northern Ireland, should be done with the support of the parties in Northern Ireland and crucially should involve consultation with and the agreement of the families and victims groups.  This is because many people are still grieving years and decades later because of what was done to them by paramilitaries and security forces.  It is they who should be at the centre of this.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the actions that we are taking, the Government is acting on two tracks.  As part of the European Union we are trying to negotiate with the United Kingdom in regard to the protocol, trying to come up with solutions that maintain the protocol in place and the benefits that arise from it, but in some way help to assuage and ease the concerns that unionists and some business people in Northern Ireland have.  We are working on that track in terms of how to modify and improve the protocol and trying to respond to some of the concerns that have been raised.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, led by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, we are trying to engage with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland with a view to forming an Executive.  Getting the Assembly up and running is very important and does not require an Executive to be formed.  That should happen.  An Executive should happen also.  I was involved for three years in negotiations around Brexit.  What was missing was a functioning Northern Ireland Executive, a First Minister and a deputy First Minister who could speak on behalf of Northern Ireland.  What we have now is five or more parties, each with its leader, each just speaking for his or her party or maybe for one community or part of one community.  As nobody in Northern Ireland has the authority to speak on behalf of Northern Ireland, it is important that we have an Executive in place in order that the Executive, First Minister and deputy First Minister can be involved and can be across any changes that might happen to the protocol.  That is currently absent.  That is really regrettable.  The decision not to participate in the Executive is entirely down to one party. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900023#V00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1652959200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>On the legacy issue, Aont&uacute; published a Bill last week, the commission of investigation (collusion by British state forces) Bill 2022, which would constitute a commission investigation into British collusion into the murders of Irish people North and South.

This is adversely affecting applicants especially along the N72 from Rathmore to Killarney and from Killarney to Killorglin.  We are talking about 22 of the 25 miles.  In 2012 the Department authorised the National Roads Authority, NRA, now TII, not to grant permission to planning applicants to access the national secondary roads if the road from which they emerge onto the national secondary road is not in the charge of the local authority.  This is very unfair.  These roads and junctions are every bit as safe as those that are in the charge of Kerry County Council.  Sons and daughters of farmers, landowners and people who have lived and worked their holdings for generations need to build homes for themselves on their own land to be near their ageing parents and to be near their cows in order to milk and calve them.  They need to live on the farm on which they work but they are being denied the right by the TII rule.  I ask that the TII restrictions be lifted where there is an existing exit onto the N72 serving these holdings, in order that the next generation will be allowed to continue living at home.  No extra traffic movements would be created as they would be happy living in their parents' home.<\/p>  <p>  My contention is that if a farmer is forced to build or buy a house at a remove from the farm, he will most definitely generate more traffic movements going to and from his outside home to his farm and his ageing parents who are in his care.  Many of these local roads are public rights of way serving several holdings, houses and farms.  They are the same in every way as those that are in the charge of Kerry County Council.  However, Kerry County Council does not now have the funding to take them in charge.  These people who pay every tax and abide by every regulation are being blocked from getting planning permission by TII.  I wish to stress that what I ask is that where there is an existing exit onto the national secondary road and where the site distance at the junction complies with the regulations, planning be allowed for the landowners' sons and daughters.<\/p> <p>The problem for all those who cannot get permission in respect of their own land is that they have no hope of getting planning anywhere near their own holdings because all the areas surrounding Killarney - Mucross, Kilcummin, Aghadoe, Fossa and Beaufort - are designated as areas under intense upward pressure.  That means there can be no planning for outsiders.

However, we have to get the balance right between proper planning and people's right to build their own homes on their own land.<\/p>  <p>  What we want to avoid when it comes to national roads is too many traffic movements on and off the road.

I agree that there should be a distinction between existing entrances and exits and new ones.

It is ridiculous that farmers' sons and daughters cannot get planning permission to build houses for themselves and put a roof over their heads.

In 2019, Ireland became one of the first countries to declare a climate and biodiversity emergency.  Many countries have since taken similar steps to acknowledge the systematic environmental, social and economic threats that humanity faces.  Ireland is one of the only countries in the world to include biodiversity in its declaration.  This deserves to be highlighted.  The global biodiversity crisis and Ireland's national biodiversity emergency are equal in gravity to the climate crisis.  While the two are deeply interconnected, they are also distinct and deserving of individual focus, not least because, like climate, biodiversity is an all-of-government issue that extends far beyond one Department or one ministerial portfolio.<\/p><p>I am proud that the programme for Government is one of the most ambitious for biodiversity in the history of the State.  Chief among the commitments it made was to review the status, remit and funding of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  The NPWS is currently a division of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with approximately 400 staff and 32 offices across 19 counties.  It is mandated with a wide range of functions and responsibilities, which I will outline.  It holds significant policy-advisory and policy-making functions in respect of nature and biodiversity.  It exercises a wide range of operational responsibilities, including the management and operation of six national parks, 78 nature reserves and a variety of other State lands accessible to the public.  This includes managing tourism and visitor amenities and assets.  It also manages a wide range of EU programmes, such as the &euro;20 million LIFE programme to restore blanket bog in the north west, Wild Atlantic Nature, which I launched last week.  This is alongside thousands of conservation measures across our national network of EU-designated sites.<\/p><p>The NPWS also has a broad scientific remit.  It is the principal co-ordinator of the national biodiversity action plans, an action under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as monitoring and reporting on designated sites.  It exercises a statutory consultee role in a wide range of planning matters, including county and regional development plans.  It also manages a range of regulatory and licensing functions, including the investigation and prosecution of wildlife crime.  It administers grant schemes to support NPWS farm plans, delivery of conservation measures and actions for biodiversity at local level, as well as invasive species control measures.<\/p><p>This is an extensive range of responsibilities but, as the review of the National Parks and Wildlife Service pointed out, &quot;the organisation is not fit for purpose and [is] not in a good position to deliver on its existing mandate&quot;.  This is a damning assessment.  When I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, I knew my most important task would be to respond to the biodiversity crisis and to create a positive legacy for nature, and that the review of the National Parks and Wildlife Service would play a key role in achieving that.  That objective was included in the programme for Government because of immense issues affecting nature in Ireland and the many voices calling for change.  At the time, the NPWS had undergone a lost decade, with funding decimated following the financial crisis.  Historical legacy issues such as EU infringement cases on both the birds and habitats directives could not be effectively addressed due to understaffing.  There were not enough rangers to cover the country.  There were deficits across all sections of the NPWS and morale was low.<\/p><p>Since then we have made significant progress, building on two budgets to restore funding to pre-2008 levels, at &euro;47.3 million in the 2022 budget, and restoring staff numbers from boots on the ground to bolstering scientific expertise.  I knew early in my tenure that it was important to see for myself the work that we do for nature in our nature reserves and national parks, with farmers, with State agencies, among communities and on the international stage in meeting our EU and global biodiversity commitments.  What I found over that time was a team of incredibly dedicated, resourceful and creative people across the organisation and, indeed, across the country who were getting on with the jobs of engaging the public and raising awareness, managing a vast network of trails and visitor amenities, out on the ground rewetting bogs, establishing native woodlands, protecting endangered species such as the curlew, corncrake and natterjack toad, working with farmers to implement farm plans, tackling wildlife crime, literally putting out fires across the country, gathering scientific data in the field, building impactful international partnerships and working collaboratively across the Government to deliver the strongest possible outcomes for nature across a range of policy areas.  These people are just incredible.<\/p><p>From my travels over many months, I knew that I had to match their unwavering commitment to the cause of nature conservation with an equal commitment to resource and equip the NPWS and to give those who work within the organisation the confidence that their work is valued by, and valuable to, the Government and people of Ireland.  Eighteen months later, what we have before us today is a strategic action plan, resourced and targeted, to renew the National Parks and Wildlife Service to become the respected voice for nature that Ireland needs.  Before I outline the main components of the plan, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to some people who brought us to this moment of hope for nature in Ireland.<\/p><p>First, I thank Professor Jane Stout and Dr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide, who began the process through the phase one review phase with a forensic analysis that incorporated over 3,000 submissions and interviews with NPWS staff, key stakeholders and the general public, alongside an international benchmarking study and an external assessment of the organisation.  This expansive and painstaking piece of work concluded in October 2021 with a suite of recommendations that reflected the urgency of the biodiversity emergency and the fact that nature has never been higher on the political agenda.  Their report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAs a country, we need to remove systemic direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, and accelerate the just implementation of conservation and restoration measures.  <b>This requires a process of reform,<\/b>not only of the NPWS, the body responsible for the protection of many of Ireland&rsquo;s habitats and species, but across government and throughout society. <\/blockquote>  <p>The work of Professor Stout and Dr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide was massively important in underpinning the second phase of the process, the reflect phase, which was undertaken by the former Secretary General, Mr. Gerry Kearney.  Mr. Kearney applied his considerable expertise and sharp insight to the challenge of NPWS renewal, with a focus on its internal governance, structures and systems.  He travelled the length and breadth of the country meeting staff, a very useful exercise through which he saw what they do on the ground and how it all interacts with the organisation&rsquo;s scientific, enforcement and policy work.  It is an ecosystem of sorts, in and of itself.  He acknowledged that although the NPWS was relatively small, it had &ldquo;an extraordinarily complex range of responsibilities&rdquo;, and went on to say that for any proposed solution to the challenges faced by the  NPWS to be meaningful, it must take account of the diversity of its functions and the complexity of its interfaces.  Mr. Kearney&rsquo;s work was vital in consolidating the work of Professor Stout and Dr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide in the context of the additional resources and funding levels restored by this Government over the past two years, and resulted in phase three of the process, renew, which forms the basis of my strategic action plan.<\/p><p>I am deeply grateful to all three independent authors for their patience, tenacity and willingness to go above and beyond what was asked of them and to get into the heart of the matter and into the heart of the NPWS.I also thank all within the NPWS who engaged so positively and constructively throughout the engagement process.  The publication of the reports and submissions is a validation of the time and expertise put in by them and by all from outside who have a foothold in, or care for, nature conservation and restoration in Ireland.  Finally, I thank my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, for his support.  I can say with certainty that in him we have a strong voice for nature at the Cabinet table, but also someone who has genuine interest in ensuring that Ireland plays a leading role in conservation and restoration internationally.<\/p><p>Cross-party support is vital if we are to address the systemic drivers of biodiversity loss and fast-track the process of ecological restoration.  The Green Party cannot and should not be the only party taking this crisis seriously.  The nature crisis is often described as &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;.  Each cut is a decision, and we need to make different ones, collectively, as a Government, as an Oireachtas, as a society and as a nation.  We must put nature first.  I believe that is what the public wants.  The people are way ahead of us here.  They know that we depend on the natural world.<\/p><p>I will now discuss the plan.  My strategic action plan for the renewal of the National Parks and Wildlife Service comprises a suite of time-bound actions that will fundamentally transform the organisation and ensure it is fit for purpose.  It will establish the NPWS as an executive agency within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with a dedicated senior management team and a distinct mission statement.  It will deliver a full structural redesign, including the urgent recruitment of 60 additional staff to key posts.  Critically, it will be properly resourced, with an additional &euro;55 million in funding over the next three years.  It will put us on a path towards a more robust, fit-for-purpose organisation that can meet both our national and international commitments for nature.  It will deliver a NPWS that is more resilient, more stable and better resourced, with a stronger identity and better equipped to cope with change.  It will have clearer core priorities and better direction of resources toward those priorities.  It will ensure better communications, both internally and externally, and a much stronger focus on customer service and delivery for the public and the citizen.<\/p><p>Furthermore, it will strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s ability to meet existing national and international commitments for nature and put us on the right path to deliver on the increased ambition coming down the tracks from the new national biodiversity action plan, the EU biodiversity strategy, the proposed EU nature restoration law and the new post-2020 global biodiversity framework that will have to be agreed later this year at COP15.  There are immense challenges but also immense opportunities that have the potential to bring significant benefits to all corners of the country.  My action plan will guide us through this process of change and bring us to a place where we can lead with confidence on nature restoration and conservation, on public engagement and enjoyment of nature and on the many areas of Government policy that interact with the natural world, and help us to turn the tide of biodiversity loss in Ireland.<\/p> <p>T&aacute;im an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il as an bplean seo.

I welcome the &euro;55 million worth of funding that will be put into the service and the announcement of 60 additional staff who will be recruited urgently.  I want to thank the Minister of State for that because I know that since he has taken up his position he has put biodiversity front and centre and that is important on this National Biodiversity Week.  It is not just this announcement of the review and restructure of the NPWS that was so badly needed; the Minister of State has been front and centre in ensuring that the Government and Cabinet, more than any other Government or Cabinet before, are starting to put biodiversity measures front and centre and in place.  We have seen that recently with the establishment of the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss, which will be so important to advising and informing us of how we address loss in biodiversity.  We have seen it with the budget allocation of &euro;47 million that the Minister of State fought for in 2022.  That is significant when it is considered that the allocation by the main Opposition party, Sinn F&eacute;in, in its alternative budget was a measly &euro;5 million.  In his first few months in office we saw the establishment of a dedicated wildlife crime investigation unit, which will be staffed with the recruitment of this extra staff, and we have seen a 300% increase in the local biodiversity action fund, which will make a huge difference on the ground, particularly with the Tidy Towns committees and their approach to how they look after their towns and villages.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen the recent announcements that legislation is being brought forward to give basking sharks protected species status.  There is a range and list of measures that the Government has put in place that make me confident that we will see a turning of the tide of biodiversity loss.  As the Minister of State well knows and as he alluded to, we cannot sit on our hands and rest on our laurels with those successes and the measures we have put in place.  There is so much more to do.  For example, we have seen the success of some targeted conservation measures, and the Minister of State has been touring the country to see some of them.  We have seen the Corncrake LIFE project, which has seen the number of corncrakes in Ireland bounce back and go up, which is a success.  We have seen the Hen Harrier project.  The hen harrier was on the brink of extinction in Ireland but with the co-operation of farmers, we have introduced a results-based payment for them, we have seen hen harrier numbers start to increase for the first time.  These targeted measures work but we need more of them and we need more widespread targeted measures for more species so that we can see more species have better outcomes.  The Minister of State mentioned the curlew and there are other wading birds like the redshank and the kestrel, a bird of prey the numbers of which are decreasing rapidly.  We also have seabirds that are under severe pressure, including the puffin and the kittiwake.  We need targeted measures to ensure these species survive and bounce back.<\/p>  <p>  Then there are those species that are quietly disappearing from our countryside, including farmland birds like the yellowhammer, which we do not hear much about.  We hear about the curlew and the corncrake but birds like the yellowhammer will meet the same fate as a similar farm bird, the corn bunting, which is now extinct as a breeding species in Ireland.  We need to once again roll out those targeted measures across the board.  It is not just targeted measures that will work.  The overall approach and strategy have to be right as well and that is where the upcoming agri-environment scheme, which is due to commence in 2023, will have to play an important role.  I know it is a priority for the Minister of State but I ask him to also liaise with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to ensure that, similar to those targeted measures I spoke about earlier, this is results-based and has proper outcomes for wildlife across Ireland.  Farmers should be rewarded and paid for putting wetland on their farm holdings or for planting trees and hedgerows so that we see better outcomes for wildlife, which is so important.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to see the roll-out of those marine protected areas, MPAs.  That would not only benefit those seabirds that I spoke about earlier but it would also benefit the incredible cetaceans, including whales and dolphins, that we are lucky enough to get in Ireland.  As I have consistently said, Ireland is a world-class location for whale watching but we need to ensure that those whales and dolphins keep coming to our coast to feed and the only way we can do that is by protecting fish stocks and by allocating and setting up those marine protected areas.  That is vitally important.  I must mention the National Biodiversity Data Centre and that must see an increase in its funding, remit and resources so that it can collect data.  Data are key to protecting wildlife in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the NPWS and the announcement of the &euro;55 million investment and the 60 extra staff, which is so important.  That will allow this organisation to restructure itself and to do what it needs to be doing, namely, reacting to wildlife crime at a much faster pace and ensuring that there are prosecutions when it comes to same.  It must react to the loss of habitat and ensure that it does not only react to the loss of habitat but is actively engaged and involved in setting up a nature reserve and in improving habitat and biodiversity right across Ireland.  In order to do that it needs investment and recruitment but that is not all that is needed.  Being an NPWS ranger, ecologist or scientist need to be valid career paths and that is something we need to get into our schools so that when students are meeting their career guidance counsellors and say they want to pursue a future in biodiversity or ecology, they are not just told to go away and do law or medicine but that they see it as a viable career path, which is important.<\/p>  <p>  I want to thank the Minister of State again personally.  I mention Clogheen Marsh, which is a marsh area near my home town of Clonakilty.  The Minister of State has visited the marsh, which I am grateful for.  About 20 years ago a group of birdwatchers had a dream of turning this marsh into a nature reserve.  Time and again they were met with closed doors and obstacles and their efforts failed.  I must thank the Minister of State personally for the fact that for the first time, they are starting to see progress.  We have seen funding sanctioned by the Minister of State for a year-long biodiversity survey on the site to inform how we go about this and we have seen funding for a feasibility study for the establishment of a visitor centre.  For the first time, this group of birdwatchers sees light at the end of the tunnel.  We will have a world-class nature reserve at Clogheen Marsh near Clonakilty and I want to thank the Minister of State for that.  Well done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900029#FF00800","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1652962800,"counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900029#FF00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1652962800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Roimh bhogadh ar aghaidh t&aacute; na h&Aacute;bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr&aacute;th&uacute;la le l&eacute;amh amach agam.

I say that with all sincerity.  As the Minister of State knows, too often when we face one another across the Chamber, we are disagreeing, whether it is on housing, planning or other policies.  I think that it is important that on the issues where there is strong cross-party support, we are big enough to acknowledge very good work and the provision of additional funding, as the last speaker mentioned, the provision of additional park rangers and the progress that has been made to date.  I also want to acknowledge the Minister of State's openness to engaging with the Opposition on this matter.  We met last year with the Minister of State's officials.  He gave us a commitment that he would involve the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the consultation, which he did.  I certainly think those of us who participated in that meeting with the review group will be more than pleased with the outcome at this stage.<br\/><br\/>Our position from the outset was that we wanted a strong, fully resourced and independent parks and wildlife service.  I think the actions that are outlined from 2022 to 2024 put us well on the way to achieving that.  For those of us who do not have a background in the area, and who in the previous Oireachtas were more likely to be dealing with concrete and bricks in the old Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government than natural heritage and wildlife, when those functions were moved into the Department it took us a lot of catching up to do to understand their importance not just in rural Ireland, but in many respects and more urgently in urban Ireland, because of the scale of biodiversity loss in those areas where emissions are having a much more dramatic impact on our natural environment.  Therefore, there has been a very steep learning curve for many of us.  We are pleased to continue to work with the Minister of State on the issue.  I made the point at the time that there are a number of agencies that we are very used to working with and that we would like to see the NPWS evolve into the same role.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is one that clearly, over a period of years, went from being a weak function of a Government Department to a fully independent service with very significant powers and a significant budget.  I think it has a huge impact on its areas of responsibility.  In the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage we have a long history of working with it in that respect.  Likewise, for example, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is another body that has evolved since the original Residential Tenancies Act.  I am only citing those two agencies because I am hoping, and I am sure I am echoing the Minister of State's own thoughts, that beyond the actions in this plan, there is a bigger and stronger future for the NPWS.<br\/><br\/>One point that I wish to make strongly to the Minister of State is that the appointment, and the process for the appointment, of the CEO is going to be key in this enhanced NPWS.  I strongly recommend that there is an open competition for the role and that the Public Appointments Service is used in some form or other.  I think it would be a mistake to appoint a senior official directly from any Government Department to the role.  That is no disrespect to any senior official.  Given the scale of change that the Minister of State is aiming for, I think it would send a really powerful signal if there was an independent, publically-appointed CEO to drive the change agenda that the Minister of State has put in front of us.  I am hoping that is something that the Minister of State or his colleagues can speak to at the end of the debate.  I also urge the Minister of State to continue to work both with the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I note that there are members of that committee here.  It is an issue that cuts across the different agendas of different Departments.  There is different expertise among the members of both of those committees.  I think the more of that collaboration, the better for all of us.<br\/><br\/>It is also fitting that we have this debate today because yesterday we saw the publication of the World Meteorological Organization's State of Global Climate 2021 report.  It is the third in a series of reports, including from our own Climate Advisory Committee and the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, IPCC, that are increasingly sounding the alarm bells for both the climate catastrophe and also the enormous biodiversity loss that we have experienced and are currently experiencing.  I thought it was very interesting that RT&Eacute; made it the main news item agenda last night.  That is a significant development.  However, for me, what is probably more significant is that the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, a newspaper that has been regularly criticised by many climate activists for promoting or facilitating a level of climate change denial, today published one of the most powerful editorials I have seen to date.  I do not know if the Minister of State read it this morning.  I think it is important to put that editorial on the record, only because of the publication in which it is contained, and the fact that it is the largest selling newspaper on the island.  The editorial opened with a quotation from the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres: &quot;A dismal litany of human failures&quot;, which was his response to the report from the WMO.  The General Secretary of the WMO, Professor Petteri Taalas, warned that &quot;Our climate is changing before our eyes&quot;.  The Minister of State knows this.  It has been his position that that is the case, as it is for many of the subsequent speakers in the debate, for a long time.  For that editorial to be the lead story of the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>is genuinely remarkable.  It shows that these arguments are breaking into the mainstream.  The editorial went on to state clearly:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe harm has reached record levels in the past year, with some indicators suggesting we have hit the point of no return.  The consequences of a warmer planet, with ocean temperatures rising alarmingly, are stark.  Acidification of the ocean has intensified, making conditions inhospitable for many marine organisms. <\/blockquote> <p>Last night, we saw on television the underwater images of the mass destruction of that marine biodiversity.  We look forward to working with the Minister of State on the legislation on marine protected areas when it comes before our committee, hopefully at the latter end of this year.  The editorial went on to state that:<\/p><blockquote>\tSea-level rise accelerated due to faster melting of glaciers and ice sheets, reaching an average increase of 4.5mm per year from 2013 to 2021 or more than double the rate recorded ten years earlier.  By now there can be no confusion that this is all about abstract changes in the weather.  It demands immediate changes in the way we live our lives.  As temperatures rise, people and animals are forced to move or change habits. <\/blockquote> <p>The editorial continued:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe have seen how displaced people can be thrown into conflict, being forced to compete for scant resources.  We have also seen how in the Horn of Africa millions are threatened with hunger due to drought.  In other parts of the continent, extreme rainfall is causing flooding.  The tragedy is, there is no known way to reverse the damage. 'The heat trapped by human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come,' Professor Taalas said. <\/blockquote> <p>It did not mention animals and wildlife, but the point could easily be inserted there.  For me, the most powerful thing, at the end of the editorial, was that it was very clear.  We know what the solutions are.  We have the technology.  The big challenge is whether there is the political will to accelerate those changes across every area of human life, social and economic, to ensure that at a minimum, we meet our Paris Agreement targets by 2030 and 2050.  I believe that the work the Minister of State is doing, both in the NPWS reform and with marine protected areas, is going to be key to that.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, I welcome this strategic plan.  I hope the Minister of State takes on board constructive suggestions I have made with respect to the appointment of the CEO.  We want to continue to be an ally of the Minister of State in this, both as a party and as a committee, in the time ahead.  We hope the Minister of State continues with his very open engagement with us to ensure what I think we all want, which is not only the protection of the biodiversity that we have but the restoration of so much of the biodiversity loss that we have seen to date, can be achieved.  If we are partners in that, we can do an enormous amount in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900029#FF01200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652963400,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I too thank the Minister of State.  We are in the middle of National Heritage Week.  I wish to commend the work of Kildare County Council's heritage officer, Ms Bridget Loughlin, and her colleagues, who have organised some great events not just this week but throughout the year.  Ms Loughlin is celebrating 20 years in the job this year.  Her dedication and enthusiasm is as apparent now as it was from day one.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of the Strategic Action Plan for the Renewal of the NPWS.  Investment in the service is long overdue.  The service was established in 2003 with the demise of D&uacute;chas.  It suffered greatly during the austerity years and only recently returned to pre-recession budget allocation.  As part of the new strategic action plan, there will be a full restructuring of the NPWS as an executive agency, along with the recruitment of 60 key staff to support biodiversity.  That is very welcome.  However, we need to see similar investment in our local authority staff, who are struggling to provide basic services.<\/p> <p>They are at the coalface of heritage protection and are best placed to notice the need for action as they work on the ground.  Objectives to be completed over the next two and a half years include 15 strategic actions that I hope will ensure that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is resourced and equipped and has a robust organisational structure.  The new focus of this service, its key strategic actions, new resources and additional staff should better equip the organisation&rsquo;s capacity to meet core objectives and to protect Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage.  <\/p> <p> We heard this week from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Biodiversity Loss session that Ireland risks turning into a ghost land for nature if abuse of land, habitats and species continues.  The assembly's conclusions will be presented in a report with recommendations to the Government as to what actions should be taken to protect what is left of the country&rsquo;s natural habitat.  Experts outlining the work of the assembly told the group that nature had already been pushed into a corner in Ireland.  Almost 65% of our land is agricultural land and approximately 10% of it is plantation forestry.  Approximately 75% of the Irish landscape, therefore, is relatively intensely managed and most of our biodiversity is in the other 25%.  <\/p> <p> The swift, that is, the migrant bird that used to be the sound of summer all over Ireland, has lost 40% of its population in just 15 years, which is very frightening.  Some species are able to adapt, like the sand martins I saw nesting on a raised bog bank at Umeras in south Kildare, with which the Minister of State is familiar.  Others like the curlew, which I heard for the first time in many years recently while canvassing in Mallusk, County Antrim, has not fared so well.<\/p> <p> We need to support our farmers in the conservation work that they do and to find the right balance between food production and habitat protection.  Our farmers get little thanks for the work they do.  We need to listen to them about how best they can be supported.  We need a proper plan in place to address invasive species such as rhododendron and Japanese knotweed.  We also need to review the list to see if species like cherry laurel need to be added to this and probably to have its sale controlled.  We also need proper regulation and checks to ensure that these species are not available for open sale.  <\/p> <p> Beekeeping is becoming an increasingly popular hobby which is great to see but we must control the importation of bees from abroad which threaten our native species.<\/p> <p> I cannot allow this debate to pass without mentioning the Curragh of Kildare.  It needs to be made a national park and rescued from the indifference of the Department of Defence which presided over the disgraceful dumping of God knows what during the filling of a hollow next to Donnelly&rsquo;s Hollow.  The Minister of State is aware that I spoken about this in the past.  It has not gone away and neither have I.  This issue needs to be addressed.  The toleration also of illegal encampments and the neglectful approach that the Department brings to this issue may not be done on purpose but it also needs to be addressed.  The Curragh is the heart of Kildare and it needs to be protected.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900030#GG00200","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652964000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to speak on behalf of the Labour Party in this very important debate here today.  In the first instance, real credit is owed to the Minister of State for delivering this plan.  It is a very good one and has great potential.  I also sincerely say that this is a great credit to the Green Party for ensuring that this particular initiative made it into the programme for Government.  Great credit is also owed to the Minister of State personally because we are now at the point where we have at the very least a two-year strategic plan for the renewal and redevelopment of the NPWS.  It can be a source of great pride for him also that, after many years, we are seeing a significant increase in the resources available to the NPWS from a current expenditure point of view but also from a staffing one.  That is something that the Labour Party has sought as the country&rsquo;s economic fortunes improved.  It is very welcome indeed.<\/p>  <p>  It is incredible to think that the vast spectrum of work which the Minister of State outlined earlier on which is undertaken by the NPWS has been carried out by approximately 400 staff over the past number of years and I acknowledge that additional staff are on the way.  We must see everything we do, not just in the context of the work of Minister of State&rsquo;s own Department, through the prism and lens of biodiversity and climate action.  That is not just a matter for the Minister of State's own Department or for the NPWS. It is not just a matter for every Department and Government agency but is one for everybody across society.  We need to take this issue much more seriously than we have done to date.<\/p>  <p>  I also hope that Deputies who claim to almost exclusively and uniquely represent rural Ireland are as concerned about this as are the Minister of State and the rest of us and that they support the work of the NPWS in the way that they should.  It is unfortunate that there are some who claim to uniquely speak for rural Ireland but who are not here this afternoon and are not participating in this debate, at least not at this point in time.<\/p>  <p>  There are certain elements of the plan which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister of State, if I may, in the limited time that I have available to me.  I note on page 7 of the summary document that the &ldquo;Government may also wish to consider the wider issue of the roles and functions of public bodies in relation [to] biodiversity and nature at this juncture&rdquo;.  I would like to see the Minister of State and his colleagues go further than merely considering this.  As I said earlier, this is a matter for every Department, every agency and every local authority, as well as for everybody across society.  This is everybody&rsquo;s responsibility and is a cross-society endeavour.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that we will have an executive agency running the NPWS.  That will give a degree of autonomy and independence to the service and will give it more heft and influence across Government, Departments and agencies.  I am also glad that there is also a commitment on the appropriate grading of staff, which is very important.  It is important that the Minister of State brings staff with him on that journey and I am sure that the Minister of State, the Department and the NPWS are corporately committed to engaging with the relevant trade unions to ensure that this process is robust, that there is significant consultation, and that this is done in a transparent way.  <\/p>  <p>  I trust that the Minister of State will forgive me for raising what may be considered to be a narrowly parochial matter.  I do so in the context of the plan more generally and the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to biodiversity, to wildlife preservation and conservation, and to its care.  The Minister of State is familiar with the work of Wildlife Rehabilitation Ireland, WRI, and I believe he visited its former facility outside Navan in the past.  It has now moved its service to an interim site in Mornington just outside of Drogheda, beside the Boyne Estuary.  I attended a public meeting with that organisation last Monday and I visited the site which it currently occupies on Tuesday.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is aware how dedicated it is and that there is not a stand-alone State-funded organisation dedicated to the rescue, care, rehabilitation and return to the wild of orphaned and injured wildlife.  He knows exactly what it does.  I was not certain exactly what it did until I had the briefing on Monday and the visit on Tuesday and nor had I knowledge of the amount of educational and awareness-raising work it does with veterinary professionals and nurses, as well as with the wider community.  It intends to develop the site on an interim basis and I understand that an application is going to Meath County Council very shortly.  I am also told that we could have a best-in-class, state-of-the-art wildlife hospital and education centre for as little as a &euro;2 million capital investment from the State.  I am unaware if the NPWS has a capital line of funding available to it or if there is such a line of funding available from the Department to develop facilities such as this but this is something that should be looked at.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is very much committed to addressing the phenomenon of wildlife crime.  It is an insidious matter and the NPWS and the Garda work closely together on those matters.  More work needs to be done.  WRI is dealing with the manifestation of wildlife crime and injuries to animals and we really should have a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime.  I ask that the Minister of State might take a personal interest in the work of WRI, to monitor this closely, and to work with me and other interested parties to try to develop that service as best we can.  When I read about this earlier this year, the wildlife crime unit only had one official on its books.  Can the Minister confirm if that position has changed in recent months?  We cannot have an effective wildlife crime unit with simply one staff member.<\/p> <p>I hope that within the additional quantum of staff allocated to the NPWS, there will be significant investment in the wildlife crime unit and that staff will continue to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, indeed, the wider community.<\/p> <p> The work the NPWS does with local organisations is really important.  I am aware of that work in my community and constituency, such as the little terns project in the Boyne Estuary.  The professionalism of the NPWS and the advice it provides are really valued.  We value the organisation and want to see it develop.  I thank the Minister of State for his commitment to ensuring that happens.  This is a good day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900031#HH00200","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652964600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, on progressing this hugely important piece of work, which was a key commitment for the Green Party in the programme for Government.  Our biodiversity and natural world have not been valued and protected in Ireland in the way they should have been in the past.  The Government has changed that and the renewal of the NPWS is a big part of that change.<\/p>  <p>  The natural world is under increasing pressure across Ireland.  The NPWS has particular responsibility to alleviate that pressure and to protect our national heritage areas, special areas of conservation, special protection areas, national parks and reserves.  Reform of the NPWS will give us the opportunity to resource fully the proper protection of these particularly precious areas.  There is a very important special area of conservation in north county Dublin along the Broadmeadow Estuary, which is an area rich in biodiversity but that has been under increasing pressure for some years from littering, fly tipping and pollution.  This is symptomatic of the disconnection we have seen between previous commitments and plans in this regard and the reality in local areas.  The missing piece is clarity of accountability and also resourcing.  These plans for the NPWS will significantly improve that situation.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, it is important for me to acknowledge that rural areas hold much of Ireland's natural resources and biodiversity.  The work of the NPWS makes an important contribution to conserving our biodiversity and helping to sustain the attractiveness and fabric of our rural communities.  The Government is committed to ensuring the effective implementation of its statutory and other responsibilities towards the environment and biodiversity and to achieving a climate-neutral future.  The Department's ongoing partnership and dialogue with rural communities across a wide range of policy and programme areas is a key part of realising this commitment to our shared environment.<\/p>  <p>  The NPWS has a very important role to play in regard to recreational access to our national parks and nature reserves.  My Department has a strong working relationship with the service, through Comhairle na Tuaithe, and we will continue to build on this.  The development of the national outdoor recreation strategy has benefited greatly from the involvement of the NPWS among its stakeholders and as a member of the strategy working group, particularly in bringing a focus onto environmental issues and the importance of our natural environment, as recognised in the Our Rural Future policy document.  The strategy places a strong emphasis on reducing impact and protecting our rich biodiversity while making the outdoors accessible for all.  This includes actions on dispersal of visitors from sensitive areas and the creation of guidance for outdoor events.  The strategy also aims to create a communications plan to promote awareness of the environment and responsible enjoyment of the outdoors.  The review and restructuring of NPWS is particularly welcome in light of the new national outdoor recreation strategy and the recognition of the importance afforded to our natural environment in Our Rural Future.<\/p>  <p>  This week is National Volunteering Week, which affords us a dedicated opportunity to celebrate and acknowledge the contribution of volunteers to society and to the environment.  I give specific thanks and acknowledgement to the volunteers who protect and nurture biodiversity across the land.  In particular, I pay tribute to the thousands of foot soldiers for biodiversity who are our Tidy Towns Awards volunteers.  That initiative is directly supported by my Department.  Biodiversity is an increasingly key component of the competition and one of the categories is solely devoted to it.  In fact, demonstration of a commitment to \"nature and biodiversity in your locality\" carries 55 marks for participants.  The competition has a series of special awards that add a new dimension to the initiative.  One of these, the all-Ireland pollinator award, is sponsored by the heritage offices and biodiversity offices of local authorities across the country, in partnership with the National Biodiversity Data Centre.<\/p>  <p>  In my role in the Department of Social Protection, I oversee community employment schemes, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, RSS.  There are numerous examples of community employment, RSS and T&uacute;s projects and participants working to promote biodiversity, undertake locally adapted conservation projects and tackle invasive species, such as Japanese knotweed and rhododendron.  These projects are operating throughout the country.  In addition, projects on greenways, maintaining and enhancing waymarked ways, agreed walks and bog roads, energy conservation work, village and countryside enhancement projects, bog and wetlands projects, and restoring ecosystems are all currently in place under the community employment scheme.  Earlier this year, I visited one such project with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, which is a community-led project in the Bundorragha river catchment in south-west Mayo.  Its aim is to develop and test best-practice methods in eradicating the invasive rhododendron species.  It is supported by many partners, including the NPWS, and, crucially, the small farmers who are RSS participants and are central to this important environmental project.<\/p>  <p>  Another example is Clonakilty area sports club community scheme, participants in which planted, landscaped and maintain Bennett's Mill Field in Clonakilty town, including work on the pond and wildflower meadow.  IRD Duhallow, a key development company in Cork, was one of the first organisations to include and build RSS and T&uacute;s participation into its LIFE biodiversity work.  For example, all 36 primary schools and four secondary schools in the area have been visited and programmes on biodiversity have been delivered by one of the T&uacute;s supervisors.  The latter led a full scheme of participants to support the LIFE programme, including work on the importance of water quality.  Community employment scheme participants employed by Athlone Community Services are placed to work with Athlone Canal Heritage Group on improving the biodiversity and water quality of a 2.6 km stretch of the Athlone Canal.<\/p>  <p>  One of my main responsibilities as Minister of State is overseeing the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which funds more than 600 community workers across the country in areas of disadvantage.  An increasing number of projects are being led and developed by communities that interweave social inclusion and biodiversity protection.  Under just one of  SICAP's key goals, for instance, it is currently supporting 37 community gardens, eight environmental groups, 20 local community groups with agriculture and fishing as their focus and 21 social enterprises in the environment health and food sector.  There are a number of projects I would like to namecheck, namely, the Inishturk organic community garden, Biodiversity Kerry and Galway City Partnership's Let's Get Galway Growing programme.<\/p>  <p>  The publication of this strategic action plan for the NPWS will help to build a more resilient, better resourced and ultimately stronger service with the ability to better protect our natural environment and heritage.  It is a significant milestone.  When taken in conjunction with other initiatives, only some of which I have had time to mention today, it is clear that our whole-of-government approach recognises that biodiversity is more important now than ever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900032#JJ00200","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1652964600,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for delivering this action plan.  I know an incredible amount of work went into it.  I am delighted to see the work that has been done on heritage, including natural heritage, and the move by the NPWS back to Custom House.  Today shows the wisdom of that move, which was decided upon when the Government was being formed.  I want to put on record the huge credit that is due to the Minister of State's adviser, Hannah Hamilton, and to Ciara Carberry for the work they did on the plan.  A huge amount of work has gone into it over the past year or so.  It is a fantastic result for nature.  Above all, I play credit to the NPWS staff up and down the country, who are passionate about their work but have struggled for years with funding and resource cuts.  That has been very difficult for them and I am glad to see it being turned around.<\/p>  <p>  I am lucky to live in County Wicklow, where we have a fine national park.  I have seen at first hand the work done by the rangers there, led by Wesley Atkinson, Enda Mullen and others.  I thank them for the way they engage with the community, local representatives and community groups and the work they do to protect and enhance our natural landscapes, biodoversity and nature in general.  They are a real credit to County Wicklow and I am delighted to work with them and to see them being recognised and rewarded in this way.  Over the past decade, it has been extremely difficult for them to provide the service to which they are dedicated.  They are passionate about this issue and have studied it and worked in this area all their lives.  The service suffered huge funding cuts over the decades and the staff have been moved from pillar to post in terms of departmental oversight.  That has had a real impact on morale and has been very frustrating for them.  Today, we see that being turned around as we look to the future.<\/p>  <p>  NPWS staff do vital work to protect nature, help us to understand the importance of our environment and how it impacts on us health-wise, including our mental health, and educate us on all the benefits of living in a clean and healthy environment.  What has happened to Knocksink Wood Education Centre in Enniskerry is symbolic of the neglect of and decline in our environment.<\/p> <p>The education centre is located in Knocksink Wood, which is a special area of conservation.  It is overgrown and the building is in a state of decay.  I remember when the education centre was thriving.  It was full of children, school tours, researchers and academics.  I did some work up there over the years.  I have hope for that centre again.  It symbolises that there has been decades of neglect but that we are going turn it around now.  I hope to see the centre up and running and thriving again, and children doing their kick samples in the river, looking at insects and learning all about the importance and range of nature and biodiversity we have right outside our door.  Sometimes we do not realise it.<\/p> <p> I also want to salute the great work done by and perseverance of Professor Jane Stout, Dr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide and Mr. Gerry Kearney.  We were delighted to invite them to a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I can say, without exception, there was absolute cross-party support and praise for the NPWS.  Members wanted to see further investment and expansion and acknowledged the important work the service does.  There was cross-party support for that.  Too often in politics, we hear kind words and support and people saying that they support you and want to do more for you.  Often, words are not followed up with actions.  Not this time, however.  As a Green Party Deputy, I am especially happy to see what the Minister of State has brought to the floor of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> I say to people who care deeply about the environment and who demand action to halt the losses, help nature and address the impact of pollution and pesticides, the loss and fragmentation of habitats, the affect of invasive species, the need for climate action and everything that has an impact on our natural environment and to those who call on us to inform, educate and help people to understand the complex intricacies of nature and how we are all part of it, rather than separate from it, that this is where we delivered on those promises.  This is the point at which we turned and faced the problem.  This is where we provided a fit-for-purpose NPWS for those staff who have struggled over the years.  I thank those people who pushed us to do it.  I thank the environmental NGOs who pushed us to do it.  I acknowledge their praise of this.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for never giving up on this green priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900032#JJ00300","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652965200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>The plans the Minister of State has announced in the strategic plan for the NPWS are to be welcomed insofar as they constitute a commitment to expanding funding and service as the need for an agency that is fit to play its part in our collective response to the biodiversity emergency, as the Minister of State has put it.  The establishment of the new directorates within the NPWS is welcome because we need less of a fragmented approach to biodiversity in order that the different sectors have a focus that is dedicated to them.  This structure needs to ensure that the wider sectorial commitments we have made as a country can be more seamlessly be monitored and implemented in a manner that takes into account our core priorities and the needs of those who face the challenges of implementing actions that cut across all State sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 11 refers to ensuring that there is clarity regarding where responsibilities lie, whether there is ambiguity, duplication or overlap and, most importantly, where gaps exist in order that they are addressed coherently.  I want to focus on this for a moment because during my time on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have noticed that multiple agencies are involved.  Mixed messages can be coming from each one on a common matter.  This level of disconnect between State agencies can have an adverse effect on the implementation of the policy in question.<\/p>  <p>  It can cause or add discontent among those who are effected by these policies or responsible for implementing them in the course of their daily work.  If the biodiversity and climate crises are to be effectively addressed, then those on whom the workload will ultimately fall will have to be informed properly.  They will need to be listened to properly and the manner in which the mitigation measures are rolled out must be thought out properly.  We and our environment cannot afford constant uncertainty which leads to wasted time and a poor response to the message.  I welcome recommendation 11 and I hope it will be acted upon, not just by NPWS but also by the various Departments.<\/p>  <p>  I also note the reference to ending the use of temporary contracts over long periods.  Full appreciation and use of people with desirable skill sets are a key component of a properly functioning service that makes full use of the knowledge that comes with these dedicated people.  We see in the health sector how services can get disrupted because professionals who have worked and studied hard to get their qualifications and then asked to work for returns that take no account of their value or the knowledge they have gained.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak in general about our carbon sequestration targets.  Nobody will be surprised to hear that we have a forestry sector that has been left to wither over the years.  There is still considerable dissatisfaction out there in terms of the licensing process and the various schemes.  This has led to the sector to consider itself virtually disregarded and, yet, it is the very sector that has a considerable role to play in absorbing and storing carbon.  The target for the afforestation of more than 8,000 ha right now is mere ambition.  It does not become reality because the sector has been ignored for so long.<\/p>  <p>  When we consider the values of the NPWS, we also need to think of our foresters who watch the deliberations of the various focus groups that have been giving consideration to their future.  However, the reality of the situation for them has not changed.  There are planning issues, of which the Minister of State must be aware, which are slowing down the progress the sector could be making.  I am aware of a plantation in County Tipperary which is ravaged by ash dieback.  The application for a reconstitution and under-planting scheme to assist foresters to deal with infected plantations was subject to the usual considerable delays.  It then had to apply to the local authority for planning permission to replant with conifers.  This forester faces years of work and investment being wiped out.<\/p>  <p>  That operator was confronted with a challenge that was not just a disease.  It was in dealing with the forestry service, the Department and the requirements of the local authority.  The process is onerous and off-putting.  It delays our 8,000 ha afforestation target and the carbon that would be absorbed if the structures were working right.  If people who are working in areas of the economy that have a great contribution to make to biodiversity are faced with a slow, complicated and demanding bureaucracy, our chances of success in terms of all the targets are reduced.  I thank the Minister of State for his time today and for listening.  I hope some of the aspirations expressed for the NPWS are replicated in all sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900033#KK00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1652965200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to talk about the NPWS and the wider issue of biodiversity, especially as this is National Biodiversity Week.  I acknowledge all the work that is being done throughout our country by individuals, community groups, tidy towns and local authorities when it comes to education around biodiversity and the on-the-ground work that they are conducting in this regard.  Every week should be biodiversity week.  We should always put that level of appreciation into our natural world.  I hope someday that we will achieve that in that biodiversity becomes so integral to who we are that we are constantly appreciating it to that level.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to acknowledge and thank the Minister of State for the work that he has done on the NPWS.  It was clear that significant reforms of the NPWS have been needed for many years.  Successive Governments have not only failed to give the NPWS resources and financing, they have failed to give it the focus it warranted and deserved.  The service has reflected that neglect.  I appreciate the efforts that the Minister of State has put in to attempting to address that and to reform the service in order that it can provide the incredibly important function that we need it to do.  I also acknowledge all the work of the staff at the NPWS because they are incredibly passionate about our environment but have not been given the support over many years to do that work.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past 25 years, the NPWS has been moved across six Departments.  Despite the Minister of State securing additional funding in the past couple of budgets, funding for the NPWS is still around the 2008 mark.  Even then, it was a low base.  A considerable amount still needs to be done with regard to this service.  The structural changes and recommendations that have been made by Professor Stout and Dr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide will go a very long way to creating a top-class service that we really need.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things that struck me about this, which I was very pleased to see, was the emphasis on our national parks.  We talk about our national parks as being iconic.  We use them to represent wildlife and our biodiversity and their potential but, unfortunately, to date we have not given them the emphasis that they need.  We have not placed wildlife or biodiversity at the heart of what the NPWS does.<\/p> <p>It is inconceivable that none currently has management plans in place.  When the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, puts those management plans in place, I hope nature will be the key priority for those areas and that they are given the resources to function as such.  They are important areas for tourism and recreation, but we need to get the balance right and to make sure that we have core areas within our country that are dedicated to nature which are highly protected.  Areas are open to recreation, but that needs to be a key focus for what happens.<\/p> <p> Since being elected, I have focused on biodiversity and climate, which are so interlinked that we cannot separate them.  We often talk about the principle of just transition with regard to climate.  We need to start talking about it with regard to biodiversity too.  Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan spoke about new career choices.  When people go to a guidance counsellor and mention they want to be an ecologist, they should not be thrown out the door.  When I went in and said that many years ago, it really was not seen as a viable job option.  We need not only to identify it as a viable job option, but to look at how we can bring those jobs to rural Ireland as part of a just transition so that we are not only enhancing our biodiversity, but also our local communities and local economies.  I would like to see that idea of a just transition being applied to biodiversity.<\/p> <p> It has been a pleasure to listen to the debates today.  Even over the last couple of years, one can see the emphasis that each individual party and politician gives to biodiversity has increased.  We should continue with that.  The Minister of State said that not only the Greens can be interested in biodiversity.  I want to assuage any of his concerns that that is the case.  The Social Democrats and I are passionate about this area.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State, the Government and Opposition parties to ensure that we give it the emphasis and protection that it needs.<\/p> <p> I would like to raise a few issues.  One is the sense of urgency relating to biodiversity.  We declared a crisis three years ago.  Our bureaucratic processes are slow to catch up with the crisis that we are facing and the speed of decimation of the natural environment.  We need to bring a sense of urgency.  I also raise the wildlife crime unit.  When I asked a parliamentary question about it, only one person was allocated to it.  I would like to see that increase.  I introduced the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, relating to basking sharks, last year.  It went to Second Stage last week.  The Minister is introducing statutory regulations to deal with that.  I would be interested to know where those are.  Time is moving on and we are going through another season.  We need to focus on that.  I thank the Minister of State and the Government for getting the national parks review to this point.  I look forward to seeing it progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900033#KK00300","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652965800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I am apt to quoting song lyrics in this house.  Today, an obvious one leaps out as a good fit, which is Joni Mitchell's &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;.  It goes, &quot;Don&rsquo;t it always seem to go, that you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve got til it&rsquo;s gone.&quot;  We cannot continue to make these lyrics true.  We cannot allow or precipitate the collapse of the biosphere that has sustained, shaped and nurtured us as a species and pave paradise to put up a parking lot.  We need to normalise the protection of our natural world.  We cannot look back and lament what we have lost.  Our natural capital underpins our social and economic capital.  It is essential to our very existence.  For all that I love that Joni Mitchell song, my favourite song is that of the curlew, a song that is disappearing from our landscape, which I hope my children and their children will live to enjoy.<\/p><p>I have spoken several times in this House about the imminent EU nature restoration law.  It must be ambitious, but it will be enormously challenging.  The EU law will have to dovetail with our climate action plan and the biodiversity action plan and must be met by similar ambition in the new Common Agricultural Policy.  This new strategic action plan will enable the National Parks and Wildlife Service to meet its current obligations.  With increased resources and its establishment as an executive agency, it should be in a far stronger position to support the necessary ambition to protect and restore biodiversity.  We need to begin to plan for the departmental capacity and resources needed to take on this challenge, restoring habitats at scale and addressing land use, land use change and forestry emissions.  Our land is our greatest resource for carbon sink and carbon sequestration potential.<\/p><p>Fast-tracking the recruitment of 60 additional staff into the NPWS is welcome.  As in so many other sectors, as we begin to face up to climate change and biodiversity loss with sincerity, we need to ensure that we have a qualified workforce to meet the employment opportunities created.  We must ensure that our schools and universities are delivering quality programmes of study and research and developing flexible career pathways in biodiversity and nature.  That means more ecologists, botanists and more environmental scientists throughout national and local government structures, throughout business and across society.  It means better-paid jobs for them to go into.  Entry level salaries for ecology, for example, are woefully inadequate.  We need to attract the best and brightest into this sector.<\/p><p>The programme for Government commits us to appointing education liaison officers in each of our national parks to work with schools across the country, to promote the importance of biodiversity and the natural world and to involve pupils in the work that goes on in our national parks, which is clearly an area of interest to me as a primary school teacher.  This will provide immense potential and opportunity for our children to engage in a practical way with nature.<\/p><p>The full organisation restructuring in the new strategic action plan is particularly welcome.  The NPWS will be more resilient, better resourced and better equipped to play its part in Ireland's response to the biodiversity emergency and deliver on its mandate to protect our natural heritage.  Just as with the climate action plan, our response to the emergency that is biodiversity loss needs an all-of-Government approach.  Resourcing the NPWS alone will not do the job.  We must look at all Departments, public bodies, semi-states and indeed civil society and consider how they function in respect of biodiversity and nature.  In the longer term, I believe we should look to examples such as in Wales, where consideration of wellbeing and the wellbeing of future generations has, by statute, to be considered in the decision-making framework of these organisations, but that is extraneous to today's debate.<\/p><p>However, one matter relevant today is a key action in the new strategic action plan for the NPWS, which provides the opportunity for Government to consider the wider issue of the roles and functions of public bodies in relation to biodiversity and nature.  This is a vitally important action with the potential to be far-reaching and systemic, which is needed to address fully the biodiversity emergency.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, said in his opening statement, the loss of nature is an issue that extends far beyond the NPWS.  This action stems from recommendation 11 in Gerry Kearney's report on the renew phase of this process, which states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t<i>Consider a wider examination of the remits of the broader constellation of State actors with significant responsibilities in relation to Biodiversity and Climate action.<\/i><br \/><br \/>This would establish clarity as to where responsibilities lie; whether there is ambiguity, duplication or overlap, and most importantly where gaps exist that they are addressed coherently so that the State&rsquo;s response in relation to Biodiversity and Climate action can be delivered coherently and effectively. <\/blockquote>  <p>All Departments, agencies and local authorities must meet their responsibilities, not least their statutory ones, related to nature and biodiversity.  I warmly welcome this new strategic plan and commend the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Malcolm Noonan.  I commend the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the independent authors of the review and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, for his significant support and obvious personal interest in achieving this milestone strategic action plan.<\/p><p>More than 3,000 submissions were made by members of the public in the initial phase of this process, which has informed this strategic action plan.  Our natural world fascinates and resonates with us.  The sounds and smells of our natural world can transport us to places far away and across time.  We are in danger of losing it all and in danger of undermining the ecosystems that have helped to sustain us as a species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900034#LL00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1652966400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the funding secured and on the implementation plan relating to this report.  The report is a credit to them, their advisers and the Department.  Yesterday, I was struck by Deputy Whitmore's comment to the effect that the NPWS has moved around seven different locations.  At least it now has a permanent home and can lay down roots.<\/p>  <p>  The original report should be required reading for everyone, not just in the context of the NPWS.  It highlighted dysfunction within that service, but it should be applied to every organisation.  Every State body could do with a similar report.  We had the pleasure of having the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, with us in County Mayo last Friday.  He launched National Biodiversity Week at Enniscoe House just outside Crossmolina.  We got to see the NPWS staff in County Mayo in action there.  They do superb work.  They are absolutely dedicated to their work and are pragmatic in dealing with the challenges.  The Minister of State got to see all that first-hand.<\/p>  <p>  I will put on record once again my concerns around the naming issue at Wild Nephin National Park.  Ballycroy should be part of the name.  For example, it could be Wild Nephin Ballycroy National Park.  That is a local demand.  The NPWS has chosen to ignore it.  That is not the way to build up alliances.  It may seem small but this is a national park where, as in most cases, the land was given by local landowners in view of the challenge that is faced and in view of the principles of nature.  There should be a much better system.  National parks are referred to in the report.  Nearly 14% of our national territory is designated for nature conservation and 90% of that is privately owned.  That points to a need for better communication and co-operation with landowners and farm organisations.  I do not think it is particularly well dealt with in the report.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for a better sense of understanding and partnership regarding Natura.  Some 25 years later, the special areas of conservation and all the regulations relating to them, the designations and the Natura 2000 network continue to be very challenging for local communities.  On the ongoing day-to-day management of special areas of conservation and Natura 2000 sites, the 2019 EPA report suggested that 85% of our protected habitats were in unfavourable condition.  Considering that the special areas of conservation and Natura legislation has been with us for so many years, we have to look in on what is being done in the day-to-day management of this land.  Landowners are making significant sacrifices, particularly small farmers in the hill communities, yet the biodiversity of the land they have sacrificed and that they are not farming commercially is deteriorating.  We must look to the ongoing policy of managing the land and how it is being controlled.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned the area of Wild Nephin National Park at Ballycroy.  The NPWS is to be really congratulated on the way it is developing that park out of the box.  The Mayo Dark Skies initiative is led by a voluntary committee based out of Newport.  The NPWS has developed it in partnership with the local community.  The dark skies initiative is gathering great steam and shows to people the value of biodiversity and of protecting our lands.  It gives people a very innovative way of accessing and engaging in it.  That is what we need to see more of.  I join colleagues in commending all the various bodies such as Tidy Towns, Ballina Community Clean-up and other community clean-ups that have put biodiversity back at the heart of community agendas.  There is also a role for the NPWS there.  It is all very well to put an education officer into each of the national parks.  There are only seven of those.  We need far greater involvement and far better co-ordination and support for the many volunteer efforts that are around.  The NPWS could gain from doing that and, equally, the various communities could gain.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate my congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister on this work.  Money does not answer all the problems, however, particularly when it comes to public service.  The outcomes need to be tracked.  We have thrown money at many situations and not got the desired outcomes.  I urge the Ministers not to let that happen here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900035#MM00100","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1652966400,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.  I will begin by acknowledging all the communities out there.  There are very many across my own constituency and they are growing daily.  They are really engaged and energised in direct action to fight to help repair and preserve the biodiversity in their neighbourhoods.  It is great to see it.  I want to thank Jane Stout and Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide for their review and their work.  It is an excellent piece of work and highlights well the problems and systemic neglect of our NPWS.<\/p>  <p>  I also think of wider, deeper systemic problems in how we interact with and protect or fail to protect our natural systems and biodiversity.  On the action plan, I make the observation that there is a massive disconnect between the scale of the crisis we face, the report of our chief agency with responsibilities in this area, the action plan and its timeframe.  For example, on the hiring of an international expert to benchmark the staffing levels, aside from whether we need one or not, when we look at the actions, it promises to appoint an international expert to benchmark staffing levels.  Their findings will be reported in December.  By June 2023, their plan will be approved and by March 2024 their findings will have started to be implemented.  By March 2024, all going well, we may see the beginning of the implementation of recommendations on staffing.  To be quite frank, the plan is peppered with that sort of corporate guff.  Setting up new directorates is another example, as is the proposal that the NPWS become an executive agency of the Department.  I understand that these corporate and structural changes may be needed.  When we consider the scale of the crisis and the scale of the failures, however, this does not seem to match what is needed.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of the crisis is something else.  The Minister of State is aware of that.  One in five of all species assessed in Ireland is threatened with extinction.  For bees and fish, the figure stands an alarming 30%.  Some 63% of regularly occurring bird species in Ireland are of conservation concern.  Those of most concern include the iconic species of the corncrake, the curlew, the lapwing and the barn owl, and now also widespread species like the meadow pipit, the snipe and the kestrel.  I was struck some time ago by a statement from an Irish Wildlife Trust representative, P&aacute;draic Fogarty, who told the D&aacute;il committee that: \"a cloud of neglect and apathy has smothered the natural world.  It is a terrible legacy that we are leaving for the next generation.\"  In light of this, I am not sure that a cross-cutting standing committee with an international benchmarked staffing expert is what we need.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the recognition of the dedication of the staff of the NPWS.  However, I am also struck by the neglect and political apathy that the report records.  There has been failure by successive Governments to afford even minimal protection to supposedly protected sites and species, which is really wrong and breathtaking.  Although I think proper funding of the agency and enforcement are really required and are a very welcome start, they are not the full story.  The biodiversity crisis fundamentally stems from our economic priorities, from an agricultural system driven by profit, big agrifood corporate interests, reliance on monocrops, the use of nitrogen fertilisers and the current cruelty inflicted on animals generally in the interests of feeding not people but profit margins.  This is intrinsically linked with the climate crisis and both require a radical break from the economic system that is driving the loss of plants and animal species and throwing even our existence into doubt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900035#MM00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1652966400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The context of this debate is the sixth mass extinction event, which we are currently living through, with a horrendous, dramatic, marked decline in biodiversity.  Some 85% of Ireland's protected habitats are in an unfavourable condition, 46% are in ongoing decline and 43% of protected species are afforded unfavourable status.  This biodiversity crisis is part of the rift opened up between humanity and nature by the economic system of capitalism, the organisation of production and agriculture on the basis of profit as opposed to people's needs and our relationship with nature.<\/p>  <p>  The Stout-&Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide report is excellent.  It reveals the reality of the crisis we face and the neglect of the NPWS by successive Governments.<\/p>  <p>The report correctly compliments the staff at the heart of the NPWS, describing them as \"dedicated, passionate and knowledgeable\", but also makes the point that they \"have been neglected for decades, in a political system that did not value nature and biodiversity\".  The report is absolutely damning.<\/p> <p> At the time of the issuing of the report, the NPWS had only 354 staff.  That number has now risen to about 400 but that is far short of the 670 in the Danish Nature Agency, for example.  Denmark has a similar population but a protected area one sixth the size of ours.  It has 2,000 sq. km by comparison with Ireland's 12,000 sq. km.  In other words, Denmark is ten times more staff per square kilometre of protected area than Ireland.  Going on the estimates in the report, it would cost less than &euro;17 million to bring the staffing level up to the Danish level.  This is a fraction of the amount given to the horse and greyhound industries every single year.  That the strategic plan does not contemplate even the minimal step on staffing that I propose is very revealing of the State's priorities for nature and animal welfare, even with the Green Party in government.<\/p> <p> Another point that jumps out from the report is that 90% of the sites designated for nature production are privately owned and therefore not managed by the NPWS or protected by its rangers.  The report states, \"Ireland does not have a comprehensive policy or system for management planning and delivery of conservation measures for most of its Natura 2000 sites.\" That is really shocking.  It effectively means nature protection has been privatised to landowners.  This has been an unmitigated disaster.  Of course, many small farmers pay correct attention to biodiversity and should be paid for this by the State because it is done on behalf of all of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900035#MM00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652967000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>It is fantastic to see the publication of the strategic plan of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for the NPWS and the publication of the independent review that underpins it.  I am aware that delivering on this programme for Government commitment has been the Minister of State's top priority since he took office.  That the action plan is resourced by the Government, with &euro;55 million over the next three budgets, makes this achievement all the more significant.  I commend the Minister of State and his Department on everything they have done to achieve this outcome.<\/p>  <p>  Biodiversity is an issue that goes to the Green Party's very core.  Originally the party was called the Ecology Party.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, I would like to see biodiversity elevated as an issue across government in the same that climate has been.  The climate and biodiversity crises are inextricably linked and our responses must be joined up, but it is also vital that we address biodiversity in and of itself.<\/p>  <p>  Today we are seeing the impact of the many years of underfunding of the NPWS and the lack of focus on biodiversity more generally emerging as a potential risk to climate action.  The Minister of State is keenly aware of this and is moving fast and doing all he can to address the issue.  Substantially increased NPWS budgets and addressing staffing challenges are paramount.  The additional resources provided for in the action plan will foster greater confidence in climate-critical areas, such as the designation of offshore protected areas and the protection and restoration of our upland habitats and the species they are home to.<\/p>  <p>  Increased investment in NPWS staffing and the restructuring of the organisation along functional lines will also help restore nature in agricultural landscapes through highly effective programmes such as the NPWS farm plan scheme.  I realise numbers are currently small for this project; however, in the context of the EU nature restoration law and our objectives around species and habitat conservation, it is exactly these kinds of bespoke farm-level initiatives that will work to deliver mutually beneficial outcomes for biodiversity and for rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  On this note, last week's announcement of the &euro;20 million LIFE IP Wild Atlantic Nature project to restore blanket bog in the agricultural landscapes of rural north-west Ireland is designed to put communities at its heart.  Co-ordinated by the NPWS's scientific unit, it utilises results-based payment schemes to pay farmers for the quality of the habitats they create.  The average annual payment for the farmers involved to date is &euro;3,200.  This is real money, delivering a real impact for nature, water, the climate and people.  It is clear that a comparatively small investment in the NPWS can have enormous benefits for the country.  I hope the investment in the NPWS teams that co-ordinate and lead on projects like this will be part of the action plan.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke last week about some of the lost opportunities in the CAP strategic plan to address biodiversity.  While we know the CAP cannot do everything, it can definitely do more than is currently provided for.  I hope there will be some improvement in the eco-schemes, in particular, before the final version is signed off, especially for farmers in designated areas.  There is a huge missed opportunity in the CAP to make sure resources are used to support farmers to protect, conserve and restore nature and deliver on the Government's prioritised action framework for the Natura network of special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  By resourcing the NPWS, I hope there will be more capacity within the organisation to engage at all levels in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to influence and support nature-positive action in the next CAP and help the Department to ensure it delivers on Ireland's biodiversity obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Bog rehabilitation is now ongoing, which is very welcome.  From the perspective of the regulator for the Bord na M&oacute;na restoration and rehabilitation programme, it is hoped that the investment in the NPWS will support more and faster rewetting of peatlands, not just on State land but also across other parts of Ireland.  It would be great to see strategic alignment with the private sector, as we have seen in other countries.  A peatland code for Ireland could unlock substantial finance for investment in rural communities, supporting biodiversity and climate action at the same time.  We have already seen Intel piloting support for blanket-bog restoration in Wicklow Mountains National Park.  All these opportunities exist, and I hope the new NPWS will be configured in such a way as to seize them.<\/p>  <p>  It is reassuring to see that addressing wildlife crime has also been elevated in recent times.  It is great to see that there are more cases being brought by the NPWS and more successful convictions, in addition to more awareness of the issue.  The co-ordination of efforts on wildlife crime among NPWS staff across the country is delivering genuine results.  The recent memorandum of understanding involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also help ensure better outcomes for nature. <\/p>  <p>  It is a failure of enforcement that so many wildlife crimes have been committed in recent years.  Additional resources in this area will go a long way to reducing the number of these crimes.  Some 110 staff, including district conservation officers and conservation rangers, are working across the country to address wildlife crime.  Since December 2020, conservation ranger numbers have increased by 18%.  There are currently 86 conservation rangers stationed around the country to enforce wildlife laws, and they are supported by district conservation officers, regional managers and divisional managers.  I understand the Minister intends to further increase ranger numbers up to 120, which is a welcome development.<\/p>  <p>  It is reassuring that fines are increasing, more commensurate with the seriousness of the crimes committed, and receiving media coverage, again raising awareness of the law in this area.  In addition to fines, however, we need habitat reinstatement.  It is not enough just to pay fines; habitats must be restored as best as possible so that it never pays to commit a wildlife crime.<\/p>  <p>  I hosted the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in Limerick in 2020.  It was his first trip as a Minister of State.  I have seen his commitment and dedication and know how enthusiastic he is about natural and built heritage.  It is a credit to him that this strategic action plan has been delivered to such enthusiastic support from across all sectors, not least the NGOs and the wider environmental movement.  I commend him and the departmental officials on their hard work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900036#NN00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1652967000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, his departmental officials and the independent contributors on the work done on this review, which has identified several serious issues within the NPWS.  I hope these will be addressed by the steps taken.  It is great to see and very good news that a significant capital budget, of approximately &euro;55 million, is being allocated over three separate cycles, in addition to what has already been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to hear about some of the work, outlined in the report, on the hiring of additional staff.  That is very welcome.  I am conscious that I am here as a Deputy from Cork East, a section of the country that is not lucky enough to have its own national park.  There are only six in the country.  As a young person in the Chamber, I would like to see further investment and an effort made so that the south east, which is away from the west coast, where the majority of major national parks in the country are located, will have one of its own.  I am referring to the eastern side of Ireland, south of Wicklow, and the southern part.  There are many locations that I believe would benefit.<\/p> <p>I am thinking of the Galtee Mountains and the Knockmealdowns, or the Comeraghs near the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach's constituency.  The Government could work with the NPWS in the long run to see if that is a possibility.  Our national parks are extraordinarily important not only to the environment and from the perspective of promoting biodiversity and other environmental protection methods on protected lands, but also because of the benefit to the local economy and recreation.  I am fortunate to enjoy many local amenities under the umbrella of many State agencies, but not the NPWS.  That area, with a bit of work between the local authorities and the NPWS, as outlined in the strategic report, is quite exciting and much positive work could quite easily be done on it.<\/p> <p> This report will do a number of good things if the implementation is carried through on, including tidying up management, which is important, giving the NPWS a good platform to grow and, particularly, looking at new locations for national parks.  I reiterate the call, as a Cork Deputy and looking at neighbouring constituencies, to address the imbalance.  It is a long way to the west of Ireland or to Wicklow for many of us in my region.  I would like to see us working on that and procuring the additional budget.  I commend the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in that regard.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that much important work goes into an area of conservation .  I am conscious of that as somebody from a farming community.  It is not often heard about in here.  We heard the latest round of attacks on farming in Ireland from city dwellers in the Chamber a few minutes ago but we are conscious of the environment.  It is important that that is said.  We could put a strategy in place in conjunction with the NPWS to look at lands that become available neighbouring existing areas of special conservation.  For example, in Youghal on the bog next to our beach, a significant amount of ground has become available.  Much of it is marsh and there is much wildlife activity in the area.  We could work with the NPWS and Cork County Council to secure that land for the use of the State, for protection and for the promotion of tourism in east Cork, as well as the environmental issues.  It is right and proper that we look at opportunities to expand on existing assets of the State when it comes to the work the NPWS does.  <\/p> <p> It would be lovely to get a few extra national parks, though they are expensive and require years of planning.  Will the Minister of State take that message back to the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900036#NN00300","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652967600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>It is long past time that we had an organisational overhaul of our approach to national parks and the wildlife of the State.  The natural beauty of this landscape is not being protected and has not been historically.  What could have been a great ecological and economic resource has lacked the care and maintenance it desperately needs.  The health of our biodiversity is the key to our well-being.  It is a symbiotic relationship on this planet.  The health of the natural world and of society are tied together in a three-legged race.  For decades, they have not been in sync.  More than 40% of insect species are declining and one third are endangered internationally.  The rate of extinction is eight times faster than that of mammals, birds and reptiles.  The total mass of insects is falling by 2.5% each year, according to available data.  That is an incredible collapse of significant elements of the biodiversity of this State.  We need, as a country, to tackle that problem head-on.<\/p>  <p>  The first thing to remember is that we need partnership on this.  If we do not do it in partnership, it will create significant resistance.  The people who are first and foremost in that partnership are farmers and communities in rural Ireland.  If farmers are not treated as partners in this area, it will create resistance and opposition.  For farmers to be treated as partners, it is important that they can make a living and are able to fund raising a family.  If this is not the case and farmers are hammered economically, there will be a major difficulty in the area.  <\/p>  <p>  I will give a couple of examples of the manner in which not to proceed.  The Government's policy for sustainable energy historically has been to outsource large industrial-scale wind farms to national companies, which have come into local communities without leaving any benefit to them and built these industrial-scale wind turbines right up against people homes.  That has created massive resistance.  Instead, the Government could have followed the German model which allowed for communities to get the funding to build wind turbines of their own design in their own areas, get profit from those turbines and benefit from them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's response to turf is another example of building resistance in communities.  Instead of working with families on retrofitting houses that are dependent on turf fires, the Government went in with the ban straight away.  I appeal to the Green Party to understand the sensitivities and needs of rural Ireland in terms of being able to make a living and raise a family.  It is extremely important.  If it goes wrong, it will create further resistance.  The NPWS has not been funded or staffed properly and its structures have held it back in the past.  The NPWS has not worked with farming communities in the manner it should have and that needs to change.<\/p>  <p>  We in Ireland see the country as having a green and wild landscape but that is a significant distance from reality.  We have only six national parks in the country.  Connemara, Killarney, Glenveagh, Wicklow and the Burren are some of those.  We have no protected landscapes.  Germany has 400 protected landscapes.  We compare very unfavourably to other European countries.  We should be more ambitious in terms of biodiversity.  We should be increasing the allocation of land to those parks and looking at the whole area of rewilding.  Rewilding has unquantifiable benefits for biodiversity and our habitats and counteracts significantly the emissions created by society.<\/p>  <p>  The Knepp Castle Estate in England is an example of what can be done.  This large estate was an industrial-type and intensive farm until 2001.  It was not making a profit because the land was in a bad state.  It decided to revolutionise, change direction and devote itself to rewilding.  It did so in an incredible manner.  At very little cost, it allowed hedges, shrubs, trees and bushes to grow of their own volition.  It stopped using pesticides and other elements on the land and allowed cattle, ponies, pigs and deer to roam freely.  They drove the regeneration of the land and created a mosaic of habitats from grasslands to scrub, open-grown trees and wood pasture.  As a result, there has been an extraordinary increase in wildlife.  Species such as turtle doves, nightingales, peregrine falcons and purple emperor butterflies are breeding there.  Populations of other common species are also rocketing.  That revolution cost little, was highly effective and produced profitable results for this failing landscape.  They are producing high quality meat that achieves a better price at market and are allowing for camping, glamping, safaris and other business rentals.  Surrounding pubs, shops and bed and breakfasts have benefitted from the economic spin-off from that.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a project for every farm but in relation to diversification, which is important in agriculture at the moment, it is an option that should be supported more by the State.  I am thinking of the Dunsany estate that operates in my great county of Meath and the work Randal Plunkett has done there.  I am thankful to have had the opportunity to visit Randall and see the rewilding of the estate a number of times in recent years.  The level of biodiversity that has returned to the hundreds of acres that Randal is rewilding is incredible.  It has increased significantly the level of interest in his farm.<\/p> <p>He allows academics and students from universities to come to study the results of that rewilding.  I do not believe any Minister has visited that rewilding project even though it is the biggest one in the State at the moment.  I encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who is present, to do so if he has a chance.<\/p> <p> Obviously, such projects are not for every farm across the country, but I believe we can consider smaller farms too.  We can incentivise farmers to increase the biohabitats that exist on their farms.  For far too long, the European Union and the State incentivised the damaging of biohabitats.  Farmers were told to get rid of scrub, wetland and non-productive land but we should actually be encouraging them to keep such land.  We should be paying for farmers to do that.<\/p> <p> A policy that we in Aont&uacute; have held for several years relates to changing the sward.  I am delighted the Government has taken that policy on board.  We have depended on ryegrass, which needs significant industrial fertilisers to keep it going, for so long instead of allowing clover and other plants to flourish within the sward, which results in nitrogen being taken from the air and put into the ground.<\/p> <p> I urge the Government to consider riverine parks.  When cities grow in Canada, urban development is prohibited for 500 m on both sides of rivers so that those rivers remain as parks in the middle of large urban areas that can be enjoyed by families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900037#OO00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652968200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Cuireann s&eacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil deis ann c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; i dtaobh an &aacute;bhair seo.  I am among the lucky ones as I have a national park in my area.  There is no doubt that Connemara National Park has made a significant contribution to Connemara since it was purchased in the late 1970s.  It is simplistic, however, to think that we need national parks all over the place.  Obviously, Irish land history is very different from most European land history.  As a result of the land wars of the 19th century and early 20th century, most of the land went back to smaller farmers rather than going to big ranch-type farmers or, for example, what happened in Scotland with the clearances.  That always has to be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  There has been another and much cheaper way for the State to protect biodiversity, however, one for which it may not have paid enough, and that is by designation.  We should stand back for a minute and consider what designation means.  It means that the State comes in and, although it recognises that the land belongs to the landowner, it gives a big list of activities that cannot be carried out there without its permission.  Obviously, that has significant implications on other things such as physical planning permissions and so on.  In that way, the State controls the activities on a vast amount of land that far exceeds the size of the national parks.  In the case of Connemara west of the Corrib, for example, the reality is that 80% of that area is designated as either a special area of conservation, a special protection area or a natural heritage area.  The areas that are not designated are the green bits that people have been farming more intensively than ever.  None of it is wild.  All of it was farmed; every bit of it.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting to pay attention to the pattern of where people live.  It always strikes me when I see houses in odd or isolated locations that the pressure to survive was so great that every bit of green land was inhabited.  There were people living on the butts of mountains and so on.  There is history involved in all of this.  Comparing that with the settlement pattern in other places, if one tries to impose their way of doing it, that will immediately create friction.<\/p>  <p>  I hear about crime, including environmental crime.  It is happening.  There are people across society who carry out environmental crime.  My experience, however, is that the vast majority of people, particularly landholders, care for the land and biodiversity.  I often sat down with older farmers through the years and discussed their natural and indigenous methods of farming, many of which were supplanted by previous Government schemes involving land reclamation, mechanisation and so on.  The diversity they had on small farms was incredible.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to their knowledge when it comes to protecting wildlife.  I remember being on a deserted island where there was a project going on to bring back the corncrake.  The woman who owned the house grew up on the island with her father.  She explained to me that when they were mowing the field, her father would never have gone near a corncrake nest and that, at the time, there were about 100 pairs of corncrakes on that very small island off Clifden.  Thankfully, some of them have come back.  Strangely, one of the things they needed was interaction with humans.  If the place is allowed to go wild, as had happened on that island for the previous 30 years, that actually causes the demise of the corncrake.  In some cases, a carefully managed countryside is what is needed, rather than the dream that some people have of letting it all go wild.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of society in general, surely on this island we have learned that policing only works when it is with the consent and support of those being policed.   If one has to watch out for everybody in one's community, there will never be enough rangers, conservation officers or ordinary members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What makes it work in most of society, including the area in which I work, which is very lightly policed, is that the vast majority of the people there want the law to be kept, keep the law themselves and do not want law-breakers in their midst.  Similarly, I have found a lot of the people who have worked for the NPWS to be absolutely superb because they live and work in the communities, understand the people and work with them.  In that way, everybody goes forward together.  The reality, however, is that if one tries to come in with a heavy hand, one will not get half as much conservation as one will by working with people, particularly landholders, who have a significant stored knowledge of what is there.<\/p>  <p>  There are challenges.  On the other hand, if I leave my house and walk up what we call the seanb&oacute;thar - it is a walking route we built that goes on for four or five miles - I can see we still have a fair bit of biodiversity.  There is great nature.  Who are the ones who appreciate it most?   The local people.  I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Devlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900038#PP00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1652968200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government&rsquo;s strategic plan for the renewal of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The plan sets out an ambitious timeline for a full organisational restructuring of the NPWS that I believe is much needed and long overdue.  It provides a substantial &euro;55 million additional investment in the organisation that will allow for the recruitment of 60 key new staff to critically important roles.  The strategic action plan aims to deliver an NPWS that is more resilient, better resourced, and better equipped to play its part in Ireland&rsquo;s response to the biodiversity emergency on the national and international stages.  The plan will equip the NPWS with the organisational capability and supporting structures to enable it to deliver on its mandate in protecting our natural heritage.  It is important to note that the plan fulfils a crucial commitment in the programme for Government, providing for a significant investment in and renewal of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and their officials for preparing the plan and securing the necessary resources.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who is present, for his attendance.  I will turn to our constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire for a moment.<\/p> <p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service, as the Minister of State would be aware, works closely with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to protect biodiversity at important sites such as Dalkey Island, where there is a significant Arctic tern colony as well as goats and all sorts of other wildlife that is all protected.  Work is ongoing with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the local council.  <\/p> <p> The NPWS also supported efforts at Killiney Hill to expand the red squirrel population.  Back in 2012, for example,15 red squirrels from the Raven Nature Reserve in County Wexford were released into the area to supplement the local population.  This project has involved schoolchildren, which has helped promote awareness of the need for conservation and biodiversity locally.<\/p> <p> The additional funding being provided to the National Parks and Wildlife Service is very welcome.  Hopefully, this will allow a greater focus on sites like the proposed natural heritage area at Loughlinstown Forest.  This is an almost 20-acre forest and an important outpost of native broadleaf woodland in an increasingly urban area, but it has been largely overlooked for many years.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service needs to not only work with local councils on issues such as forests, but also in relation to biodiversity corridors.  Hopefully, with the additional resources it has been given, it will be able to work closely with those local authorities.<\/p> <p> Finally, as the citizens' assembly gathers to discuss biodiversity, it will make recommendations in due course, but in the meantime we need to take action and this national strategy is a very positive first step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900038#PP00300","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652968800,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Next is the Rural Independent Group, but no one is present.

The programme for Government promised the review, and we have it.  What is under discussion today is the strategic plan, which is based and arises from a report on the National Parks and Wildlife Service carried out by Professor Stout and Dr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide.  I am not sure why it was necessary but that was followed by Reflect and Renew - A Review of the National Parks and Wildlife Service but, in any event, we have the three documents now.  I found it difficult not to be depressed in reading the review.  I looked for hope and the hope is that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has put in plan before us.  The emphasis will have to be on implementation.<\/p>  <p>  I will quote a tiny bit from this.  I read every single word of it and so has my staff.  Let me just try to put it into context.  It states, \"Our overall conclusion, based on the weight of evidence, is that is time for change ... Ireland&rsquo;s natural environment, including its biodiversity, is in trouble.  It is time for fundamental reform.\"  It also states, \"We are in the midst of a global crisis.  Nature is our life-support system...\"  This is here for everybody to read but the statistics of loss are shocking.  It states that 75% of the land of the earth is very significantly altered by human activity, 66% of the world&rsquo;s oceans are experiencing increasing cumulative impacts and so on.  It states also that today human population and livestock comprise 96% of global mammal biomass and that 70% of birds alive in the world are poultry, mostly chickens, which is an extraordinary statistic, and that the risk of continued damage to global biodiversity is the collapse of ecosystems, including those agricultural systems that produce food; the lack of capacity to buffer and reverse climate change; and the increased global health risks, including further pandemics.  I suggest that everybody reads this.  The three reports have finally been produced following decades and decades of neglect.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which was set up in 1991, more than 30 years ago.  If any organisation was set up to fail, this one was.  I want to pay public tribute to the 400 staff throughout the country in 32 locations in 19 counties.  I do not know how they have continued with years of neglect and underfunding.  None of these are my words.  These are the words of Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide.  I would not think he was a radical, nor Professor Stout.  Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide has been long part of the establishment and a respected individual.  What he said here is absolutely damning.  We ignore it at our peril.<\/p>  <p>  Let me read what they said on funding, and this is directly from the report.  There is chronic underinvestment.  It stated, \"The NPWS is inadequately resourced to function to deliver its remit.\"  It was particularly hit by the 2008 financial crisis, after which there was a 70% reduction in funding.  This underfunding persisted, unchanged, until 2020.  Even the turf compensation fund, which was very welcome, had to come out of the National Parks and Wildlife Service budget, without any additional funding.  In addition, over the years, while under-resourcing and underfunding it, we increased its remit, giving it an absolutely impossible job.<\/p>  <p>  I will go back to statistics on the environment globally, followed by statistics on Ireland.  As I said, 70% of birds alive are poultry.  Can one imagine that?  That is what we have come too &ndash; mostly chickens.  Some 75% of the land of the earth is very significantly altered and, as I said, 66% of the oceans.  Specifically on Ireland, about 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s landscape is intensively managed &ndash; 65% agricultural land and 10% forestry.  According to Ferdia Marnell of the National Parks and Wildlife Service at the first meeting of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Biodiversity in May, most of Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity in the other 25% is shoved into a corner.  Some 85% of Ireland&rsquo;s protected habitats were in an unfavourable condition and 43% of protected species were in an unfavourable status.<\/p>  <p>  I am running out of time to give all of these statistics, but what really jumps off the page is, notwithstanding that we set it up to fail, that we set it up in complete opposition to the policy of the Government.  While the National Parks and Wildlife Service is responsible for delivering on a range of national and international policies and agreements, these are implemented within a national policy context with a strategic focus on increased production and intensification.  Therefore, one policy is completely and utterly at odds with the other.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that finally language means something and we are now actually going to do something in respect of this.  Different songs were quoted today, and I will quote, \"It&rsquo;s Now or Never\".  We have no further window of opportunity.  We know that from the meteorological organisation and from the ongoing reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  We can no longer stand here and stay we did not know.  We can longer stand here and leave the National Parks and Wildlife Service to fail.  It has taken a biodiversity crisis and a climate change crisis to make us examine the National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p>  <p>  I have sat with Deputies where the National Parks and Wildlife Service was denigrated at a time when-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900039#QQ00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1652968800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900039#QQ00700","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1652968800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thought I was getting a tiny bit of leniency, but perhaps I am not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900039#QQ00800","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1652968800,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The Deputy can continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900039#QQ00900","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1652968800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I am almost finished, in any event.<\/p><p>Certainly, it is now or never.

This is a &euro;55 million plan that fulfils an important commitment in the programme for Government and it will be a very positive result for Irish nature.<\/p>  <p>  I want to turn to some of the contributions.  Deputy Whitmore&rsquo;s love of nature and biodiversity shines through in many conversations I have had with her in the House and in committee.  She mentioned wildlife crime and is concerned about its staffing in the National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p> <p>There are 110 staff, including district conservation officers and conservation rangers, who are located across the country and who lead on the enforcement of wildlife laws and on bringing prosecutions.  There is also provision for an additional 33 conservation rangers and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, hopes to fill these places as soon as possible.  These regional staff are supported by a central team across a regulatory and licensing unit in a hub-and-spoke model.  Therefore, one can add another couple of zeros to the one staff member in wildlife crime enforcement who Deputy Whitmore mentioned.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also referred to regulations for the protection of the basking shark.  On this specific issue, I can confirm that the draft regulations have been submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, and that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is hoping that this process will complete as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke passionately about nature.  The Deputy asked that a Minister should visit the rewilding project at Dunsany.  In fact, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has already visited Dunsany and had some fascinating conversations about the approach that is being taken there.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government committed us to reviewing the remit, status and funding of the NPWS.  That independent, multiphase review was completed in February 2022.  It culminated in 15 key recommendations to renew the NPWS and make it a more resilient and more effective organisation fit to meet the challenges of this century.  The strategic action plan, approved by the Government on Tuesday, 3 May, is designed to deliver on those recommendations and its implementation is a key priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and all my colleagues across the Government.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the hard work of the independent authors who undertook the research and analysis and made the recommendations that underpin the strategic action plan.  Professor Jane Stout chaired the first phase of the review, which comprised a comprehensive consultation with external stakeholders, staff and the public, an examination of the challenges and struggles the organisation is grappling with and an identification of some of the gaps that may be inhibiting the NPWS from delivering effectively on its mandate.  The former Secretary General, Mr. Gerry Kearney, conducted the final phases of the review and brought it to completion by drawing all of the information together to make comprehensive and expert recommendations on the appropriate organisational structure for the NPWS and to provide an in-depth analysis of its governance, resourcing, communications and systems.  Mr. Kearney's work also reflects the significant resourcing gains and organisational changes in recent years, and sets out a clear pathway to build on these positive developments and ensure the NPWS is fit for purpose and can deliver on its core mandate in the coming years and decades.<\/p> <p> In summary, the independent review concludes that a substantial renewal and internal restructuring of the NPWS is required.  Fifteen specific recommendations are made, which form the basis for the action plan.  The review concludes that a substantial renewal and internal restructuring of the NPWS is now required.  I will briefly go through these 15 recommendations, which form the basis of the action plan.<\/p> <p> Starting with improving the governance, the review recommends establishing the NPWS as an executive agency within the Government that will secure a dedicated top management team, distinct mission statement, priorities and resources for the NPWS, while maintaining close direct reporting and accountability links to the Department, the Minister and the Government, as well as eliminating duplication by capitalising on efficiencies in terms of access to departmental corporate service, expertise and supports.<\/p> <p> The review recommends a restructure of the NPWS.  This is a change to the structure in order that its internal structure reflects the functions that it is meant to carry out, and, of course, those have changed over time.  The main functions of the restructured NPWS will be conservation and protection; scientific advice and research; parks and reserves; engagement, corporate and specialist supports; and legislation, licensing and regulation.<\/p> <p> The review also recommends reconfiguring the top management team within the restructured NPWS and assigning that team to develop, as an urgent and immediate priority, a dedicated organisational strategy statement.  In addition, the review recommends establishing permanent standing committees, on a cross-functional basis across the new directorates, to address long-standing, multifaceted, complex matters.<\/p> <p> The review also looked at the people who are involved in the NPWS.  It recommends a fundamentally overhaul HR capability and practice within the NPWS.  The HR function for the NPWS should rest with a dedicated person.  Recruitment to NPWS specialist and industrial roles should be overhauled and standardised, the use of temporary contracts over long periods should end and advertised roles should be graded correctly in order that candidates within an appropriate band in terms of skill set and level of experience are encouraged to apply.  There also will be appropriate career structures developed for industrial staff.<\/p> <p> The review suggests setting up an expert group, drawing on international expertise in organisations with a similar remit to the NPWS, to establish the human resourcing requirements of the NPWS on an international, best-practice basis.<\/p> <p> The review advises bringing forward legislation to provide updated and stronger statutory underpinnings for the National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p> <p> The review addresses the communications.  It is important that any organisation can clearly communicate with the public and with the rest of the Government.  The review recommends that external communications by the NPWS should be professionalised and should prioritise a vigorous and timely engagement with social and other media.<\/p> <p> The review recommends putting in place a new, renewed and improved programme of engagement, awareness and education by the NPWS as part of a wider strategy to present an authoritative, credible and compelling voice for nature in the State.<\/p> <p> The information and communications technology, ICT, function has to be reformed.  The chief information officer, CIO, office in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has brought forward a four-stage process and pathway to transform ICT within the NPWS over the next three years.<\/p> <p> The review also looks at biodiversity and climate agencies and, because there are a number of these, how do they interact with the NPWS.  There are recommendations in that regard, and on how the NPWS should engage with other public bodies of a broader nature outside of this sector to help ensure that each is playing its own part and according to its remit and responsibilities.<\/p> <p> The review recommends recruiting a number of key posts in the NPWS immediately, additional to the filling of current vacancies, where these are needed to mitigate critical risks in the interests of the State.<\/p> <p> The review recommends the grading of technical and regional posts by reference to comparable posts across the Irish public service.  Following on the findings of the benchmarking of the staffing of the NPWS by reference to international comparators, the grading of technical and regional posts should be assessed by reference to similar in the Irish public service.<\/p> <p> Lastly, the review recommends establishing a new engagement, corporate and specialist supports directorate.  This will create a resilient corporate spine for the NPWS, which can efficiently interface with the corporate function of the Department, thereby improving critical internal services in relation to HR, information technology, IT, procurement etc., leading out on better engagement with external stakeholders, as well as equipping the NPWS of the future to cope better with departmental changes.<\/p> <p> The NPWS has a proud history and, despite being a relatively small organisation of some 400 people, carries a complex range of responsibilities ranging from significant policy and advisory functions to operational responsibilities in the national parks, conservation, enforcement, licensing, biodiversity and being a statutory consultee on planning.<\/p> <p> The organisation has been sustained through many years by a truly dedicated and expert team of people.  For them too, the plan will provide the momentum to build on the significant gains we have been able to secure for the organisation in the past two budgets, bringing its funding this year, for the first time since the financial crisis, back to pre-2008 levels.<\/p> <p> With the implementation of the strategic action plan, the future of the NPWS now looks bright.  Given the times we are in, we will need the NPWS to be strong, resilient, accountable, fit for purpose and able to look forward.  The renewal programme in the action plan, the significantly increased investment and the immediate recruitment to critical posts all demonstrate beyond doubt the Government's strong commitment to our natural heritage, to biodiversity, and to the NPWS as an organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900039#QQ01400","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Compensation) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1652970000,"counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900041#SS00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652970000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652970000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this legislation because it is at least 15 years since I first raised the necessity for it in the House.  Many moons have gone by since, as they say, but the necessity remained constant.  My concern arises from meeting members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the years, many of whom had ongoing and outstanding issues in this regard and were concerned that there seemed to be no resolution.  I thank in particular the current Minister for bringing forward the current legislation, resolving any outstanding matters and setting up structures to give protection to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that any police force needs and expects for many reasons.<\/p>  <p>  We live in an increasingly violent society and members of the police in every country are coming under greater pressure.  They are in danger of attack, of losing limbs and of being incapacitated in a serious way, and this needs to be compensated for.  We have waited a long time for the legislation to come into being but that does not remove in any way the necessity for its existence.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the reason for the Bill.  The membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have families, responsibilities, mortgages and ongoing and preset calls on their salaries.  As they have no control over that, when something happens that prevents them from working or reduces the degree to which they can work, there is a need to recognise it.  There is also a need to put in place legislation to cater for this.  There is a need for the protection of those people in the public sector whose well-being and sometimes their lives, as we have seen, have been in danger from their efforts in the workplace.  This legislation is therefore in response to ever-increasing demands.  I hope it will make a serious impact.<\/p>  <p>  I have said already we live in an increasingly violent society.  Every town and city in this country is subject to the ravages of drugs.  To deal with that, the police force must be able to interact with people on a regular basis and they should not have to put their lives or limbs at risk when intervening.  That is the way it has been and it is the way it continues.  In order to tackle that aspect of crime - the drugs problem - there is a need for a clear indication on the part of the State that it will support the forces of law and order that carry out such work on its behalf.<\/p>  <p>  For example, one can scarcely walk in any direction in the evening or at night in this city without being accosted by people under the influence of drugs.  It is a sad event and it should not happen but it does.  The members of the public who are concerned about this bring it to our attention on a regular basis.  We must also recognise that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are expected to interact with people and prevent incidents are at risk as well.  The police force itself is at risk.  In any country where this happens, special measures have had to be taken.  I hope that with this legislation, we ensure members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na injured in any way during the course of carrying out their functions get recompense quickly.  It is important.  Once the legislation passes its provisions should come into operation quickly and do the job for which they are intended.<\/p>  <p>  Going further, the ever-increasing problem of drugs and drug violence can be seen by everybody.  It is committed against women by men and women.  It is committed by young and old.  It used to be a pleasure to walk in the streets anywhere in the capital city but now one is accosted by people either promoting their drugs or looking for new supplies of drugs.  That cannot continue and it must be challenged.  Our society is at risk as a result of this activity and it cannot be properly challenged unless we properly pay garda&iacute; and prevent incidents where members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our police force, are accosted, endangered or injured.<\/p>  <p>  In another branch of the Defence Forces, there is a position I cannot and will never understand.  A member injured in the course of duty may find his or her pension reconstructed in such a way as for the State to take back any award that the member may have received because of injury.  That is an appalling process but it has operated here for years in another branch of the Defence Forces, which I will deal with in due course again.  This is an attempt by the State to second-guess the Judiciary, which would have made an award ten, 15 or 20 years ago, for example.  The idea is that the award should not have been made at all, or otherwise why would the State recall it and bring it back to the system, thereby penalising the person concerned?  It is an absolute disgrace but I will say more about it at a different time.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a delay with this legislation, which has been unacceptable.  Better late than never.  I hope sincerely that it will proceed with full speed through the different Stages of the House and will ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be alert to the fact that somebody, somewhere, cares about this, and that the Houses of the Oireachtas cares, as should be the case.  It should tilt the situation in favour of those who are trying to enforce the law.<\/p>  <p>  I refer again to the drugs problem, which everybody knows is getting worse because there is an adequate supply of drugs.  If the supply was not there, we would not see such a problem.  There are those who say we must have methadone, and I agree with such treatment.  The purpose of it, however, is to wean the potential drug addict away from drugs and reduce dependency gradually.  I am afraid it does not work in all cases and we are spending money trying to do something that cannot be done.  It merely perpetuates the hunger for a particular drug.  There are those who say there are some minor drugs and who believe that everybody should have the right to use them for personal use.  Every one of them, however, is a gateway drug.  All the experts will eventually tell us that, when challenged.  Nevertheless, we might continue trying to convince ourselves that it is not true and they are good for people because they relieve anxiety.  They will but they will give one hell of a headache further down the road.  That is a fact.  Medical experts tell us unequivocally that gateway drugs have hallucinogenic effects and side-effects, with a person's health in danger at a later stage.  We must take account of that advice and, as a result, we must make the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na easier.  In our legislation, we must indicate clearly that helping out drug barons is not part of our agenda.  We are helping them out if we are ensuring there is a ready supply of drugs on the street and it should not be that way.  There is no compelling reason for that.  Trying to countenance something like that at any level is wrong and would be detrimental to our society.<\/p>  <p>  We must come down on one side or the other and we are either for or against it.  There are those who maintain we should continue as we are, half-heartedly, like Lanna Machree's dog, going a bit of the way with one and a bit with the other, going nowhere in particular.  We must be clear about this.  In order to be fair to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we must interrupt the supply of drugs in a meaningful way.  In this regard, I compliment the activities of the past couple of months, when international police forces and governments have come together and made a fair attempt in a short space of time at cutting off supply and preventing growth or expansion in drug barons' industry.<\/p> <p>To those who say we will never succeed and that it is not a possibility in any event, this is simply not true.  It is necessary to do the work that has to be done as quickly as possible to ensure we prevent, as well as accost in whatever way possible, whenever possible and at every opportunity.<\/p> <p> This is important legislation.  I hope it will deal adequately with the issue involved, which is the ongoing disquiet among members of the Garda at the delay involved in introducing the legislation.  This disquiet is obvious.  If something has been going on for ten, 15 or 20 years and it is still on the agenda but not operable there is something wrong.  We should not allow ourselves to be lulled into this type of situation.  The reason I believe we have been lulled into it is that concentration was elsewhere.  We have done everything else.  We now have to deal with the issues of the police force and the job it has to do in very difficult and life-threatening circumstances on a regular basis.  I pay tribute to those members of the force who paid the ultimate price of their lives in carrying out their ordinary work.<\/p> <p> Any family with a member in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will appreciate the fact that everyone, whether they are parents, sons, daughters or whatever they may be, has a private life.  They have a rightful expectation to be properly protected and, in the event of protection not being enough, compensated.  I do not want to detain the House any longer than necessary other than to say that I welcome the legislation.  I hope it goes through the House as quickly as possible.  I compliment the Minister and the Department for bringing it forward.  I hope it will be part and parcel of what appears to be international awareness of the necessity to tackle the various issues I have referred to, particularly the drugs issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900041#SS00300","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652970600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Durkan, for an interesting speech on the Bill and many other aspects of law and order throughout the country.  On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, I thank everyone for their broad support for this important Bill and for their contributions over recent days.  As the Minister mentioned in her opening remarks on Tuesday, the current Garda compensation scheme has been in operation since the 1940s.  It is important that we update the processes and key actors to make it more efficient and effective by utilising systems that are already in place for personal injuries actions more generally.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides a new and more streamlined system for Garda compensation claims, which will reduce the time it takes to get from injury to initial application to award, while also reducing the costs of administering the scheme.  It is important to note that the Bill maintains the parameters of the right to compensation under the old legislation.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan questioned whether the intention of the Bill is to reduce awards but I assure the Deputy this is not the case.  Instead, it makes a number of key process changes, with clear timeframes for each stage to ensure a swift resolution of claims to reduce the administrative costs of the scheme and not the awards.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides more time for applicants to make an application, extending the time period from three months for initial application to six months and this can be extended where necessary.  Significantly, it provides members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with quicker avenues for resolution of their claims in the event of an injury arising out of a malicious incident and it allows for independent review at various stages of the process where the determination made is a refusal.  This means that applicants will no longer have to take judicial review proceedings, which are expensive and time consuming.<\/p>  <p>  The use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, for assessing the award of Garda compensation ensures an independent assessment for members who need to avail of the scheme as a result of suffering an injury arising out of a malicious incident.  The PIAB is expert at what it does and it will lead to greater consistency in awards as the PIAB will be guided by the personal injuries guidelines in its assessments.  This was acknowledged by a number of Deputies in their contributions on the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that the Bill will allow for the majority of cases to be resolved without the need for court proceedings.  This will reduce the legal costs associated with these claims over time.  The option to proceed to a lower court rather than the necessity to bring each claim before the High Court will mean a lower level of costs associated with some of the claims that do proceed to court.  We can all agree that this an important change as there are cases at present where the legal costs are much greater than the awards themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Turning now to the debate, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has asked me to respond to some of the queries raised by Deputies.  Deputy Daly questioned whether the time limit of 30 days for the Garda Commissioner to submit an application to the PIAB was sufficient.  As the application form to the Commissioner will contain all the information needed for an application to the PIAB, it will be a simple administrative step to submit this and 30 days is sufficient in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Some Deputies questioned whether the PIAB would create delays rather than reduce them.  This is not the case.  As we all know, the PIAB is a very efficient outfit.  For example, the average time for processing claims over the five-year period between 2016 and 2020 was 7.7 months.  This will be a significant improvement on current waiting times before the High Court.  It is also hoped that the introduction of the new personal injuries guidelines and the requirement for the PIAB and the courts to have regard to them in assessing injury claims will bring greater consistency to award levels across the personal injury environment, which will, hopefully, increase the acceptance of PIAB awards.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to insurance premiums, the Government is committed to reforming the insurance sector but cannot set the price of insurance.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, have met the CEOs of the main firms to discuss the Government's expectation that insurers will commence reflecting the savings arising from lower injury awards to consumers and businesses, in line with previous commitments from the industry.  These engagements were positive, with insurers indicating that consistent implementation of the guidelines should result in lower premiums.<\/p>  <p>Deputies O'Reilly and O'Donoghue noted that malicious incidents can occur due to a lack of resources.  I would like to point out that Government investment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reached unprecedented levels, with budget 2022 providing for &euro;2.062 billion.  The significant level of funding provided over recent years is enabling sustained ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  The Government is on track to meet its commitment of 15,000 sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 4,000 staff.  Budget 2022 includes funding for the recruitment of up to an additional 800 garda&iacute; next year and the recruitment of up to an additional 400 Garda staff.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of insurance reform more generally.  As the Deputy is aware, on 1 March 2022 the Government published the second implementation report on the action plan for insurance reform.  The report shows that implementation of the plan is on track, with approximately 80% of actions now being delivered with the remaining initiated.<\/p> <p>Principal actions delivered to date include the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market and the Insurance Fraud Coordination Office.  Legislation to strengthen the laws on perjury has been enacted and we have seen a milestone reform with the commencement of the personal injuries guidelines.<\/p> <p> Good progress is being made under our action plan.  Central Statistics Office data shows that the average cost of claims for motor insurance policies is down 20%, while data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, shows that average award levels have decreased by approximately 42%.  However, there is more to do and, in 2022, the focus is on remaining actions, including legislative reform in the areas of occupier's liability, completing the reform of the PIAB and competition enforcement.<\/p> <p> Deputies Howlin, Catherine Murphy and Martin Browne asked about psychological injuries.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, assures the Deputies that, yes, claims may be made for psychological as well as physical injuries under the Bill.  The personal injury guidelines, which came into effect in April 2021, provide detail on the level of awards relevant to injuries of a psychological nature.<\/p> <p> Deputy Howlin also queried whether Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, officers may make claims under the Bill.  Bureau officers, as well as Chief State Solicitor's office staff working on CAB matters are covered, as are reserves, trainees and former members.<\/p> <p> Deputy Berry asked about the compensation scheme in place for prison officers and whether the Bill would apply to them.  I point out that this scheme has been designed and developed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, while there may well be merit in extending it or having a similar scheme for other roles, the implications and operation of any such scheme would have to be thought through carefully.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Durkan mentioned, this scheme is a long time in development and we need to get on with it and put it in place for garda&iacute; and their family members as soon as possible.  The Minister will of course keep the operation of this scheme, and other schemes of this nature, under review in the future.<\/p> <p> On the extension of the scheme to civilian members, which was raised by many Deputies, I understand from the Minister that this issue is being examined by her Department.  Consultations have indicated that there are complexities with the extension arising from the fact that civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are civil servants and the interaction with the existing civil servant occupational schemes that already apply to them is not straightforward.  The Minister is trying to work through these issues and has indicated that she does not wish to delay the passage of the Bill.  The urgent need for reform in this area has been acknowledged by many Deputies so I think we can agree that this Bill should be progressed to enactment as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> Once again, on behalf of the Minister, I thank the Deputies for their contributions on this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900042#TT00200","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652971200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Compensation) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1652971200,"counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900043#UU00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1652971200,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(a) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900043#UU00400","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652971200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1652971200,"counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900043#UU00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","time":1652971200,"counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900043#UU00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1652971200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I raise the serious issue of medical scientists and their trade union, the Medical Laboratory Scientist Association's 21-year campaign to implement their pay parity claim, which was approved by the then Minister for Health in 2001.  With no resolution in sight, the workers were forced to take strike action yesterday.  I wish to put it on the record that in 61 years, the medical scientists have only ever had one other strike, which was in 1969.  They are not a mad, radical group of workers dying to get out on to the streets.  This was a last resort for them to make their point about what has been going on.<\/p>  <p>  As a brief background, the Medical Laboratory Scientist Association's claim for parity with clinical biochemist colleagues dates to 2001, when an expert group report recommended pay parity between the grades.  The then Minister for Health, who is now the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, signed off on that and the Department of Health accepted the findings at the time.  The newly awarded pay parity was lost within months as a result of an inadvertent procedural error in the first public service benchmarking award in June 2002.  Following the job evaluation process for laboratory aids in 2019, the starting salary for a laboratory aid, who requires a leaving certificate, became higher than the starting salary for a State registered medical scientist with a level 8 degree.  In January 2020, against a backdrop of a severe and growing recruitment and retention crisis among medical scientists, the MLSA renewed its long-standing claim for parity of pay and career progression with clinical biochemists and sought engagement with the HSE and the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  By way of a timeline of the negotiations, a meeting with the HSE in March 2020 was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic with talks eventually beginning in August 2020.  These talks stalled on the commencement of negotiations on the public service pay deal, Building Momentum, in October 2020.  In February 2021, the MLSA rejected the terms of Building Momentum, taking the view that they did not deal with the key employment issues in the sector.  Further discussion on the career progression side of the claim commenced with the HSE and the Department of Health under the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in early 2021, but the employer side withdrew in April 2021, without reaching agreement.  In November 2021, with no progress made on the parity claim, and in the context of an even more extreme recruitment and retention crisis, MLSA members voted 98% in favour of industrial action in pursuit of their claim.<\/p>  <p>  Despite rejecting Building Momentum, the union has participated fully in sectoral bargaining talks on the Building Momentum public sector pay deal.  However, following meaningful proposals from the MLSA, no satisfactory progress has been made or currently appears possible.  Following several requests by the MLSA, the WRC conciliation on career progression recommenced in March 2022 but, again, the HSE and the Department of Health failed to commit to an agreement on the issue.  I met a number of medical scientists in the audiovisual room on Tuesday after they came back from the WRC.  They were asked to go back and they did so.  Again, no agreement was put forward by the Department of Health or HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the Minister is not present and I know the Minister of State will give the reply he has been supplied with, but there is a real need for the Government to get the finger out and actually deal with the issues these workers are facing.  It is a parity claim that the Department of Health has signed off on, and it should be dealt with immediately before the two-day strike next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900043#UU00800","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1652971200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  On behalf of the Minister, I acknowledge and pay tribute to the dedication, professionalism and commitment of all medical scientists throughout the country.  Medical scientists play a valued and vital role within our health service.  Their drive and dedication have been key components in our management of the Covid-19 pandemic.  During the pandemic, they were at the front line of the response, providing a crucial role in testing and this has not gone unnoticed.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the ongoing and long-standing claim for pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists.  Health management has been engaging with the Medical Laboratory Scientist Association on these issues at the Workplace Relations Commission under the terms of the current public service agreement, Building Momentum.  As the MLSA is part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, it is bound by the terms of the agreement for the remainder of its lifetime.<\/p> <p> Building Momentum includes the process of sectoral bargaining to deal with all outstanding claims across the public sector.  The bargaining fund equates to 1% of basic pensionable pay for each bargaining unit set up under the agreement.  Under Building Momentum, sectoral bargaining is the sole mechanism through which the MLSA can advance its claim. The MLSA requested that it be facilitated with its own bargaining unit in the sectoral bargaining process in order to progress its claim for pay parity. As such, the MLSA has at its disposal a fund equivalent to 1% of basic pay of all medical scientists.  While this fund is insufficient to fully resolve its long-standing claims, it can partially resolve the claim and the remainder could be addressed in a future public service agreement, as per the terms of Building Momentum.  As I have stated previously, the MLSA and health management have been engaged in talks over the last number of months with the aim of finding a way to advance the claim through this sectoral bargaining process.  Several options were explored during these talks, but to date, none has satisfactorily resolved the claim in full, within the terms set out under Building Momentum.<\/p> <p> The public service agreement group, comprising union and Civil Service representatives and an independent chair, met on 11 May to consider the MLSA's claim for pay parity.  It recommended that the matter be immediately referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and that industrial peace be maintained in the meantime.  Health management met with the MLSA under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission on 17 May but, unfortunately, no resolution was reached.  While the MLSA agreed to engage at the Workplace Relations Commission, it did not lift its industrial action, which is a breach of Building Momentum.  It is disappointing that the strike went ahead yesterday, despite it being precluded under the agreement.  I recognise the significant disruption caused by yesterday's strike and the impact it has had on the health service.  The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Department of Health and the HSE remain open to engagement with the MLSA, noting that we are compelled to resolve any disputes in compliance with the provisions allowed for under Building Momentum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900043#UU00900","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652971800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I was hoping for a more positive response from the Minister of State.  Building Momentum only provides for a fund of 1%, which means that the pay increase will be &euro;1.45 million for the 1,800 medical scientists.  That is 7% lower than the 8% committed to back in 2001 in respect of pay parity.  Surely, there must be some way that the Department can think outside the box to deal with a legacy pay parity claim dating back 21 years.  It is hugely unfair to force these workers to remain under the restrictions of the Building Momentum agreement.  They have gone out of their way.  Under the Croke Park Agreement, they saved the State &euro;10 million.  They have been working flat out.  They are working well beyond their contracted 38-hour week and are filling vacancies at weekends.  On the issue of the retention of medical scientists in labs, they are losing workers every day and are being forced to fill gaps.  For patient safety in the long run, and as part of public health policy, the Government should be thinking outside the box.  The only Department that does not seem to have attended these talks is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The latter controls the purse strings of the Department of Health.  If the Government is serious, it should think outside the box and immediately implement the 8% pay parity.  The Minister of State that he is disappointed that the MLSA has initiated strike action.

The centre operated very successfully up until April 2020.  There was an issue around the building that the centre was operating out of, and it was closed down.  I understand that there was an assumption or some reassurance given that another premises would be sourced for the service.  It is a vital service.  As the Minister of State is aware, Wicklow town is a big, thriving town with a big population.  These services are very much in demand.  I have engaged with the Minister for Social Protection and her Department on the matter.  I received a response in March which stated that the Citizens Information Board had informed the Minister that new premises had been located in Wicklow town, that planning for the change of use of those premises had been granted and that the Department of Social Protection and the Citizens Information Board were in discussions in respect of funding required to complete the new premises and reopen the much-needed office.  Everybody was quite satisfied and happy with that response.<\/p>  <p>  On 13 May, just two months after I received the first response, the regional manager in Wicklow citizens information service was informed by the Citizens Information Board that the Wicklow Town Citizens Information Centre will not be funded by the Department of Social Protection.  It gets more complex.  I hope the Minister of State is following this.  I then raised the issue with the Minister for Social Protection.  I was told that the Citizens Information Board is independent and decides on issues of funding and what services it is going to provide.  According to a note from the Citizens Information Board, funding will not be provided by the Department of Social Protection.  I want to try to get the bottom of the matter.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the service is required in Wicklow.  Many people are extremely disappointed at the kind of messing around that has gone on.  There are information services operating in Arklow and Bray quite successfully.  However, the public transport links from Wicklow town to Arklow are not great.  There are slightly better transport links to Bray.  There are two vital services being provided at either extremity of the county.  It is in Wicklow town that we need an information service.  I want to know who decides to provide the budget for the information centre.  Is it the Citizens Information Board, which, the Minister informs me, is independent or is it the Department of Social Protection, which the Citizens Information Board has informed the information centre is not providing the funding?  I want to get to the bottom of it.  How is the funding decided?  Who carries out the assessment to determine that the information centre is required and should be funded?<\/p> <p>I understand that is up to the Citizens Information Board, CIB.  I want to know how, in a two-month period, it came to that assessment and decided that it was not going to reopen.  Hopefully, the Minister of State is going to tell me that the money is there and that it will reopen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900044#VV01100","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652972400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Matthews for raising this matter and I also thank him for outlining how important the Citizens Information Board is.  I know myself when I was starting out in politics how very useful and necessary its advice was in my own local town.  The Citizens Information Board is the statutory body with responsibility for the Citizens Information Service, CIS.  The CIB provides funding to eight CIS companies that operate a national network of Citizens Information Centres, CICs.<\/p>  <p>  Each CIS is a limited company overseen by a board of directors and makes decisions independently on the delivery of services in their regions.  Decisions regarding the delivery of services in Wicklow town are therefore a matter for the board of the south Leinster CIS.  In March 2020, the board of south Leinster CIS made the decision to close the Wicklow CIC office as part of its Covid-19 response.  Decisions such as these are entirely a matter for the south Leinster CIS board.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2021, I understand that south Leinster CIS made the decision to discontinue services in their Wicklow town office due to health and safety concerns as outlined by the Deputy.  The board had undertaken an internal assessment of the premises and identified that they were unsuitable.  I understand that the south Leinster board looked to put alternative arrangements in place.  A temporary office location was identified in Wicklow town but the board made the decision not to use this office as it looked to procure a longer-term arrangement.  An office space in the centre of Wicklow town was considered.  However, the premises required substantial financial investment before it could be utilised.  Planning permission for the change of use of these premises was granted to the landlord in late 2021 and consequently the costs had not been factored into CIB's 2022 budget allocation estimates process.<\/p>  <p>  CIB provides funding to the various regional CIS companies and funding may be available for projects that are necessary for the effective delivery of service.

Ultimately, the funding must come from that Department down to the board and it then decides.  Has the funding been withheld by the Department or is the funding there and the south Leinster CIS board has decided to spend it elsewhere?  If that is the case, I will be satisfied that the senior Minister has provided the funding and I will go then and chase the board to see why it is not providing that service to Wicklow town, considering that the board was all for it in finding premises and in recognising that that service was required.<\/p>  <p>  We are doing considerable work in Wicklow town.

T&aacute; Gaeilge beo agus ag f&aacute;s inti agus an-&eacute;ileamh uirthi freisin.  Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in on B&oacute;thar Ghlas Na&iacute;on Road, Finglas East, is a co-educational all-Irish school registered under An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta i gcomhair na scoileanna l&aacute;nGhaeilge.<\/p>  <p>  It is a primary school for pupils aged four to 12 years.  It opened on 1 September 2005 using two changing rooms at the back of the West Finglas Tenants Residents Association, WFTRA Hall in Finglas west.  In 2008 the school moved to the former De La Salle school building in Finglas east. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in is to support learning and development by providing the highest standards of education through the medium of Irish.  As a Gaelscoil, Gaeilge has a central place in the life of the school.  Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in is recognised as a school in a disadvantaged area of Dublin and has DEIS band 1 status.<\/p>  <p>  The school has faced major challenges from the day it moved into its present building because of its condition.  The windows were either yellowed Perspex or else they were boarded up.  Mould, which is especially detrimental to the health of young children, was evident throughout the building.<\/p>  <p>  The school received &euro;20,000 in 2009 to rid the classrooms, corridors and toilets of mould.  In 2010 the school received a grant to upgrade the heating system through a summer works scheme.  However, it was refused an application for a grant to upgrade the windows.<\/p>  <p>  There is evidence of woodworm in the school hall and in the attic.  The yard surface is uneven and the tarmac is old and is a cause of concern as it is where young children play during break times.  Children need proper facilities where they can exercise and play.<\/p>  <p>  The classrooms do not have toilets in or even near them and this is very inconvenient for both teachers and the young children.  A trip to the toilet for a young child has become more complicated than should be necessary and does result in the loss of teaching time.<\/p> <p>The two-storey building has no lift, which makes it difficult for the school to accommodate children or anybody else who uses a wheelchair.  It also means that all furniture, equipment, boxes for hot lunches etc. have to be carried up the stairs, which raises health and safety concerns.  The Department of Education eventually bought the building in 2019, having paid more than &euro;1 million in rent for 11 years.  The school has received some grants for building improvements over the years, but this has been done in a very piecemeal fashion and is akin to putting a sticking plaster over a broken leg.<\/p> <p> Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in is one of Finglas's success stories.  It is well integrated into the community, providing employment, cultural outreach and awareness of the Irish language.  It has been to the fore in assisting the families of pupils and the community during the pandemic by providing food parcels and other supports for parents and disadvantaged members of the community.  The school needs a proper investment for its 300-plus pupils and 30 staff.  Despite visits by departmental officials in 2019 and 2020, management is none the wiser as to the long term future of the school.  It has been on a waiting list for works since at least 2010 and, according to the most current information, it is still at pre-stage 1.  Huge sums of money are spent each year heating the school.  Having run out of room, two prefabricated buildings were installed in 2019.  A third will have to be installed to accommodate an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit, for which the school is in the process of making an application.<\/p> <p> In ainneoin gach rud, t&aacute; an scoil ag d&eacute;anamh jab an-mhaith ar fad agus t&aacute;im an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il as an m&eacute;id at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900045#WW00600","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652973000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta as an gceist agus as an deis chun freagra a thabhairt d&oacute; &oacute; thaobh na scoile seo.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the D&aacute;il the current position in regard to the major building project for Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in in Finglas East, Dublin 11.  The project is included in my Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan, NDP, as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion in capital investment over the period from 2021 to 2025.  This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty with our ambitious plans to deliver high-quality building projects, with a real and particular focus on sustainability, for school communities throughout Ireland.  The investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  It will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help to transition the school system to an era of net-zero carbon by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the brief for the Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in project provides for the development of a 16-classroom school, with an additional two classrooms for pupils with special educational needs, including the refurbishment of the existing school buildings, minor demolitions, construction of a new school extension and all associated works on the school's existing site at Glasanaon Road.  The major building project for Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in will be delivered under the Department's accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering, ADAPT, programme.  Under the programme, a professional external project manager co-ordinates and drives the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the delivery of projects through the stages of architectural planning, tender and on to construction.<\/p>  <p>  The tender process to appoint a project manager has just been completed.  The first step to be undertaken by the project manager will be the tender competitions for the appointment of design teams for a number of school building projects.  This will include the appointment of the design team to progress the project for Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in.  The Department will shortly advise the school authorities of further developments in regard to these appointments.  Upon appointment, the design team will proceed to stage 1 of architectural planning, that is, preliminary design, whereby the team will assess the site and current school buildings and prepare their initial sketch schemes.  The scope and extent of works to be carried out will be established during this early stage.  My Department is currently engaging with the school's patron to explore the potential for providing interim accommodation on the school site to facilitate the establishment of a special class for the 2022-23 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate all the points the Deputy has made, which are to his credit.  I want to be clear that this project is now moving in a positive direction in terms of the appointment of a project manager and the other steps that will follow in suit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900046#XX00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1652973000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och den Aire as an bhfreagra sin, ach t&aacute; rud &eacute;igin ann nach bhfuil soil&eacute;ir domsa.

The appointment of a project manager is a great move forward but I am worried about the timescale for organising the design team and moving on from there.  I would not like to see this drag on.  I was involved in the founding of Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in in the WFTRA Hall, along with Se&aacute;n &Oacute;g, who was involved in Gaelscoil Naomh Foinnbarra.  At the time, there was no Irish language school in Finglas, despite its large population.  It was an absolute shambles and a shame.  Since then, however, Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in has gone from strength to strength and there is a huge demand for places.  As I said, there are prefabricated buildings in place and we are seeking an ASD unit, but these are interim measures.  We want to see the proper buildings being constructed.  I hope the project will be prioritised, as the Minister said, and will move quickly.  The Gaelscoil is one of the great successes for the Irish language and for people in Finglas and the areas it serves.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot say enough about the people who have been involved in the school.  There has been massive input by the local community, volunteers and others to get this project off the ground to where we are now.  People talk about the Gaeltacht and other areas.  Ballymun is located beside us in Finglas and there is lots of Irish spoken there.  Ballymun has three Gaelscoileanna and we have one now in Finglas.  I really hope this project moves quickly.

I absolutely understand all the Deputy has outlined and I appreciate the enormous tribute that is richly deserved by the community, which has worked so hard to advance the school and promote it.  Indeed, credit is due also to the community for the manner in which it has embraced the school and ensured it has thrived, as the Deputy outlined.  I appreciate how important it is to everybody involved in the school that the project be advanced as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for his graciousness in acknowledging the positive step forward that is the completion of the tender process for the appointment of a project manager.  The project is part of the ADAPT programme, as I indicated.  The next step is the appointment of the design team, which will incorporate a consultant architect, civil structural engineer, building services engineer, quantity surveyor and others.  Once it begins, that process will take approximately 12 weeks.  The design team will then begin stage 1 of the architectural planning, which will encompass the site investigation, including the condition of the existing school buildings, which is an important consideration, site suitability, the initial sketch scheme and all of that.  The next steps will be submission of a pre-stage 1 report to the Department for review and sign-off to develop an agreed design option, followed by the submission of a summary stage 1 report to the Department, based on the agreed preferred design option, for review and approval.<\/p>  <p>  I am absolutely determined that this process will move as quickly as possible for all of the reasons the Deputy rightly outlined.

I was extraordinarily honoured to welcome the Minister to the Cork East constituency.  I wish to convey my gratitude and thanks to her and to her officials and advisers who travelled to the constituency for a very successful visit.  We had an engagement with secondary school principals on issues around inbound children who are coming from the conflict in Ukraine and staying in Ireland.  Those issues are quite serious for schools and they have to deal with new challenges.  This is a matter of great concern to many principals throughout the country, especially in the case of Youghal in east Cork, a concern that was highlighted to all those from the Department who attended the meeting.<\/p>  <p>  What has taken place in Ukraine is an extraordinarily tragic event in its history and it is absolutely harrowing to hear the stories from many people who have come to my constituency office to explain the circumstances.  They have had to flee their homes.  They have left loved ones behind and do not know how they are in terms of whether they are being affected by conflict on a day-to-day basis.  It is extremely traumatic for the children involved.  I compliment the work done by the Department of Education and by school principals, school communities, boards of management and school staff in dealing with this extraordinary and unprecedented event that nobody expected to happen, following on from very difficult years of Covid.  The Minister has acknowledged this and I thank her for doing so.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the secondary school capacity in Youghal, they have been doing very good work there to try to host the new students who have arrived.  They are expecting approximately 70 into one school, which is very much an outlier on a national basis.  What is interesting from looking around country, and in terms of the feedback we are getting from some of the research we have done throughout the constituency and further afield and from talking to those in education, is that schools are very much seeking additional supports when it comes to special educational needs, SEN.<\/p>  <p>  What is absolutely crucial to communicate to the Department of Education and the Minister is the requirement for a degree of certainty around planning for the new academic year.  Decisions could be made swiftly about what additional supports will be coming down the line.  It is very difficult to make decisions when one is a Minister in a Department that has gone through extraordinary challenges with Covid-19 and now with this conflict.  These decisions take considerable time, preparation and work.  I acknowledge the work that has been done.  However, it is important for the new academic year that decisions be made, especially in the run-up to the D&aacute;il recess, to give schools a little bit of certainty around planning for the employment of staff in the coming year and the additional SEN supports that are required.<\/p>  <p>  The documentation for children with additional and special needs who are coming to Ireland from Ukraine has been highlighted to me.  Some of that documentation is not being recognised here when it comes to the supports that are required.  We have to be very conscious of that as well.<\/p>  <p>  In the wider context, the Department has had to deal with a new situation extremely rapidly and it has been very challenging.  However, it is important to make these points and I thank the Minister for being in the Chamber to hear them.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to the provision of additional capacity and space, it is important that the temporary units be made available.  These have been very successful in some schools where they have been put in.  They have gotten considerable positive feedback.  We need to see a degree of speed and see processes being expedited to provide the additional temporary units for the new academic year.<\/p>  <p>  The whole situation is extraordinarily traumatic and very saddening.  Some areas of the country taking in larger numbers than others need a little bit of further assistance and help.

It gives me an opportunity to present the most up-to-date information to the House.  I will say to the House, as I did to the Deputy personally, that it was an excellent visit to east Cork.  I very much appreciated the opportunity to meet the schools and school communities on the ground and have very positive engagements.  We are very appreciative of that.  I acknowledge that many of the points raised with me on the day with regard to issues did not pertain to my Department.  There was an absolute acknowledgement, in terms of the resources for English as an additional language, EAL, or additional hours required by schools to meet the demands of having additional students from Ukraine, having already been met by my Department.  I gave a commitment on the day that will continue going forward.<\/p><p>As Minister for Education in the Department of Education, I acknowledge that our schools throughout the country have done great work in welcoming Ukrainian children and young people into their communities.  I have witnessed this excellent work first hand when I have visited many schools, including in the Deputy's constituency.  The Department of Education published figures on Monday which show that almost 6,000 students from Ukraine have enrolled in primary and post-primary schools.  The Department has allocated additional resources as required for these enrolments, including teaching hours for EAL.  All schools who enrol Ukrainian students are eligible for additional EAL support.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate the scale of the response needed when more than 30,000 Ukrainians have arrived to date.  This was why the Department moved quickly in the early phase of the Ukrainian crisis to establish regional education and language teams, REALTs, throughout the country to co-ordinate school enrolments for Ukrainian families.  They have been a key element of the Department's supports for all schools, establishing relationships with each community response forum and with the Tusla education support service, TESS.  Other agencies are also linked into these teams, including the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the inspectorate.<\/p><p>All school management bodies have nominated representatives to liaise with each REALT.  The primary role of REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus is on assisting families in securing school places, when they are ready to engage with the school system.  It is important that it is when they are ready to engage.  REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support the Department in developing new capacity where required and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area.  The Deputy will recall that there was a very positive endorsement of the work of REALT in our engagement with school management.<\/p><p>These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures.  The Department is committed to providing every support possible to all those fleeing war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland.  These teams will provide critical support in aligning current school capacity with the placement of Ukrainian families as much as possible.<\/p><p>The Department's data show that there is generally good capacity across the country, albeit there may be capacity pressures to be managed in some areas.  Many resources for teaching, learning and inclusion of Ukrainian pupils have been published to date, including a central repository of information and continuing professional development, CPD, resources for school leaders and teachers to support cultural and linguistic diversity, which is available on <i>scoilnet.ie<\/i>.  A helpline for school principals is also in place.  NEPS has delivered a series of well-being webinars via Education Support Centres Ireland to further support schools.  It will develop further advice and resources as needs emerge and its psychologists are actively engaging with school principals to provide advice and support in this initial stage of welcoming children and young people.<\/p><p>Schools that have enrolled students from Ukraine can apply for additional English language support and hundreds of schools are already receiving this support.  Included among the wide array of resources available to schools is information on free digital tools, including apps that can assist with text and voice translation.  These resources are particularly useful in terms of making forms and documents accessible to all and for assisting with communication between schools and parents.  Further information is available on the website of the Professional Development Service for Teachers.  Further information on the Department of Education's approach to supporting children and young people from Ukraine is available on the Department's website and is updated regularly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900047#YY00300","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1652973600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the contribution that has been made.  I certainly will go through it and feed that back to the schools with which we are engaging and are in discussions.  I appreciate the time and effort the Minister is putting in into this.  It cannot be understated how much of a challenge this is for the Civil Service.  We face considerable criticism but this a very unique and new challenge we have to deal with.  I emphasise the need for urgent and rapid progress to be made on planning for the new academic year to give the schools that degree of certainty about what new departmental measures will be taken and to perhaps look at what is happening at present and try to refine and improve on it for the new academic year.  It is very important and will give schools certainty about what they will need to do around staffing provision and additional accommodation.  Getting those processes under way is a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to hear the Minister reference REALT.  The decisions around placement and enrolment of children have been brought to my attention.<\/p> <p>Some schools tell me that it is difficult since REALT is in communication with them, but the placement of children is left up to schools and individual communities.  They would prefer more fine-tuned engagement in that area to some extent.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could take that up.<\/p> <p> One other matter of great importance is the provision of home school liaison, which is funded through DEIS.  It would be nice to see this looked at, especially in Youghal.  I know there has been much engagement on that topic.  I hope the Government might consider providing further funding over the next months for what was a very successful further enhancement of the DEIS scheme.  I commend the Minister on the work she did.  We would love to see that being implemented in Youghal.  That is important to me.<\/p> <p> The issue of translation is arising.  We need to see translators recruited, hopefully permanently, to work directly with schools and children, and also to have counselling services for children who have gone through extraordinary trauma because of what has happened in Ukraine.  That process of moving to a new country, to surroundings they are not familiar with, and obviously what happened prior to their departure is all deeply concerning and has been raised with me.  Perhaps the Department of Education could work with other Departments to look at that and raise those points.

That welcome is extended across society.  The Department's primary concern is to ensure children and young people of schoolgoing age from Ukraine are provided with appropriate educational opportunities.  I acknowledge, as I did at the outset, the tremendous work that our students, school leaders and staff are doing and continue to do in welcoming Ukrainian children and young people into our schools over the past three months.  I acknowledge the professionalism and care and welcome that they give to Ukrainian families every day.  Specifically, as I have outlined, a suite of resources is being made available to schools and being drawn down by them.  I have seen that first-hand, whether that includes English as an additional language or additional teaching hours and additional teaching posts as required, depending on the numbers that arrive to our schools.  That has been acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  We are currently seeking to roll out the English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, project, which is where we are putting in place additional language tutors for those who do not have English as a first language.  That resource will be available to post-primary students and adults.  A community and family approach is being taken to accessing language.  Regarding planning for the new school year, all the requirements that schools currently have for additional staffing and resources are being provided for.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is a fluid situation.  Families continue to arrive at different times and they will continue to arrive over the summer.  Whatever resources are required in September will also be put in place.  The Deputy referred to counselling and NEPS facilities.  NEPS psychologists are on the ground working with schools.  All resources required to ensure that children and young people are adequately, suitably and appropriately catered for in schools are being put in place.  That supplements the excellent work taking place in school communities.<\/p>  <p>  I have visited many counties and there has been positive feedback on REALT.  Schools are not required to take students if they do not have capacity.  It is REALT's function to find appropriate accommodation in appropriate schools where there is capacity or to make alternative arrangements.  As I said earlier, we know that we have great capacity in some areas and less in others.  We are working closely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure that, if at all possible, accommodation matches capacity in our schools.

The Minister knows this issue well.  I introduced this Bill in November 2020.  The Minister did not oppose the amendments to the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 contained in it and asked that Second Stage be taken after 12 months to facilitate her Department doing the requisite evaluation of the impact of what my amendment intended to do.  We had deliberations at the joint committee and witnesses appeared from the equality and education spheres who felt that there was no need for the amendment.  There was one dissenting voice on the basis that the provision for providing potentially 25% of places to the children or grandchildren of past pupils is rarely used and, therefore, there is no need to omit it from the Act.  The question from me and others at the committee was: why does the provision exist if it is never used?<\/p><p>The Minister knows how strongly my party, the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I feel about this part of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act.  I cannot speak to the genesis, motivations or lobbying behind it, but I know that it was sought by a particular sector of the education field to facilitate certain schools that wanted to keep the royal bloodline succession in their schools by allowing 25% of places to be held over for the children or grandchildren of past pupils.  Of course it is discriminatory.  A person's parents or grandparents may not have gone to secondary school.  It disproportionately affects members of the Traveller community and people who are not from the immediate area and whose parents or grandparents went to primary or secondary school in another area of the country.  People who are living in County Kerry who are not originally from Kerry would be affected by this.  People who are not from the country would be affected.  I was doing research on my own family and it turned out that none of my grandparents went to secondary school, so it would appear that I would have been at a disadvantage if this legislation had been in vogue when I was trying to access second level places back in the day.<\/p><p>There is agreement from the Minister and parties across the House that this element of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act is unnecessary, elitist, divisive, and is causing problems.  It is not just being utilised by the fee-paying sector, although I suspect it really wanted it.  It is used across the board in the non-fee-paying sector too.  In certain areas where there is oversubscription and families are trying to access a school place, they find themselves at a disadvantage if they are not from that area, because they did not attend the school themselves.<\/p><p>I know the Minister believes that education is the great liberator.  It is the one thing that will lift people out of difficult situations and put them onto a new path.  The one thing that can bring people through poverty and lift them more than anything else is the beauty and availability of education.  I have seen through my life the effect it has had on families and individuals.  All barriers that are placed between an individual and access to education need to be rooted out.  To place a barrier by allowing more access rights in any situation to somebody whose grandfather or grandmother went to a particular school does violence to the idea of a republic.<\/p> <p>I think people forget what a republic actually means.  It is not the absence of a monarchy.  It means that absolutely every single citizen of this State has the same rights and the same opportunities, no matter who their parents or their grandparents were.  This amendment of the Act does violence and injustice to that philosophy.  <\/p> <p> I want to ask the Minister a number of questions.  It has been suggested to me that the entirety of the Act should possibly have been directed to the Data Protection Commissioner because it potentially comes under section 36 of the GDPR Act.  The Minister might speak to that again at a later point or forward me her Department's opinion on it.  The main thing I want to get from today's session is how we can move this to becoming law.  It sometimes frustrates Opposition Deputies and I dare say Government backbenchers when they have a piece of legislation they have drafted and crafted in good faith and there is agreement around it, when it comes from a place of decency and equality and they really want to see it get over the line and become law rather than flounder through red tape or whatever.  I believe what we are trying to do here is ethical, right and just.  We went through the proper process, put it forward for selection in the lottery for Private Member's Bills.  It was taken up and debated.  The Minister asked that it be delayed for 12 months and it was.  It is on Second Stage now.  Can the Minister, the Government or those who have influence over these things allow some time to be given in these Houses for this to become law?  If it were to happen, it would be a good reflection of what we can achieve together for children in the education system in this place we call a republic.  It should not matter who their parents or their grandparents were.<\/p> <p> Imagine this scenario.  A Ukrainian child arrives in this country seeking refuge and then has difficulty accessing a second level place because the person whose father or grandfather went to the school has more of a right than that child has.  That would be a preposterous scenario but it is what we have in law.  I ask the Minister again, if we are all agreed on this, how can we make it happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900048#ZZ00400","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652974800,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging and thanking the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for its detailed report on the Bill, particularly noting the committee's emphasis on ensuring equity and access in the admissions policies of Irish schools.  This ambition is shared by the Department, which commits to creating an education system in which everyone has access to an excellent education that is inclusive of all, irrespective of belief system, race, ethnicity, class, culture, gender, language or ability.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was signed into law in July 2018.  The overall objective of the Act is to provide a framework for school enrolment that is designed to ensure that every child is catered for and that the way in which schools decide on applications for admission is transparent.  It requires all schools to set out clearly the admissions criteria that are used for parents and prospective parents.  <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the Traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single-sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.  The Act also sets out certain criteria that schools cannot take into account when deciding on an application for admission, such as consideration of a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude, consideration of a parent's occupation, financial status, academic ability, skills or aptitude, apart from exceptions provided by the Act, as a consideration for the offer of a school place.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2020, certain sections of the Act were commenced in order to be operational in time for the admission processes for the 2021-2022 school year.  From February 2020 all recognised schools in Ireland were required to draft a new school admission policy in accordance with the Act's requirements.  These new admission policies which have been approved by patrons after consultation with parents of children attending the school, are now published on individual school websites.  These policies applied for admission to school for the first time last September.  As such, the operation of this Act and its provisions remains in relatively early stages.  Schools have worked extremely hard in developing, consulting on and drafting these new policies.  The Act requires that any subsequent changes to a school's admission policy requires the approval process to be undertaken again before the admission policy could be published by the school.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill proposes to delete section 62(10)(b) of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018.  The section that the Bill proposes to delete allows schools, and this is an important consideration, if they so desire, to take into account a student's connection to a school by virtue of a parent or grandparent having previously attended the school when deciding on an application for admission to that school.  This is subject to a limit of 25% on the number of available places that can be filled by a school using this criterion.  This was used in recognition of the ties which parents, grandparents and broader families may have to schools.  The use of this provision is subject to the discretion of the school, and it should also be noted that this criteria has no impact on schools where there is no oversubscription.<\/p>  <p>  The Department sought information from management bodies of schools in relation to the use and impact of this provision in respect of school admissions for September 2021.  The responses received from schools indicated that there are a minimal number of schools nationally that use the full 25% provided for in the Act.  At primary level, 907 schools responded to the survey, and of these only 4.7% of them use this criterion.  At post-primary 537 responded with 19% applying this provision.  However it is worthwhile to note that only 17 of these schools used the full 25% allowed for by the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The joint education committee has made a number of recommendations in its report, which will be considered fully by my Department.  The committee recommends establishing an expert group to review and compile data on school admission policies.  I am supportive of this recommendation.  I am also very mindful that the current admission processes of schools is relatively new and has only taken effect for the first time for admission to the 2020-2021 school year.  To be effective, a longer timeframe is required for the Department and expert group, as recommended by the committee, to undertake a review and compilation of data to provide an opportunity for a greater analysis and evaluation of the measure set against a number of school admission cycles.  This would also avoid burdening schools with having to amend school admission policies so soon after they were implemented for the 2020-2021 school year.  I look forward to engaging with the committee further on the nature of such a review as recommended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900049#AAA00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1652974800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for his work on this.  He has dealt with what I am going to discuss, and a lot more eloquently than I will.  What we are talking about is straightforward.  It is education as the great leveller, to use Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's words.  We are talking about ensuring that there is an equal playing field in respect of access.  I welcome the fact that there has been an element of analysis and it looks like there is going to be a further element of analysis.  As for every piece of legislation, due diligence should be done.  However, I think we have to get some sort of timeline and look at the possibility of actually introducing these provisions.<\/p>  <p>  They are not going to impact on every school.  We get that even from the numbers the Minister has provided.  We know that.  It is not about every school.  It is the fact that there are schools that are able to use this restriction or obstacle, this 25%, for those with family connections.  On some level that sounds all right but in some cases it stops people who do not have a previous connection to an area from going to a school that they live incredibly close to.<\/p> <p>Beyond that, there can be a difficulty if someone's parents have not gone to a school.  Siblings might not be able to go to the same school if they do not have the connections.<\/p> <p> There are many issues here.  If we are talking about education as a means of giving people the ability to break the poverty cycle, we have to realise that the main issue is much broader.  We know it is not just about access to schools and dealing with fees and third level costs; we know a serious amount of intervention needs to occur at a very early stage in a child's life.  There must be a particular emphasis on pre-primary and primary schooling.  However, that is for another day.  I am blue in the face talking about early interventions that are needed, particularly for communities and families, to make a real difference.<\/p> <p> What we have is inequity in that certain people are given an advantage.  It also means certain schools have the ability to game the system to ensure they get who they want.  No school is going to say it will refuse someone on the basis of their being a Traveller or on the basis of academic ability or a disability, but a school has the ability to ensure the continuity of the old school-tie network or whatever term people want to use.  We need to cast that into the bin alongside all the other inequities we lived with throughout the history of the State and before that.  It is very straightforward; there is something that could be and in some cases is an impediment to some pupils in gaining access to education.  It could entail a school in close proximity.  Long before we get into the issues in the public domain, we know insufficient modelling has been done on the needs that arise owing to autism and other disabilities.  A wider piece of work has not been done and unfortunately families are now dealing with absolutely dreadful circumstances in which they are not quite sure what secondary school their children will be able to attend.  We all know the information existed and that kids in primary school with certain requirements will have those requirements in secondary school.  It is not beyond us to put a system in play that can deal with that, no more than we need to up our game regarding workforce planning to ensure we provide all the necessary disability services and have enough occupational therapists and speech and language therapists where they are needed.<\/p> <p> Across the board, we need significantly better modelling and planning.  That is accepting there will be difficulties.  We cannot just click our fingers and have perfection; however, at a minimum, we can introduce equality or equity &ndash; call it what you will &ndash; regarding the ability of people to gain access to secondary schools.  We are aware that connections have been advantageous in gaining access to certain schools, both fee-paying and non-fee-paying.  On one level, our report reinforces the fact that certain people, and probably many in here, have had advantages that many on the periphery have not had.<\/p> <p> What is proposed is a very simple solution to introduce an element of equity to remove obstacles that can be put in people's way.  We need to find some sort of timely means of introducing it.  It is a very fair ask by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  The Minister must show it is possible and put in place a timeline; we cannot just have endless analysis.  That is not to take away from the fact that some analysis is needed.  Beyond that, we need to fit our work into the wider body of work that needs to be done regarding interventions for communities and families.  In particular, we must invest in disadvantaged areas and communities on the periphery of society.  We can play our part in ensuring that we do not reinforce, over a lifetime, the disadvantages that give people far less choice.  We all know there are many bad choices that can be made and that one is more likely to make one if one has a certain postcode.  We have to break the cycle.  We can do so only by ensuring that we reintroduce equity, even through small moves such as the legislation we are reviewing.  Beyond that, we must put in resources.  If we do not, we will pay for everything and they will be an abject failure societally and economically and in the criminal justice system.  Unfortunately, it will represent the continuation of many failures.<\/p> <p> The Minister has an opportunity to move this on.  It is the right thing to do.  The right thing is something we could do with doing in this place at least occasionally.  In addition to doing it, a wider body of work needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900049#AAA00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652975400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies for their contributions on the committee report and the broader issues related to the admissions Act.  It sets out important requirements on transparency that must be adhered to in schools' admissions policies.  I am conscious that the Act was commenced fully only in the past academic year.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the need to tackle disadvantage across society.  Significant resources have been made available by the Department of Education to target disadvantage in education specifically.  The Deputy will be aware that the single biggest investment in the DEIS programme was recently announced by me.  Through the programme, significant resources are being made available to schools in areas with a significant level of disadvantage, to the tune of &euro;18 million this year and rising to &euro;32 million next year.  It is very much about giving the optimum opportunity and support to all students, irrespective of their socioeconomic background or experience.<\/p>  <p>  On the admissions policy, which has been raised, I am conscious that it is new.  I am also conscious that all schools are required to do significant work to update their admissions policies.  This has been a considerable undertaking for them.  The policy has now operated for just one school cycle, namely, the 2021&ndash;22 school cycle.  Even in that short time, we have been given an opportunity for some learnings, but not complete learnings.  As I referred to earlier, even the information sought from the management bodies of schools on the use and impact of the provision has made for some findings.  At primary level, the survey responses came from 907 schools and indicate that only 4.7% of those schools use or invoke the criterion in question.  At post primary level, 537 schools responded, with 19% applying the provision. <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that the joint committee has made a recommendation, in its report, on the concept of an expert group and on that group having an opportunity to compile data that would reflect how the policy is working, specifically in respect of where, if, when and how the 25% limit is being implemented.  It is clearly the view of the joint committee that there are learnings in this regard.  I acknowledge that the Deputies have acknowledged the importance of having learnings.  I propose that we take the opportunity to work on the joint committee's recommendation to have an expert group.<\/p> <p>The Department of Education is happy to do that.  I consider this a significant and positive way forward because it will give us an opportunity to analyse the data as they become available and make an informed judgment on how the admission policies are operating.  There is an obligation on us to show we have taken informed decisions and have taken the time to inform ourselves of the operation of our schools.  I propose we work with the recommendation of the joint committee for an expert group, which will work with the Department of Education in this area.  I thank both Deputies for the time they have taken to engage in the important issue of schools admissions policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900050#BBB00200","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652976000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I do not know where to start with the Minister's response.  I am infuriated by it.  The last paragraph, in particular, I find infuriating.  I am beginning to wonder why we bother.  The Minister asked for 12 months to do what she has just said she now needs to start.  I stood here in November 2020 asking her to take seriously that, as a matter of basic equality, somebody's father, grandfather, mother or grandmother should be irrelevant when it comes to education.  The Minister asked to be given 12 months.  In good faith, we gave her 12 months.  What did she do with the 12 months?  Now, after the education committee went through hearing after hearing with every expert who came in saying it needed to go, she comes back in and tells me we need another review and more time for another period of school admission cycles.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister bluntly why the private school sector clicks its fingers and gets what it wants.  Why do representatives of that sector come to the Minister for Education or people close to her and say they want a new admissions Bill to make sure the royal blood line of succession continues in private schools because they want the school ties to remain, because that is what their elitism is based on?  It all comes down to money, that is, the money that they have and want to keep in their schools, from the same families.  That is the whole point of it.  They want 25% of their school places kept over to that money and those families.<\/p>  <p>  It should not matter a damn where your da went to school, or if he went.  It should not matter a damn where your grandfather went to school, or if he went.  This odious legislation containing this odious amendment states you have more rights to admission to a secondary school or primary school based on who your parents or grandparents are.  I gave the Minister a year to sort it out and she comes back in and asks for more time and more school admission cycles. <\/p>  <p>  It drives me to distraction to consider the power that the fee-paying lobby has.  There is nothing they will not get if they ask for it.  Proof is in this legislation.  The only ones who asked for it were them.  They got it and we cannot move it because we have another review.  Not one expert witness came into the committee and said it needed to stay.  The only argument for it to stay was that it was rarely used.<\/p>  <p>  I am losing faith in this process because I went through the process of producing legislation and hoping it might be selected for debate.  I was successful.  The Minister asked me to give her a year and I said I would work with her on that.  Did I get a phone call from the Department of Education at any point in those 12 months to talk about the admissions Bill?  Of course I did not.  Did the Minister seek a meeting with me to talk about the Bill in those 12 months?  Of course she did not.  We went through the facade of the education committee, which I prioritised in my time.  The Minister brought in all these experts who prioritised their time to come in and offer their expertise on the basis for inequality which is in this Act.  Then we bring it back here on a Thursday evening and the Minister tells me she needs more time and more school admission cycles.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamentally, we have here proof that as long as those who want to lobby effectively for legislation to benefit them have deep pockets, it will work.  The system will bend over backwards for them and when somebody identifies this as a problem, it will be reviewed to death until, hopefully, the likes of me lose faith.<\/p>  <p>  For all the numerous successes I acknowledge the Minister has had in her role, this type of response on this Thursday evening in a pretty vacant D&aacute;il Chamber makes me lose faith.  The Minister has no answer as to why it should stay.  She has no defence and no argument as to why one child should have a better chance of accessing school because of who their family is than another.  It disproportionately hurts Travellers, those whose parents did not go to secondary school, those who do not come from the area and those who do not come from the country, yet it is stuck there in legislation because the private school sector wants it there and we will leave it there rather than use some energy to delete it.<\/p>  <p>  My faith in the process is extinguished.  The time the Minister is asking for now is the time I assumed she was using in the year she asked from me before this was moved on Second Stage.  What was the point?  What was the Minister doing in those 12 months?  What was going on?  Clearly, the Department does not want to change this provision and wants it to remain.  Clearly, we think it is in concert and in tune with the ethics, values and vision of a republic that child A from family A has more rights because their father and grandfather went to school than child B, who has none of those advantages.  I am exasperated to read a response such as that.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know what difference my contribution will make or if it will make any difference.  The Minister's response is an insult to me and my efforts, to the committee, to every expert who came into the committee and to the representatives of all the organisations who gave up time to attend the committee and to give presentations and analysis, every one of whom said it needed to go.  It is an insult to all of them for the Minister to come in here, having had a year between November 2020 and November 2021 in which clearly the Department did nothing, and to tell me and other Deputies that she needs more time.  She wants to review this amendment to death because she, I and Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; know that the private school sector gets what it wants when it clicks its fingers.  That is fundamentally what this is about.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister can have her review but she has lost my goodwill.  When anybody asks me again about the potential for Government to work with Opposition to achieve something with ethics at its heart, I will have to tell them I am not sure if I have faith in it any more.  You give good faith, and it is not afforded to you in return.   You are reviewed and reviewed until you lose your good faith.  All we are trying to achieve is that every child has the same opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051900051#CCC00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652976000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652976000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ar 5.50 p.m. go dt&iacute; 2 p.m., D&eacute; M&aacute;irt, an 24 Bealtaine 2022.\r\n\r\nThe D&aacute;il adjourned at at 5.50 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 May 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
