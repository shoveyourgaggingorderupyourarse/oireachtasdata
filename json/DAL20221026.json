In my view, the HSE must expand the sample audit to a full review of all files in north Kerry, going back 15 years, as a matter of urgency.  As the Minister of State knows, the Maskey report found that significant harm was caused to 46 children in south Kerry and that a further 240 were placed at risk of serious harm.  Since that report was published, I have spoken to social workers, parents, patients and former patients.  I spoke to a social worker who expressed concern about the supervision of children when there was no consultant psychiatric cover.  The social worker told me that requests were made for a review of children who attended CAMHS from 2005 to 2015, when a consultant psychiatrist was eventually appointed.  The concerns that she raised at that time were not addressed.  The social worker told me that many children were placed on strong psychotropic medication, with poor follow-up.  That was not even in Kerry but in another county.<\/p>  <p>  Some parents may even be unaware that their children were under the care of CAMHS because it happened prior to the HSE taking over in 2014.  I spoke to the parents of a child in the north Kerry area who is now in his mid-20s.  He was a promising sports player but does not leave the house now.  He suffered huge weight gain.  His life has been destroyed.  He was later told by another doctor that there was really not much wrong with him that justified that treatment and overmedication.  Parents who were desperate to get help for their children trusted doctors but were let down.  Their agony must not be prolonged by any more indecision and delays.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State called for a full review but that has not happened.  I am repeating the call for a full review.  On the heels of the Maskey report, we were told that there are reports that the medical practitioner at the centre of south Kerry CAMHS may have been assigned to north Kerry CAMHS patients.  That was reported by RT&Eacute;.  The sample audit of the north Kerry CAMHS patients was announced eight months ago.  The scope was limited to a sample of 10% of current patients or about 50 cases.  That sample audit was not enough then, as we said then and are saying again now.  The history of overmedication, no supervision, poor governance and lack of clinical oversight predates the HSE taking over in 2014.  I hear that complaints were made by social workers about poor follow-up in the Cork area from 2010 to 2012.  I also am concerned that south Kerry families are being let down.  They are not receiving therapies that they were promised and some therapies that were received were only online.  Despite requests from me to the Minister for Health and the HSE to extend the sample audit to a full review of all north Kerry CAMHS patients over the past 15 years, the HSE has rigidly adhered to the sample audit.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat my call to the Minister of State.  The consequences for children, many of whom are now adults, are far too serious for anything other than a full review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600003#A00500","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1666771920,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am aware of the issues raised last week in the RT&Eacute; \"Drivetime\" programme.  The health and safety of children in CAMHS should remain the concern of us all.  The independent Maskey report of the review of care provided by south Kerry CAMHS made findings regarding significant failings across multiple levels of the system and made 35 recommendations to improve service delivery.<\/p> <p>Those recommendations cover a broad range of areas, such as the re-establishment of trust in CAMHS, governance of the service, delivery of clinical services, improved clinical practice and the use of information and communications technology to support the delivery of services.  The Government and the HSE are committed to implementing the recommendations as quickly as possible.  At the moment 16 of the 35 recommendations are in place.<\/p> <p> Deputy Daly said to me that a full review is not under way.  Actually, it is, as a full review of all 73 CAMHS teams across the country is under way.<\/p> <p> To provide assurance to those who use CAMHS, I requested the HSE to commission national audits in respect of prescribing practice, compliance with the HSE CAMHS operational guidelines and research on service users' and key stakeholders' experiences of CAMHS.  Those are three independent audits.  Independently chaired by Dr. Colette Halpin, the audit of prescribing practice in CAMHS is undertaken by an expert team, which is administratively supported by the HSE national centre for clinical audit and community operations.  Following an initial pilot phase, the full national audit commenced in July.  Data analysis has now commenced, with findings to be summarised in a final report prepared by the expert team.<\/p> <p> This all came about, as Deputy Daly will know, because of the situation in south Kerry CAMHS.  The HSE is conducting three individual audits.  Also, and this is important, I requested that the Mental Health Commission, which is independent of both me and the HSE, undertake a review of all 73 CAMHS teams across the country.  When both report I will have two parallel reports, which I think will give me great data I never had previously.<\/p> <p> As for the situation in north Kerry, I believe that the random sample audit works.  The reason we know it works is that it worked in south Kerry.  We did a random sample audit of 50 files.  Dr. Maskey identified at that time that significant harm had been done to children and that other children were also affected.  As a result of that, a full look-back was done.  However, I have to wait for the results of the random sample audit files, whether it is north Kerry, Waterford, Galway or Dublin, to see the results.  If then a full look-back is required, I will make sure that happens.  I have to go by the procedures Dr. Maskey put in place because I know they work.  They worked in south Kerry.  Fifty sample files showed there were issues.  We will have to await the results of this.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, massive supports have been put in place.  The HSE continues to engage with families locally, including the Kerry CAMHS family support group, on care and any other issues generally relating to the Maskey report.  Those affected can contact the HSE, as the Deputy will know.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, and I will come back to the Deputy in my supplementary response, I travelled to Tralee in August and launched the youth advocacy programme, YAP, for all users of CAMHS in south and north Kerry who want to advocate for themselves with the support of their parents.  An independent advocacy group is in place to support all service users of CAMHS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600003#A00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666772520,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  The only problem is that some of these families have been waiting 15 years since the misdiagnoses and the overprescribing of antipsychotic medication to their children.  They are suffering internally in their family units and their children are still suffering as a result of what happened.  The random sample, I believe, will lead only to a look-back.  At least 25 families have come to my office to ask that they be included in the north Kerry review.  Unless there is a huge proportion of people coming into my office, which is highly unlikely, a full review will be necessary.  It was announced eight months ago.  It was supposed to have been published within six months.  That has not happened.  It is supposed to be announced this week.  That is the latest I have been told.  I was told that about a week ago.  It is not happening.  The families are getting more frustrated and the status of patients who were treated pre-2016 is still up in the air.  The south Kerry difficulties dealt with a specific period from 2016 onward, but the Minister of State and I know that the problems were there before the HSE took over the Brothers of Charity Services in 2014, going back 15 or 16 years.  Some of those patients are now in their mid-20s and are still suffering, so they are getting increasingly frustrated by what they see as inaction.  Their problems will continue.

What I requested at that stage across all 73 CAMHS teams was a sample random audit because I knew that it had worked in south Kerry.  Fifty files were audited and they showed immediately that there were issues.  Then Dr. Maskey performed a full look-back into, if my memory serves me right, about 1,250 files.  We should also note that there were 500 files of children who were medicated where no harm was caused to them.  It is important to say that.<\/p>  <p>  I have to await the outcomes of these and the other audits on CAMHS nationally that are under way, including the review by the Mental Health Commission.  This will help to inform any next steps necessary in respect of CAMHS in Kerry or elsewhere.  I want to build back confidence in the CAMHS teams.  We have 73 teams in operation at the moment.  We will have a 74th team in Wexford very soon.  It is important to state, however, that 2% of children who are referred through a GP or a primary care centre may need the support of CAMHS.  A huge amount of really good, positive work is being done by multidisciplinary CAMHS teams the length and breadth of the country.  It is really important that I try to support those teams to continue to do the really good work they have done, notwithstanding the issues we have.  The focus for me, the Department and the HSE is to complete as quickly as possible the various audits now under way along with monitoring take-up of the compensation scheme.

The damage the report reveals is being done to our waters is incredibly worrying.  Some 51% of Ireland's sewage was treated to the European standard set to protect our environment, well below the EU average of 90%.  There are areas across the country that failed the EU treatment standards, but half of them are in Cork: Clonakilty and Kinsale, in my constituency, as well as Carrigaline, Cobh, Rathcormack and Mitchelstown.  Then there are the 32 areas where raw sewage is just being discharged into rivers and the sea, including Castletownsend, in Cork South-West.  Unless they lived in or visited these areas, I think most people would find it unimaginable that in 2022, we are still dumping raw sewage directly into our waters.<\/p>  <p>  This is symptomatic of underinvestment in water infrastructure.  There are many issues Irish Water needs to address but the Minister cannot pass the buck.  Issues with wastewater treatment are one of the major matters I deal with in my office, from the lack of a proper support system in Shannon Vale to malodours from wastewater treatment plants in Kinsale, Castletownbere and Belgooly.  Each time I bring this up here or ask a parliamentary question, I am told it is the responsibility of Irish Water, allowing the Minister to wash his hands of the matter.  That is not good enough because, ultimately, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has responsibility for water quality.<\/p>  <p>  This hypocrisy was most clear earlier in the year, when the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, visited Shannon Vale to see the impact of the lack of proper infrastructure.  A formerly beautiful park in the centre of the village is now a dangerous and polluted area due to the inadequate wastewater system.<\/p> <p>I tried to ask a parliamentary question following the Minister's visit but it was disallowed because he apparently has no responsibility for Irish Water.  The Minister was implying to the community that he could do something about the issue while apparently having no role in resolving it afterwards.<\/p> <p> Irish Water has an operational function but the issues raised in the EPA report relate to capital investment, which is definitely the Government's responsibility.  It clearly states that based on current investment levels, it will take at least two decades to get all treatment facilities up to standards.  The EPA has found that it will take a multibilllion euro investment and, based on current investment levels, at least two decades to get all treatment systems up to standard.  That is simply unacceptable.<\/p> <p> Some areas in Ireland are looking at the release of wastewater below health and environmental standards well into the 2040s.  There is a clear need for accelerated investment.  Each year, the EPA produces these reports and there is slow progress but this is shockingly slow.  New plans such as Castletownbere have come online but they have their own problems.  I have to once again point out the importance of investment in public services such as education, disability services, healthcare and now, water services, rather than giving tax cuts to wealthier people.  Every year, the Government chooses not to invest in water infrastructure and it is another year that our waters are polluted.<\/p> <p> This report only deals with wastewater.  It does not mention the areas in Cork South-West and throughout the country where drinking water facilities are at capacity.

Having a well-functioning and resilient wastewater treatment infrastructure that will protect our environment is an issue of national importance and I appreciate the Deputy's concern in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  Irish Water's primary function is to provide clean, safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment.  In turn, the EPA holds Irish Water to account for its environmental performance.  The EPA is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the necessary quality standards for the collection and treatment of wastewater discharges.<\/p>  <p>  As part of budget 2023, we secured funding of more than &euro;1.65 billion to support water services, with &euro;1.56 billion of this allocated to Irish Water.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater infrastructure.  In 2021, Irish Water invested &euro;367 million in wastewater, which is the highest annual level to date.<\/p>  <p>  Many serious challenges remain which will take significant investment, as the Deputy pointed out.  The EPA has identified in this report the priority areas where Irish Water must target its available resources to deliver improvements where they are most needed and will bring the greatest environmental benefits.  Irish Water is also working to ensure that new capacity is made available for housing and commercial development.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water's investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies throughout Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes to deliver improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.  It is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and wastewater infrastructure, including compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive.<\/p>  <p>  Some 93% of Ireland's public wastewater plants are compliant with the urban wastewater treatment directive.  The vast majority - 90% - of the total wastewater load that is not yet in compliance with the directive requirements comes from one treatment area, namely, the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant which serves Dublin and the surrounding area.  Irish Water is investing more than &euro;500 million in the staged upgrading of Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, which will deliver the capacity to treat the wastewater for a population equivalent of 2.4 million people, while achieving the standards of the urban wastewater treatment directive, by 2025.  Irish Water also has plans in place to address any outstanding issues at the remaining non-compliant plants.  Some 40% of the 90% of sewage about which the Deputy spoke comes from Ringsend, which will be brought up to standard by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, Irish Water has eliminated 60%, by volume, of all raw sewage discharges through targeted investment in new sewage infrastructure and is on target to eliminate nearly all of the remainder by 2025.  This work represents investment in 21 areas where there was no sewage treatment before.<\/p>  <p>  Urban wastewater pressures are impacting on 208 water bodies.  This equates to 4% of water bodies, nationally, where urban wastewater improvement measures are required to achieve water framework directive objectives.  Works are complete to address urban wastewater pressures on 12 water bodies and projects are progressing in 61 further water bodies.  Another 63 water bodies have assessments under way and for the remaining 72 water bodies, assessments will be initiated in a rolling programme to be completed by 2029.<\/p>  <p>  Collection networks will also need to be improved and adapted to a changing climate.  However, these projects are complex, especially in cities, and will therefore take considerably longer to address.  The number of areas on the EPA's priority action list has been reduced by one third since 2017.  Irish Water has a plan to complete works at all plants on the list by 2030.  We have a river basin management plan with public consultation that has to be ambitious.  With regard to the pressures that we are seeing on receiving bodies of water, the issue of urban wastewater is reducing and agriculture has taken over as the most significant factor.  Significant improvements are being made but I absolutely accept the Deputy's points that are still outstanding.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600005#C00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1666773120,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, that is the exact stock answer I have come to expect.  This is a pressing health and environmental issue.  Raw sewage and poorly treated wastewater impact on local ecology and has public health implications.  Wastewater in Kinsale and Clonakilty, two of Ireland's major tourist destinations, has failed to meet EU treatment standards and raw sewage is being discharged into picturesque Castletownsend.<\/p>  <p>  These areas need Government investment, rather than the Minister of State passing the buck to Irish Water.  The Government needs to provide the investment and then meet with Irish Water management to ensure that the projects are prioritised.  The EPA report clearly warns that, at current rates, we are still decades away from resolving this issue.  The problem is even more nuanced as the new plant in Castletownbere, similar to ones in Kinsale and Belgooly, regularly have malodours coming from it.  Castletownbere is being held as an example of success in this report and by Irish Water in the media afterwards, when it is awful for locals.  This gives an example of where we are at.  <\/p>  <p>  Related to this are the exorbitant connection costs.  At-standard cost for a single household is almost &euro;2,300.

I raised this issue on 19 January on the floor of the D&aacute;il and raised it again on 30 March.  I have raised it at the Committee of Public Accounts a number of times and have also raised it in a series of parliamentary questions.  I am raising it again this morning because it is really important that we get a domestic violence refuge in the county.<\/p>  <p>  The third national strategy on domestic violence issues was launched recently and I welcome that.  In that strategy, 12 locations in the country which do not have domestic violence refuges, including, nine counties, are identified as priorities.  Laois is one of the counties identified, as is Offaly.  The midlands is without one of these centres as there is no refuge in either Laois or Offaly.  Domestic abuse services in Laois and Offaly are both doing great work but are under pressure.  The pandemic brought its own problems but there was a 38% increase in demand last year.  We were coming out of the pandemic at that stage but unfortunately, domestic violence is an increasing problem.  It is a cultural, educational and societal problem.  In the Laois centre, there was a 38% increase year on year in the number of clients supported, with 505 people receiving actual support.  People working in the service tell me that the cases are becoming more complex and the annual reports of domestic violence services show that clearly.  The services can only do so much without a safe refuge for people, sometimes men but mainly women and children, who are trying to escape domestic violence.  <\/p>  <p>  There is little or no emergency accommodation available in the county.  Laois County Council is really firefighting at the moment in terms of the provision of homeless accommodation.  Unfortunately, the fact that people are fleeing Putin's illegal war in Ukraine is bringing its own pressures.  Accommodation that might have been available in the social housing system or by way of HAP tenancies is becoming more difficult to source and there are waiting lists for emergency accommodation.  Typically, people are being sent out of the county to access services, which means taking them away from local schools, doctors and other services and away from family supports.  <\/p>  <p>  The Laois Domestic Abuse Service has a four-year strategic plan and it was confirmed to me again yesterday that a refuge is the number one priority for the staff and the board.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that capital funding has been announced for a refuge in Laois and that money will not be a barrier.  Can he assure me that if the jigsaw can be put together in terms of identifying a suitable site and so on, the money will be forthcoming?  A strategy group is in place locally and is working on this.  Tusla is working with that group, along with a number of other stakeholders.  It is really important that money does not become the barrier to getting a refuge in place.  People are at their most vulnerable when they are escaping domestic violence.  Often women and children go back into abusive situations because they have no other option.  They need a refuge space to feel safe, get their head together, access support services and to plan a way forward.

As part of this, it contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.  As a start, the strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places.  This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces.  We will also work to deliver additional safe house and step-down accommodation.  We have identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of additional family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.  These priority areas, as the Deputy is aware, include Portlaoise, where eight family places are suggested as a potential refuge size requirement.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister is informed by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, that a group involving local stakeholders, including the Laois Domestic Abuse Service, has been established to take forward plans to develop the proposed refuge and associated support services.  Planning is not yet at the stage to identify the specific amount of either capital or revenue funding required.  Furthermore, planning is not sufficiently advanced to identify the specific timelines for completion of the refuge, but Tusla and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be working with local stakeholders to support and ensure the process progresses as fast as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, due to the variations in sites, resources available and specific local features, the costs for each of the planned refuge developments will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on funding will be supported into the future by work being progressed nationally to develop principles for refuge design.  Tusla will continue to engage with stakeholders to support the refuge development process in County Laois.  The Minister informs me that in 2022, the Laois Domestic Abuse Service was allocated &euro;281,440, with &euro;79,000 in additional funding to strengthen its capacity for the provision of supports to women and to further develop services to children impacted by domestic violence and abuse.  Additional resources such as project management support and other supports for capacity building will be available to the Laois Domestic Abuse Service and other organisations taking forward refuge developments in the 12 priority locations, as outlined in the third national strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600006#D00300","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1666773720,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's reply.  The point I want to make strongly is that typically, women and children fleeing domestic violence would be sent to emergency accommodation or refuges but the supply of emergency accommodation, which is typically in the private rental or bed-and-breakfast sector, is drying up.  In many cases it is also not suitable for women and children fleeing domestic violence situations.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the strategy has a particular focus on prevention and on ensuring that victims are better supported.  The delivery of refuge accommodation is central to that.  While I welcome that element of the Minister of State's reply, I am a bit concerned by his statement that the \"costs for each of the planned refuge developments will be considered on a case-by-case basis\".  That is fair enough but I ask him to restate the overall figure and to confirm that it is still available.  As I recall, funding in excess of &euro;300 million was announced for the strategy and I ask for confirmation that the money is there to provide these much-needed centres in each of the areas that do not have one, including County Laois.  Offaly is putting forward a different solution and that is fine.  The domestic violence service there is doing good work but the geographic situation in that county is different.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of site options are being considered in Laois and I do not believe finding a site will be a problem.  There is great local commitment to the development of a refuge from the local authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and various other stakeholders.  Ms Marna Carroll, the service director of Laois Domestic Abuse Service, and her staff have done Trojan work and I commend them on all of their efforts, particularly over the last couple of years through the pandemic.  It has not been easy for them.  All public representatives in the area have had occasion to refer people to the service, sometimes too often.  It is really important that we do this, that we give women and children support at that vulnerable point in their lives.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me on that.  I ask him to confirm that the pounds, shillings and pence are available and that money will not be a barrier when a suitable site is located.  We must move these projects on quickly.  We do not want them to take forever and a day.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that these projects must be up and running quickly.  We do not want any delays.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600006#D00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1666773720,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Again, I thank Deputy Stanley for raising the very important matter of the domestic violence refuge accommodation that is necessary in County Laois.

I do not have the global figure to hand, but I will get it for the Deputy.  I assure him that funding is in place to support the establishment and building of necessary refuge accommodation over the coming years.<\/p> <p> As previously mentioned, the central element of the new strategy is that everyone who needs a refuge space should be able to access once.  When someone is faced with the difficult choice to leave an abusive situation, the Minister wants them to know exactly where they can turn to for help.  Over the lifetime of this strategy, we will see the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces.  The Minister believes that we will be putting in place the correct structures to deliver additional refuge accommodation now, including the development of a new strategy, and that it will accelerate the number of additional spaces that can be opened each year.  Work undertaken in implementing the strategy has already prepared the way for this, including a significant increase in funding as part of budget 2023.  An interdepartmental group is developing and progressing agreed processes and approaches to ensure that we will have the highest standard of refuge accommodation delivered in the most efficient way.  The Minister knows that there is much to do, but, along with our Government colleagues, we are determined to do whatever is necessary.<\/p> <p> Again, I will read the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister.

We are facing an unprecedented housing, homelessness, and accommodation crisis.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been let down by the Government not providing the most basic thing, namely, a secure, affordable roof over the heads of individuals, families, and children.  There are 122,000 households on the various housing lists.  Almost 11,000 families, including 3,000 children, are in homeless accommodation.  Thousands of Ukrainians, who have fled war and conflict and are in desperate situations, are being failed by the State and the Government not providing a basic thing, which is to have a roof over their heads.<\/p>  <p>  The motion points out that the answer to this crisis is staring us in the face.  According to the census, there are 160,000 vacant properties in this country, 48,000 of which had been empty for the six years since the previous census.  In addition, although we do not do a proper count of derelict properties, it is estimated that there are at least 20,000 derelict properties.  The answer to the housing crisis, to the homelessness misery, and to the desperate situation of Ukrainians who need and deserve our assistance, is staring us in the face.  It is for the State and the Government to take the necessary action to bring derelict properties into use to house all those who need a secure, affordable roof over their heads.<\/p>  <p>  We are proposing a number of measures that could begin to address the crisis because we do not want to just give out about the situation.  The central solution, which we have not even included in the motion because we have put it out there so many times, as have others, is for the Government to dramatically ramp up construction of its own public and affordable housing on the abundant public land that is out there.  To understand the scale of the Government's failure in this regard, I refer to my area, which is one of the areas worst affected by the housing crisis.  Even if the targets are met in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area, when the Housing for All plan concludes in 2026, more people being on the housing waiting list than there are now.  That is how inadequate the plan is.<\/p>  <p>  As our motion sets out, the Government is failing spectacularly to meet its own targets for the delivery of social and affordable housing.  The Government's target for 2022 is 9,000 social homes, but it had delivered only 1,500 halfway through the year.  The Government promised 4,100 affordable and cost rental homes, but it has only delivered 325 affordable homes and 234 cost-rental homes halfway through the year.  These are hopelessly inadequate targets.  The ability of the Government to implement even its own targets is hopelessly inadequate.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge that, albeit belatedly and under massive pressure from the Opposition and as a result of the public outcry, the Government finally brought in an eviction ban.  If you want to address an unprecedented homelessness crisis, the obvious thing to do is to prevent further people from being driven into homelessness, which the Government has allowed to happen on a spectacular level over recent years.  In just one year, the number of people in homeless accommodation went from 8,400 to 10,800 because the Government allowed people to be evicted into homelessness.  Looking at the situation in Tathony House, Dublin 8, you get an idea of the motivations behind people being driven into homelessness.  The owner of the 35 properties is estimated to be making an income of &euro;700,000 per year and is claiming financial hardship as a justification for evicting 35 households.  That is absolutely disgusting.  Even the eviction ban the Government brought in has a loophole such that any tenant who got a termination date before the introduction of the legislation could be evicted in the coming months, in the depths of winter, which is something the Government had better amend in the legislation that will come before the House this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to immediate solutions.  If we have 166,000 empty properties, of which 48,000 have been empty for six years, and 20,000 derelict properties, the answer is simply for the Government to take those properties under its control, refurbish them and use the necessary construction capacity to make them available as social and affordable housing.  However, the Government refuses to do that.  For four years, I have been pointing to an example of that in my area.  Some 17 apartments at St. Helen's Court have been empty for two to three years and the landlord - a vulture fund - has been trying to evict the rest of the tenants for a number of years.  The Government will still not take control of those properties.  We maintain that there should be a use-it-or-lose-it provision.  If a property is vacant for more than six months without good reason, the State should acquire it, by means of compulsory purchase order if necessary, in order to deliver social and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, there are 80,000 sites with planning permission.  In many cases, however, developers are sitting on those sites, drip-feeding housing and watching the value of their properties go up.  In fact, the worse the housing crisis gets, the more money they make from the value of their properties.  Such sites with planning permission should be taken over by the State in order to deliver social and affordable housing,.  The Government should create a State construction company in order that we are not dependent on private developers to do it.  We should do it directly ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600008#F00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1666774620,"counter":31,"content":"<p>None of this is natural or inevitable.  The scale of the housing crisis and how it affects ordinary people is a consequence of policy.  There are almost 11,000 people in emergency accommodation, more than 3,000 of whom are children whose lives will be forever blighted by their experience.  Hundreds of thousands of people are stuck living with their parents because they cannot afford to rent.  Some 250,000 people are on the social housing waiting list, or are on HAP or RAS precarious private tenancies.  Students are asking students unions if they can pitch a tent on campus because they cannot afford a room.  Traveller families are in horrific accommodation.  Now, refugees are unable to find shelter having fled from war.  None of that is natural or inevitable.  It is the consequence of years of aggressive neoliberal policies on housing by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour, and the Green Party.  It is all based on a policy that states the right of those people to a home comes second to the right of developers and big corporate landlords to maximise their profits.<\/p> <p>Fundamentally their right to do what they want with their private property, to maximise their profit, comes before the right of society to say no, we want people in one of the wealthiest countries in the world to have a home.  It is the consequence of commodification, privatisation and financialisation of housing that unfortunately is taking place right around the world.  The issue of vacant properties really gets to the heart of it because this is the most immediate solution to the crisis that people face.  There are vacant properties in every community, town and city throughout the State.  The most immediate solution is to use those vacant properties for people who need them.  It is also the most ecologically sustainable solution because the cost in terms of carbon emissions of bringing the house that is already build up to standard is very low compared to the significant greenhouse gas emissions that come with building a new home.  According to Central Statistics Office, CSO, data, based on the recent census, there are more than 166,000 vacant homes across the country.  Almost 50,000 of those homes have been vacant for six years or more.  Of those 23,000 were vacant even as far back as the 2011 census which is more than ten years ago.  On top of that, at the end of 2021, there were 22,000 derelict buildings in the State.  Even allowing for a certain amount of over-estimation of long-term vacant properties it is clear there is massive potential to bring vacant properties into use immediately as social and affordable homes for the tens of thousands of households desperate for somewhere affordable to live.  The issue is for us to say you do not have a right to leave a home vacant in the context of a housing crisis; that if people do not use it then they will lose it and the State will intervene and compulsorily purchase the home in order to make it available for people to live in.<br\/><br\/>Beyond that is the issue of planning permissions.  An estimated 80,000 housing planning permissions have been granted nationally but not activated.  In the Dublin area the most recent housing supply co-ordination taskforce reports that for the last quarter of 2021 planning permission for about 75,000 homes was granted.  Of those just under 9,000 were completed and 18,000 commenced, leaving an excess of 48,000 unused permissions.  That is almost two in every three planning permissions have not been activated in the middle of a housing catastrophe.  The Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance collected data on strategic housing developments.  By February 2022 that toxic process had granted permission for almost 70,000 units.  Fewer than 13,000 had commenced.  Even allowing for those under judicial review there are still 40,000 unused permissions country-wide.<br\/><br\/>What do we know about who is hoarding this land with planning permissions?  Cairn Homes with a stock valuation of close to &euro;600 million owns landbanks that could accommodate 17,700 homes.  Of these sites 82% have planning permission or are in the planning process.  The vast majority of this land is in or around Dublin.  Yet Cairn Homes plans to complete just 1,500 homes this year, in the middle of a housing crisis.  Similarly Glenbeigh Properties owns landbanks for more than 15,000 homes but completed just over 1,000 in 2021, in the middle of a housing crisis.  Their right to sit on land in order to maximise their profit by building later rather than now is taking precedence over the need for action in regard to the housing crisis.  At the weekend <i>The Business Post <\/i>reported that the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, is now considering buying up &ldquo;dormant housing projects&rdquo; or partnering with other developers.  I can imagine that will involve some handsome profit for them.  Let us acquire these sites at agricultural prices now, cut out the developers and their profiteering, and start direct-building by the State and local authorities.  I do not understand what the Government is waiting for.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis.<br\/><br\/>We need a State construction company to deliver all of this, providing thousands of high-quality well-paid jobs and apprenticeships, working with local authorities to repair and retrofit vacant properties for occupation and to build new homes on the landbanks currently being hoarded.  The market which this Government defends and allows to rule has failed completely to deliver housing for a very long time now.  The State must step in and do what the market will not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600008#F00500","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666775220,"counter":33,"content":"<p>When the Minister, Deputy Noonan, walked in here this morning I asked him why he was here and not the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien.  He said he had pulled the short straw, and indeed he has.<\/p><p>I have noticed that the Minister, unusually, has put in an amendment to our motion.  We have been listening to Private Members&rsquo; motions for months now where there has been no opposition from the Government, it does not argue against us or vote against motions, it just ignores them and lets them run.  This one however has been amended.  I did a wordcount on it.  We have 21 short paragraphs in our motion describing what Deputies Boyd Barrett and Murphy just outlined as to what we think should be a beginning of a solution to the housing crisis.  The Minister responded with 50 long paragraphs.  This place would drive you to drink to be honest because yesterday the same thing happened at the Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  When I asked was there any intention on the part of the Government to go to COP27 and argue for more funding for people who are suffering from the extremes of climate change, a civil servant replied &ldquo;blah blah blah&rdquo; for almost 20 minutes.  Can we get decent answers to reasonable questions?<\/p><p>This motion poses very reasonable questions and I want to pose a few more.  One relates to Tathony House, which has been mentioned, in Kilmainham, Dublin 8.  One of our members, a councillor, lives there and has been there for more than ten years.  They have spent &euro;120,000 on rent in that ten years.  They are now being evicted by a landlord who happens to be, and I say this for a reason because I will follow on with another argument, one of our own, an Irishman called Ronan McDonnell who has made millions out of this block of flats.  He is evicting 35 families.  Those families are not just Irish.  They come from all corners of the planet but they all work here and are rearing their children here.  They are all very scared about what is going to happen to them.  I wrote to Dublin City Council, DCC, immediately and said that this is in its area and we need housing, the people here are on the housing list, what is it going to do about it.  Its answer is basically that there are no housing assistance payment, HAP, or homeless HAP tenancies in Tathony House, there is a very small number of acting housing applications on DCC&rsquo;s list and it is not straight forward for DCC to intervene, that the tenants <i>in situ<\/i>protocol cannot be used unless there are HAP or RAS tenants there.  Whatever we try to do here with these motions, there are always going to be obstacles.  Protocols, rules and regulations are dragged up and brought before us either by local authorities or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The truth of the matter is that it is a perfectly good site for DCC to buy regardless of who lives in it.  We need more public properties into which to get people so that we can house them and give families security.  Even if it was a question of buying it and fixing it up there would be permanent homes for people in the future so that they are not putting &euro;120,000 down the toilet in rent over ten years to be told at the end of it that they are going to be evicted.<\/p><p>This is important in the context of the crisis of Ukraine and the numbers of refugees coming into this country.  It is phenomenal but the numbers are nothing like those going into other countries.  Ireland is in fact down the table on the number of refugees per 100,000 of population that we are taking in.  The biggest number of refugees that move around the world when people are displaced go to some of the poorest countries and are allowed to stay there for years with very few supports.  When people get frustrated, and I understand it, people are sick of listening to Ukraine refugees getting this, that and the other, and what are we going to do about Ukrainian refugees, I get that, but people have to be careful and remind ourselves that long before Russia ever entered Ukraine to embark on a war, long before there was any crisis in Ukraine, or a refugee crisis, we had a deep, extreme housing crisis here.  It was put best to me by a young woman, who has been on the DCC housing list for 19 years, at a public meeting recently in Ballyfermot.  Somebody got up and gave out about the Ukrainian refugees and she said &ldquo;yes, I get it, we all think they are getting everything but I am 19 years on the housing list and that was long before there was ever any crisis in Ukraine&rdquo;.<\/p><p>This housing crisis runs deep.  It will be used to divide people and to put us against each other.  When the question is asked about why we do not look after our own first, let us ask who are our own.  The landlord of Tathony House is one of our own if that how you describe it.  Many of the people who evade paying taxes in this country, many of the landlords who own and sit on empty properties for years and practically all of the politicians in this House, are our own.<\/p> <p>I include in that all of the politicians on the opposite side of the House who, after decades of rule by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, have brought us into this housing crisis and kept us there.<\/p> <p> It is important that the issues be dealt with and that the Minister stop playing games, turn up in the Chamber and defend himself.  His amendment reminds me of Lady Macbeth, who could not protest enough when being accused of doing something of which she tried to say she was innocent.  As Shakespeare wrote, \"The lady doth protest too much, methinks\".  In this case, methinks the Minister doth protest too much because he is guilty of all of the problems that have been laid out this morning.  The solutions have to be found urgently.<\/p> <p> I want the Minister of State to address the question of how we will deal with local authorities that, even when it is necessary, refuse to buy properties from which tenants are being evicted.  Can we deal with specific cases where occupancies do not necessarily tick all of the boxes of local authorities' protocols but do tick the box that is the need of ordinary people and families up and down the country?  This would accrue to us more public housing, which would be in our housing stock on a permanent basis.  In the case of St. Helen's Court, Tathony House or anywhere else, we need to instruct the local authorities to buy, buy and buy where they can, fix the housing up and make it habitable and permanent so that people can live in proper affordable public housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600009#G00200","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666775820,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Deputy, could we avoid naming people in the House?

that the housing supply is increasing, despite such unprecedented challenges arising from the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, increasing interest rates and supply chain issues; in the 12 months to the end of June 2022 almost 25,000 homes were completed and in the 12 months to the end of September 2022 almost 27,500 were commenced, and last year 9,183 social homes were provided, with the Government's target of 24,600 new build homes for this year on track to be met, and all activity is completely focused on meeting the targets in subsequent years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that this increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home; and the Government has made the delivery of new homes (social, affordable and private) its priority through the development, resourcing and implementation of the Housing for All strategy;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that, in this regard, the Government's immediate focus has been on delivering homes for households in the lowest income brackets, and for those facing an affordability challenge, with historic levels of investment (in excess of &euro;20 billion) through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next five years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes, and 18,000 Cost Rental homes; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the recent increase in the number of households in emergency accommodation, through concerted efforts by Government agencies, local authorities and Non-Governmental Organisations, the Government continues to address the housing needs of these households and those at risk of becoming homeless, through a wide range of support programmes, including: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the proposed introduction of a temporary stay on tenancy terminations;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; increased funding for void units;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; reinstating delegated sanction to allow local authorities to pursue appropriate acquisitions; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; modifications to the Repair and Leasing Scheme to open up more opportunities to include conversion of commercial units to residential; <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; Ireland has signed the Lisbon Declaration on the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness, committing to working towards the ending of homelessness by 2030, and agreeing to promote the prevention of homelessness, access to permanent housing and the provision of enabling support services to those who are homeless;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the National Homeless Action Committee has been established; this cross-Government, interagency and stakeholder Committee which is chaired by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage ensures the continued coherence and coordination of homeless related services, policies and actions;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the new Housing First National Implementation Plan 2022-2026 has also been published and expands Housing First targets, with over 1,300 new Housing First tenancies to be introduced over the next five years; in addition, a Housing First National Office was established in March in the Housing Agency to drive the implementation and a National Director for the Programme has been appointed;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; with regard to the delivery of social housing, over 23,300 households had their housing needs met in 2021 &ndash; this is despite the very significant impact the Covid-19 pandemic had on delivery; noting that most residential construction was halted for a 13-week period from January to April;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the 2021 Summary of Social Housing Assessments showed that there were 59,247 households assessed as being qualified for, and in need of, social housing support: a 4.3 per cent decrease on the social housing waiting list in 2020 and a 35.3 per cent decrease in the social housing waiting list since 2016, when the first annual assessment was conducted;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the latest Construction Status Report (Q2 2022) shows 8,247 social homes on-site, with an additional 12,327 homes at design and tender stage, and 118 new construction schemes (1,647 homes) added to the pipeline; in total the Construction Status Report provides details on 27,006 new build social homes across 1,566 schemes;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; notwithstanding the strong delivery pipeline, Minister O'Brien continues to emphasise the urgency of maximising delivery, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working closely with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to secure additional projects to deliver in the short-term;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; with regard to the delivery of affordable homes, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 and the Land Development Agency Act 2021, both enacted July 2021, are two important foundations that will enable the delivery of affordable housing on the scale required;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; taking into account that 2022 will be the first year of affordable housing delivery (affordable housing schemes having been stood down in 2011), the first affordable Cost Rental homes are now beginning to come into the market, advertised at rates that are 40 per cent to 50 per cent lower than market rent; and these Cost Rental homes are designed to assist households currently facing affordability pressures in the private rental market and targets middle-income households, with household net annual income of less than &euro;53,000;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; homes are now being made available under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme and the nationally available First Home Shared Equity Scheme supports first-time buyers purchasing newly constructed homes being made available for sale in the private market;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in addition, a new Local Authority Home Loan has been introduced for those on modest\/low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home and the Help-to-Buy scheme, which has been a significant support for first time buyers, has been extended to the end of 2024;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the LDA has an immediate focus on managing the State's own lands to develop new homes, the majority of which will be social and affordable; and the transfer of State lands to the LDA, with potential to produce 15,000 homes, is underway;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the LDA has also launched Project Tosaigh to accelerate delivery of 5,000 homes on non-State lands where planning permission has already been granted, but not yet activated; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in addition, the Government has launched a new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund Scheme to address the current viability challenges and activate housing supply at density in city centres through the delivery of 5,000 apartments for owner occupiers; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; good progress has been made in advancing the vacancy related actions under the Housing for All strategy, including: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the publication of a 'Town Centre First' approach earlier this year, which provides a co-ordinated, whole-of-Government policy framework to proactively address the decline in the health of towns across Ireland and support measures to regenerate and revitalise them;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the establishment of a 'vacancy' unit within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, led at Principal Officer level, to drive the implementation of the Department's vacancy related actions under the Housing for All strategy;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the move to a fulltime Vacant Homes Officer in all local authorities;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; dedicated support to local authorities and AHBs via the Housing Agency across a number of programmes, and specifically in relation to the Compulsory Purchase Order programme, and working with partners to unlock the potential to utilise heritage buildings for residential purposes;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; reform of the Fair Deal Nursing Home Support Scheme to remove disincentives for the sale\/renting of vacant properties;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; planning regulations, that exempt certain vacant commercial properties from requiring planning permission to change of use for residential purposes, have been extended to 2025;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the successful launch of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund Scheme for vacant property refurbishment grants and the 'Ready to Build' grant; and <\/blockquote>&mdash; the planned introduction of a vacant homes tax in 2023; and <\/blockquote>furthermore, notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; notwithstanding the responsibility of each Chief Executive for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out their functions as housing authorities, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has sanctioned over 200 posts associated with the delivery of their social housing build programmes, with additional posts being sanctioned for affordable housing delivery;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government is also implementing a suite of measures to facilitate increased residential construction activity and put the housing system on a sustainable footing, through, <i>inter alia<\/i>: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the Attorney General-led comprehensive review of planning legislation and a new process for large-scale residential developments of 100 plus units has been introduced to bring supply forward quicker;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; legislation introducing a Residential Zoned Land Tax (commencing in 2024 following publication of maps showing land in scope), coupled with legislation being developed to introduce Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones, these reforms will help to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; activate vacant land zoned and serviced for housing;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; reduce land hoarding that drives up the value of land and cost of housing; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure greater community gain from land value increases; and community gain will be secured through a proportion of the uplift in land values for the provision of infrastructure to support development and, where appropriate, social and affordable housing; <\/blockquote>&mdash; legislative underpinning to a new requirement that residential houses be ring-fenced for individual buyers &ndash; almost 16,000 units restricted to single purchasers or social and affordable housing by mid-May as a result of restrictions on permissions, with legislative provision for this 'owner occupier guarantee' incorporated in housing strategies and development plans going forward;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; measures to increase construction sector capacity, including greater investment to increase the availability of apprenticeships and training, international recruitment initiatives and the new 'Future Building' initiative to spearhead activation and recruitment for the sector; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a number of significant measures to accelerate research and innovation in the sector, including Enterprise Ireland's new Built to Innovate Fund, a &euro;5 million investment for the establishment of a new Construction Technology Centre, and a new Modern Methods of Construction Demonstration Park, which will focus on increasing specialised training capacity and allow us to better respond to skills gaps in the construction sector; and <\/blockquote>&mdash; while very significant global and external challenges have emerged since the Housing for All strategy was published in September 2021, the Government remains focused on achieving the targets set out therein, and as committed to last year, when the Housing for All strategy was launched, the Government is currently reviewing and updating the actions in the plan which will be published in the coming weeks, this will allow the Government to respond to these challenges and redouble the focus on prioritising measures to activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>The Minister will close the second part of this debate.  Ours is a busy Department and its Minister and two Minsters of State share duties, as is common.  I am sure the Deputies will accept that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600010#H00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776420,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Under fierce pressure from below, the Government is implementing a temporary ban on evictions.  That is interesting because we were previously told that a ban on evictions would be unconstitutional.  Then Covid came and, under pressure, the Government brought in a ban.  It said there were exceptional circumstances and, due to the restrictions on movement for public health reasons, it was necessary to bring it in.  Now we have another temporary ban on evictions and the Government is saying it can get away with it constitutionally because it is only of a short duration.  The key argument for the ban on evictions is that it is a public good.  It is in the public interest and the public interest overrides the sectional interests of landlords and their rights.  That is a very strong argument for why a ban on evictions could and should be longer than five months.  It is a very strong argument for why a ban on evictions should be for the duration of the housing emergency or the housing crisis we have in this country.  I am glad the pressure from below has forced the Government into taking this step, but I point out the timidity of the Government on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the legislation on the ban that will be debated later, the only point I will make is that there has to be an explicit protection for people who can show an inability to pay their rent in full.  I gave the Taoiseach an example last week of a mother with young children who is faced with a choice between heating, eating or paying her full rent.  She might decide to pay half the rent or two thirds of the rent for the winter months to prioritise her kids and their welfare.  Under the legislation as formulated by the Government, that woman could receive a notice to quit.  She would have the right to go to the WRC but there would not be a guarantee that she would win her case - apologies, I meant the Residential Tenancies Board.  I have the WRC on my mind today because the Debenhams workers are in there this morning.  That woman should be given such a guarantee.  To that end, we have submitted amendments to the legislation and I hope those amendments are passed.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a couple of comments on the situation with the Ukrainian refugees and the housing crisis.  This has been commented on quite a bit on national radio this morning.  The Government and the State have let down the victims of this country's housing crisis.  There are nearly 11,000 people in emergency accommodation.  It is often wrongly described as us having 11,000 homeless.  That is not correct.  There are 11,000 people in emergency accommodation but there are tens of thousands of others who are homeless.  That 11,000 figure does not include rough sleepers or people in women's refuges.  It does not include the huge numbers of people who are couch surfing at the moment, or others.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say the State has made some significant efforts around accommodation for Ukrainian refugees, but the key point is the Government and the State are letting down Ukrainian refugees as well.  Last weekend, 43 were turned away because of a lack of beds while 35 were forced to sleep at Dublin Airport.  The T&aacute;naiste has said there will be no guarantee of housing for people who come in future.  People can still come but there will be no guarantee in that regard.  They are being let down by the Government and the State.  There was a very positive and broad welcome for Ukrainian refugees from the Irish people when they began arriving at the end of February and at the start of March.  I believe that sentiment still exists and is strong within society.  We saw a brilliant example of that recently in Killarney.  Ukrainian refugee families were told at very short notice - 48 hours - that they would be shipped up the west coast to County Mayo.  These were people who had kids in school.  Some of them were kids in school.  They were people who had jobs and good connections in the local community.  The local community came out and protested alongside them, highlighted the case alongside them and spoke out.  Real congratulations are due to that community.  It shows some of the best sentiments within our society.<\/p>  <p>  It is also the case that the failure of the Government and the State to provide housing for all has created a significant amount of discontent, anger and resentment in our society.  Many of those who feel that discontent, anger and resentment correctly blame this Government.  They know it is the Minister's failure and the failure of the Government.  It has created this crisis.  One of the Minister of State's partners in government, Fine Gael, has held the reins for nearly 12 years now, although to listen to its members sometimes you would think they were grappling with a crisis they inherited a couple of months ago.  Fianna F&aacute;il has either participated directly in Governments or kept Governments in power, de facto supporting their policies, for a period of nearly seven years now.  Those people are correct and they are right to blame the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, some of the people who feel that discontent, anger and resentment blame refugees for their plight.  If anything, that sentiment is on the increase within society at the moment.  To be clear on what I am saying here, Government policy and the Government's failure have created a situation that is lending itself to an increase in tensions between the victims of the housing crisis on the one hand and the victims of Putin's war on the other.  All those on the ground know that to be the case and that I am speaking some truth about this.  For many reasons, but now for this reason as well, it is urgent that we have a genuine policy of housing for all in Irish society.   The Government has been trying to fix this within the framework of the market for years now.  It has not worked, it is not working and it is not going to work.  That is why we need to break with the policies of the market.<\/p> <p>This is why we need an alternative approach.  I support the proposal in this motion.  It is an important proposal for the establishment of a State construction company.  If one looks at the local authority housing estates in Cork city such as Ballyphehane, Garranabraher or Knocknaheeny, there are many successes there.  Yes, there are some issues but there are many successes without a doubt.  This was public housing.  The role of the Cork City Council building unit, which is long since dismantled, was an important part of that.  The establishment of a State construction company is an important proposal.  I suggest that such a company should not have to compete with the private sector.  The private sector should be taken into public ownership, ending the marketplace solutions, and be integrated into such a State construction company.  For example, the largest construction company in the State, SISK, employs 2,000 workers.  It made &euro;23.3 million profit last year.  It was tasked by the Minister of State's Government with building many of the social housing houses that are part of the Government's target.  What did SISK do just a matter of months ago?  It threatened to pull out of building the social houses unless it got increased payments from the State.  What is that?  Let us call it by its right name.  At a time when we have 11,000 families in emergency accommodation, that is blackmail.  It is a threat and it is sabotage.  SISK's counterargument would be that there is construction inflation and if they are not compensated their profit margins will be cut and they might even be wiped out.  That is not an argument for stopping the building of social housing.  That is an argument for having not-for-profit construction and for nationalising that company.  While we are at it, we should nationalise all of the major construction companies and integrate them into a State construction company.  This includes BAM, John Paul, PJ Hegarty, and others.<\/p> <p> I also want to make some points about the defective block levy.  It should not be a tax on the product.  It should be a tax on the profits and it should be far higher than the tax that was levied on the blocks.  The construction industry, the banks, the insurers and the suppliers are the ones who should be taxed from their profits.  Of course they have threatened to pass this on as well.  Once again, one cannot control what one does not own.  If we are going to put all of our resources at the point of attack and go to war on this issue genuinely to build housing for all, for the victims of Ireland's housing crisis and for the victims of Putin's war, those are the kinds of anticapitalist and socialist measures that now need to be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600011#J00100","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666777020,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit for tabling this very positive motion and for allowing us to support it in the debate today.<\/p>  <p>  I will start by calling out the increasing dishonesty around Government discourse on housing.  We have heard many of the untruths here again today.  We are told repeatedly by the Government that we will see an expenditure of &euro;4 billion annually for tackling the housing crisis.  I have recent figures from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage which confirm that first, direct State capital investment under delivering social and affordable housing is just about &euro;1.8 billion for last year, this year and next year.  Even when one adds in approved housing bodies' borrowings and expenditure and the Land Development Agency figures for last year and this year we will not even reach &euro;2.4 billion.  I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, that this means if the Government is to reach that &euro;20 billion target that he stated here today, the Government must spend &euro;5 billion next year, the year after, and the year after that.  This is something that the Government neither intends nor has the capacity to do.<\/p>  <p>  We also hear regularly that the State is the largest developer.  This is also not true.  In fact, last year of the 24,000 new homes delivered the State was only directly responsible for the delivery of 1,000 of those, which is 4%.  How does 4% equate to being the largest developer in a market?  We hear about the largest social housing programme in the history of the State.  This is not true.  The Government's targets are lower than the original Fine Gael development plan, and for three years in a row the Government has not even been meeting those, as will be confirmed at the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that social housing need is falling.  This is not true.  If one goes to any local authority and asks for their gross social housing need report we can see that social housing need is increasing.  The Government is concealing almost half of all social housing need by taking HAP or RAS tenants off the list.  I believe this is deeply dishonest.  We hear that this is the Government of home ownership.  Let me tell the Minister of State that the more house prices rise the less people can afford to buy them.  It is a very simple law of economics and maths.  Everything this Government is doing is pushing up house prices: the help-to-buy scheme; the shared equity loan; and the enthusiastic welcome, particularly from Fianna F&aacute;il, for the very high-risk recent changes to mortgage lending rules by the Central Bank.  These actually all show that house ownership is going to be increasingly difficult under this Government in the time ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest untruth is that the plan is working.  How can the Minister of State say halfway through his term of office that the plan is working when house prices are higher than ever before, rents are higher than ever before and homelessness is higher than it has ever been before?  Yes, commencements are up, which is good, but they are only back at 2009 levels and we had a housing crisis then.  Yes, planning permissions are up but people cannot live in a planning permission if those planning permissions are not commenced.  In fact, contrary to what has been said, the Government housing policy is not only not tackling this crisis, it is making it worse.<\/p>  <p>  Later today we will discuss an emergency winter ban on evictions, which is something many of us in the Opposition have called for before.  This is evidence of the Government's failure.  It is a demonstration that the Government housing policies are not working.<\/p>  <p>  As we have said over and over again, there is an alternative.  We need about 40,000 new homes a year and half of those, which is 20,000, should be public homes, with increased social housing delivery and thousands of affordable homes delivered at a genuinely affordable prices to rent or buy.  We need to be bringing some 4,000 vacant and derelict homes back into active use as part of that 20,000 homes every year.  It is quicker, cheaper and it is better for the environment.  We need to embrace the new high-quality, timber-based products that have been developed here and we must have at least 1,000 zero-carbon timber frame and timber product homes annually.<\/p>  <p>  We also need more action to protect renters.  This winter eviction ban, while urgent and necessary, does not tackle the sky-high rents and it does not tackle insecurity of tenure.  This is why we continue to argue for a three-year ban on rent increases, for real refundable tax credits to put a months&rsquo; rent back into every renter's pocket, and real security of tenure.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to homelessness, other Deputies have mentioned Tathony House.  There is a very simple solution.  In fact, the local authority can buy it.  The local authority can combine social housing funding and cost-rental funding so those tenants who to date were not eligible for social housing could become cost renters.  The building could be bought by an approved housing body or it could be bought by a local authority.  There is no legal or funding impediment as to why, subject to structural condition of the building, the building could not be bought.  In fact, if this Government was serious about preventing homelessness the Minister of State would be calling for such a course of action today.  I urge people to support the residents' protest at Wood quay on Saturday.<\/p>  <p>  Crucially, we need a referendum to enshrine the right to housing under the Constitution.  We are all waiting eagerly to see the Government's response to the commission later on.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the Government is not listening.  The Government is not listening to the Opposition but I believe that it is going to have to start listening to the people.  All throughout November there will be public meetings in the four local authorities in Dublin organised by Raise the Roof.  The cost of living coalition has mobilisation organised for 12 November.  Raise the Roof will be organising a major march and concert on 26 November.  The Minister of State can either listen to us or listen to the people, but the longer he delays the worse it is going to get.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in is more than happy to support the motion before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600012#K00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1666777020,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Despite angry protests from the Opposition and from homeowners who are in the Public Gallery today, the Government rammed through legislation last July on defective concrete block homes.  The Government said it was doing this because it wanted to get on urgently with introducing a scheme that could work for the families.  Today I put it to the Minister of State that some 500 home-owning families are stuck in stage 1.  They cannot get access to financial supports.  They are stuck in dangerous homes.  In some cases these homes are just not fit for human habitation.  If the Minister of State could see them himself there is no way he would expect any family to live in some of these homes.  There is a real sense of abandonment.  There is a sense that the Government has pulled off a con and that they told the rest of the country that the protests and the stories that we hear, that cause us so much concern, are all sorted now, that the Government signed the cheques and it is all okay.  It is far from okay.  There are huge numbers of families, from Donegal right down the west coast, who are trapped in despair.  We must remember that it is almost three years ago that the Minister announced the first scheme.  This became a discredited scheme, which was the so-called \"90-10\" scheme.  It dragged on and on.  Then there was this new scheme, which is very limited also.

How can he force families to remain in those homes this winter?  Why is he not helping them find temporary alternative accommodation and paying for it?  Do they have to pay for a mortgage and find temporary accommodation which is just not there?  Why is he not looking at high-quality modular housing?  These things pit one set of people against another and it is wrong.  There are solutions for everybody but the Minister of State is making a hames of the whole lot.

By every metric the Housing for All strategy is failing.  In Dublin 15, the housing crisis is at its worst ever.  In excess of 88 families currently face a notice to quit, an increase of more than 50 in a little over three months.  Some are relieved there has been a stay of execution, but for some the ban has come too late and they face a dire situation, particularly those who are overholding.  They listen to the news every day and hear there is nothing out there to rent, and they have witnessed over the weekend Ukrainian citizens and others seeking international protection being told they have nowhere to go and to sleep on the streets.  That is despite the promises from Government that there would be accommodation.  It is shocking.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach last week about emergency legislation to put to use on a temporary basis land that is owned by local authorities but zoned other than residential, such as GE or HT, that is close to other homes and services and that can be brought into force quickly.

In a few short months, there is an opportunity to give people hope.   We and the people need to hear from the Minister of State.

It is timely we are having this conversation because on Monday my colleague, Councillor Noel Connolly, brought a motion to Kildare County Council seeking the establishment of a dereliction task force.  The meeting was told the council is in the process of setting up a town regeneration team, which it is hoped will make some effort to address the blight of dereliction that is rampant in south Kildare and the Portarlington area of Laois and Offaly.  It needs an urgent and consistent approach.  If we are to make any headway, we need a carrot-and-stick approach.  We need to encourage property owners to bring these properties back into use or transfer ownership to someone who will.  They need better support but we need to collect levies.

At the top of Main Street in Rathangan the Office of Public Works, OPW, owns a large building that has been derelict for decades.In Newbridge we have O'Modhrain Hall, another building that has been derelict for decades.  This building was held in trust for the people of Newbridge to support cultural, music and Irish language purposes.  It has recently been sold and there is still no word on the<i>cy-pr&eacute;s<\/i>scheme which will decide how the proceeds of the sale are distributed.  I ask the Minister of State to use his influence to see if the O'Modhrain Hall trust has been registered as a charity and when a decision will be made on the proceeds.<\/p><p>I would like to challenge the narrative being put forward by neo-Nazi groups who have raised their ugly head recently to sow dissent.  They maintain that the housing crisis is being caused by migrants, which is not true; by people seeking international protection, which is not true; or by people on social welfare, which is again not true.  We have a housing crisis because of deliberate Government policy that favours funds over families and treats the roofs over people's heads as a commodity.  It has to stop.  Sinn F&eacute;in in Government will deliver change, a referendum on the right to housing, social and affordable housing and everything necessary to reverse the disastrous policies of this Government, which has presided over a 175% increase in homelessness.  It is a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600013#L00300","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1666777620,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit for the opportunity to speak and for bringing forward the motion.

The Minister of State will know the Green Party did not exactly leave the housing market in decent shape when it last exited Government, so it shares some of that responsibility.

They are seeking something very basic: security and somewhere to live, raise their family and be able to shut the door in the evening and know they can have peace and quiet.  It is chaotic to be on a notice to quit.  It is chaotic for your children if you are not able to tell them where they will be living in a couple of months.   It messes with your mental health in a way I do not think we will understand for many years.  It destroys families.  Government policy has brought us here.

Each week we hear the news from the Government that local authorities are meeting their targets, so you might think building enough social and affordable housing to meet the need is happening, but it is not.  Not one local authority that has been in says that if they meet all targets on social, affordable and cost rentals, that list will not rise.  Not alone should we be stopping the lists from rising, we should be trying to reduce the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Using Cork City Council as an example, I will go through a few numbers.  That council's target for affordable housing each year is 78 homes.  The council has estimated that 3,294 families will not qualify for either a mortgage or social housing in the next five years.  How in the name of God does the Minister of State and Government think delivering 78 affordable houses will solve that crisis?  Cork City Council thinks it will exceed its social housing targets, which sounds positive, and build 2,134 homes, but it estimates that 2,688 households will join the waiting list in the same period.  To make it simple, that means the council's targets, when they are met, will leave it with 500 more families on the housing list than it had before it met any targets.  We are talking about thousands of children being detrimentally affected.<\/p> <p>Cork City Council needs to build more, but its targets need to be higher.  These are Government targets.  It is setting targets that are too low and not ambitious enough.

I have not seen the housing crisis as bad as it is now in Galway city in a very long time.  We are having a crisis in all the different strands relating to housing.  We are not seeing supply come on stream.  People who have been on the housing waiting list for 15 years have had no offer of accommodation.  There is nowhere to rent.  If the Minister of State went on <i>daft.ie<\/i>today to see what he could rent in Galway city, he would find nothing but if he went on a short-term let website to see what he could rent for a few nights in Galway city at huge cost, he would find a lot of places.  That is what is wrong in our rental crisis.  On top of that, those who have received notice to quit and have nowhere to go have nowhere to go because there is also a crisis in emergency accommodation.  It is not good enough for us to ask people to sleep on their friends' couch or live in the spare room or sitting room of their parents' house, as a family with three children.

There were media reports yesterday that there are 30 students in Galway who have been unable to get to their lectures in NUIG on time because a few Government crises have come together: accommodation and transport.  The buses that are supposed to be bringing these students in on time are not doing that.  It is affecting everyone in Galway: those who have literally nowhere to go; the students who are trying to learn; and everyone in between who is trying to support these families.

One year on from the publication of Housing for All, the Government's signature plan is failing and failing abjectly.  The Minister of State might think that as an Opposition Member that I would take some pleasure in reminding the Government of that, but I do not, because we need a plan that works.  We need a housing plan for all but this is not it.  I take no pleasure in saying that because housing is the single biggest social and, arguably, economic issue facing this country.  It is the number one issue based on the contacts from my constituents to my office, at my clinics or when I speak to those I represent on the streets of Louth and east Meath.  The way we as a State approach the basic fundamental question of housing has changed dramatically in the past 25 years.  When I first became a public representative, which I think was around the same time as the Minister of State, local authorities were more or less building a sufficient number of homes to meet demand.  That is not to say that there not problems.  There certainly were at back in the 1990s.  At that time it meant that we, as elected representatives, worked with housing officers in local authorities to make the case for our constituents who were eligible for social housing to have them housed in a timely period.  More often than not, those reasonable expectations were met.  The local authority provided them with the support they needed and the State provided the local authorities with the support they needed, by and large.<\/p>  <p>  We had some agency, as public representatives, to advocate with and on behalf of our constituents, but now, with the dreadfully low level of social and affordable homes available, constituents of mine have been reduced to coming into my office or stopping me on the street and asking, for example, for references for private landlords for properties they will probably never be able to rent.  They feel they have no agency.  They have been on a housing list for up to 12 years.  I feel, as a public representative of 23 years' standing, that I have no agency with the local authority.  We are having meetings with housing officers in local authorities and making cases to them for properties that simply do not exist and they are not going to exist this time next year and they are not going to exist in two years' time either.  This is becoming increasingly difficult.<\/p>  <p>  All this changed in the early- or mid-2000s with the financialisaton of our housing model.  Despite what the spin attached to Housing for All claims, the reality is that not much will change during this Administration's time in office.  There is an over-reliance on private developers to address the housing crisis and piecemeal tax breaks for landlords and renters that fail to understand the extent and depth and nature of the problem, while all the time maintaining the destructive speculative model that is undermining the fabric of our society and our economy.  We do not have a functioning housing system.  A working system would not see more than 11,000 people homeless, and that is an underestimation of the real figures.  A system that works would not see hundreds of people queuing around corners, waiting to view properties they will never be able to rent and certainly never be able to buy.  Yes, we need an eviction ban, a three-year rent freeze and to adjust HAP limits throughout the State.  Yes, we need to build more private homes in sustainable communities and get our act together to deal finally and fundamentally with dereliction and vacancy to bring homes back into use.  Yes, we need to ensure income limits for public housing are increased to &euro;40,000, and we fundamentally need to tackle hoarding of land that is ripe and ready for housing developments with the kind of penal taxes and disincentives we see applied right across western European economies.  The systemic solution is staring us all in the face: the need to build more social and affordable homes - end of story.  We also need to identify and acknowledge the fact our broken system has an extreme over-reliance on State subsidies for private rental accommodation to provide social housing through current expenditure programmes like HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and social leasing.  What started out as short-term schemes, in some cases specialised support schemes, have now become a deeply embedded feature of our social housing system.<\/p>  <p>  Our ultimate goal should be to phase out those kinds of systems and ensure systems such as HAP and RAS are only used as short-term measures until a person or family with an identified housing need is permanently housed in public owned buildings or by approved housing bodies.  We need to allocate, as the Labour Party has proposed in its alternative budget this year, an additional &euro;1.43 billion in capital for the delivery of housing in 2023.  In this year's budget we would have invested enough to deliver 20,000 social and affordable homes in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  According to revised estimates, the target for social housing units through old build programmes in 2022, was 9,000 homes.  These targets are unlikely to be met.  Approved housing bodies were this year to deliver 3,850 homes, with 400 through the capital assistance scheme and the remainder through the capital advanced leasing facility.  At least another 100 were to come through the national regeneration programme.  The balance of approximately 5,050 homes would come from the local authority housing budget of &euro;1.238 billion according to the Government plan.  The proposed build programme under Housing for All in 2023 is to deliver 9,100 social homes in all.  That is nowhere near sufficient given the needs and targets this year, targets that will not be met in any case.<\/p>  <p>As provided for in our costed alternative budget, we would provide an additional &euro;835 million in funding from excess corporation tax receipts to build an extra 2,900 local authority homes next year on publicly owned land.<\/p> <p> We propose to more than double the annual delivery of cost-rental and affordable housing.  These two streams would ensure that 4,000 affordable-purchase homes and 4,000 cost-rental homes would be delivered in 2023, partially funded through the scaling down of the help-to-buy scheme and the first-home shared equity scheme.  I remind both the Minister and Minister of State of the reality of the deadweight nature of these schemes, as enunciated by the ESRI and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the inflationary effect on the cost of purchases by first-time buyers.<\/p> <p> As noted by previous speakers, the answer to our housing crisis is staring us in the face.  It is fundamentally about scaling up social and affordable housing provision.  In reality, Housing for All does not come anywhere close to meeting the demand that exists and that we will face in the future.  There needs to be a refocusing and a genuine national effort regarding social and affordable housing.  It is on this that the Minister will be judged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600014#M00300","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Czech Delegation","time":1666778820,"counter":50,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600015#N00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1666778820,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I ask Members to join me in welcoming the Czech delegation in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, led by Mr. Stanislav Blaha and accompanied by the Czech ambassador, H.E.

There is a sense that one's life is being uprooted.  Often people in these circumstances talk about how the increased anxiety affects their children.  They might tell you about how a child is doing well in school after having overcome several challenges in the preceding few years and that they are deeply worried that a notice to quit and an eviction will uproot that child just as things settle.  I am referring to the families in luckier situations.  Children with significant learning difficulties or challenges owing to their not receiving the mental health or disability supports they need face major anxiety and distress when an eviction notice is issued.<\/p>  <p>  I thank People Before Profit for tabling the motion.  When we hear the response of the Government to it, it seems to us that it is not listening or responding to the points made by us this morning.  There has been no engagement.  The Government displayed genuine arrogance by not responding and by listing off things it is doing that are part reality but also part fiction.  As said before, the figure of &euro;4 billion for capital expenditure on housing is not correct.  Not only is it not correct but the Government is actually 30% behind in its capital expenditure on housing right now, according to its own figures published in the September Fiscal Monitor.  How is it possible, in the depth of the crisis we have, that it is 30% behind in its capital expenditure?  It is scandalous given the considerable hardship that people are going through.<\/p>  <p>  You would swear from listening to the Government's response that it is not aware that we have the highest-ever rents in the country.  New rents increased by 9% in the past year.  We have the highest-ever house prices.  They have increased by 12% in the past year.  We have the highest-ever number of people living in emergency accommodation because they have become homeless.  In this regard, there has been an increase of 30% in the past year.  The number of children living in emergency accommodation has increased by 47% in the past 12 months.  There has been no mention of that in the response by the Government, which denies the reality of what is going on and keeps telling us things are getting better.  There has been no mention by the Government of generations stuck at home or the huge number of people who are now living in their parents' homes against their wishes.  The number of people between 25 and 34 who own a home collapsed from 60% to 27% between 2004 and 2019.  I suspect this proportion has decreased further in the past couple of years.  The Government is oblivious to the impact this is having on people in terms of their not being able to get on with their lives or become independent, combined with the anxiety and impacts on mental health and well-being.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time as this is happening, over &euro;1 billion in public money is going towards the HAP, RAS and long-term leasing, which is pushing up rents and not directly increasing supply.  The profits of those who are exploiting the housing crisis are soaring.  Institutional housing investors' profits nearly doubled last year.  The amount of effective tax they paid collapsed from 17.9% to just 5.9% last year as their profits soared.  The profits of one of the largest house builders in the country, Cairn Homes, jumped by 84% in the first half of this year.  While people are massively impacted by the housing disaster, the profits of those benefiting from it are going through the roof.  The Government is in denial about the scale of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  I will list a few things the Government could and should do now to address the crisis.  We need to increase the delivery of social and affordable homes.  We need 20,000 affordable cost-rental and social homes to be delivered per year.  Incidentally, this is what the Minister promised during the last election campaign but which he has failed to achieve.  We need to tackle vacancy and dereliction.  Consider the Government's proposals in this regard.  Fine Gael promised a tax on vacant properties as far back as 2017 but never did anything about it.  We finally have a 0.3% tax on vacancy coming in but this is designed to fail.  It will not have the desired effect.  We need a strong, effective and punitive tax to get the more than 100,000 vacant homes back into use.<\/p>  <p>  We also need measures to penalise developers for slow build-out and for sitting on planning permissions.  There is a huge number of planning permissions in the system now for projects that are not getting built out.  Where there are larger schemes, there is drip-feeding in an effort to control prices.  At the same time, the profits of the larger developers responsible for the slow build-out and the drip-feeding of homes are soaring.  We need this to be addressed.  We need more support to get more small and medium builders back building, allowing them to compete with the larger developers.  We need to strengthen the capacity of the not-for-profit sector and local authorities to build more homes.  Recently at meetings of the housing committee, representatives of some of the local authorities have said that if they had better resources in terms of staff, they would be able to do more to deliver affordable cost-rental and social homes.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to tackle vested interests that are making huge profits from the housing crisis.  Land costs comprise a significant cost associated with new housing.  Let me give an example from my constituency that the Minister and others will be aware of, namely a very successful housing development built 100 years ago in Marino in my constituency.  The land for the development was bought for less than &pound;5,000; it was bought for &pound;4,974.  I realise that was 100 years ago, which is a long time ago, but when the sum is adjusted for inflation, it equates to about &euro;350,000 today.  The land cost when the Marino development was built out was 1.5% of the overall cost.  Now the land cost is about 16% of the total cost of a development.  One can see that if land costs were tackled by the Government &ndash; they have not been &ndash; it would contribute towards bringing costs down and making homes more affordable.  It would reduce the cost of delivering social and affordable homes and make it more feasible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600015#N00700","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1666779420,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I am delighted the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is here to listen to us.  I am not going to tell him what is wrong, because I think he knows himself what is wrong.  There is no point in me repeating what everyone else says.  What we must do is look at a few issues and see how we can improve on delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The very first issue I will address is the planning system.  I give the Minister the example of Galway County Council, which has just completed a county development plan.  The regulator put in recommendations that were accepted and signed off by the Minister.  One of them was not to allow the zoning of land at Woodlawn train station where we can build residential houses.  The reason is that there is no sewerage facility.  If we do not zone the land, we are going nowhere.<\/p>  <p>  The limiting of the amount of land zoned for R1 is resulting in the price going up.  Why is there such a policy?  If we have more land that people are willing to make available, and it is zoned R1 then we would perhaps get some houses built at a reasonable price because there would be competition in the market for the land.<\/p>  <p>  I am coming at this from the point of view of what I see on the ground.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is in place to deal with vacant properties.  I have one constituent who made an application to Galway County Council in August yet the property has still not been inspected.  He has had to go ahead and build out what he is doing at the risk of losing the grant.  Why is that the case?  It is because the council does not have the resources to carry out the inspections.  I know the Minister is giving each local authority &euro;60,000 each to put an inspector in place, but that will not solve the problem.  When the Minister issues his directive next week or whenever else for rural areas, we will have a significant volume of applications, as people are willing to take it up, but there is a logjam due to inspections not taking place.  That is what is happening on the ground.  Putting an engineer into the system is not what is needed.  We need a full team in every local authority to deal with bringing vacant properties back into use.  We must be able to deal in a very economical and quick way with the applications that come in.  We have people who are willing to do something for themselves and the Minister has put a scheme in place, so let us resource the scheme properly so that it can function.  Let it not be like the retrofitting scheme, which is an abject failure at this stage because only 59 houses have been retrofitted since the scheme was announced last spring.  We must learn that there is no point in announcing something and saying we are putting money into it unless we put the resources in place to make it happen.  What is happening right now is that the local authorities are being blamed because they are not carrying out the inspections.  To be honest, these are the type of issues that gall me when I see them happening because it is not doing anything for the public sentiment for the Government or politicians.<\/p>  <p>  The towns and villages that do not have wastewater treatment plants are currently frozen out of the planning process.  In my parish, there is a fine track of land right in the centre of the village of Corrofin that could accommodate retail and up to perhaps 100 residential units, but Galway County Council cannot give planning permission, and neither will An Bord Plean&aacute;la because a previous decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2007 stated that any further development in this village is premature pending the installation of a municipal wastewater treatment plant.  We have a situation where the numbers in the schools in the parish are beginning to reduce because we cannot get people into the villages.  We have six housing estates in the village and they all have private wastewater treatment plants.  They need to be connected to the wastewater treatment system.  There is a river running through the village which is part of the tributary into the Corrib.  In effect, we have an environmental time bomb.  One of these days we will see fish with their bellies up in the water and the river full of sewage.  We must get real about this.  These are not insurmountable issues.  All that is wrong is that Irish Water does not seem to have any interest in the towns and villages that can deliver houses.  People will build the houses and they will not be looking for State intervention to build them.  The houses will be built at a lower cost and young families will buy them and move into them, rather than putting them all into the cities.  We must think rationally about the issue.  I am giving Corrofin as an example, but I could give the Minister 20 more, such as Abbeyknockmoy, Craughwell, Laban and Ardrahan.  It is not possible to build any houses in these towns in my constituency all around Galway.  People have sought planning permission and they have been refused.<\/p>  <p>  On the other side of the coin, if somebody wants to build in a rural area, he or she is being told that the council has to watch out for linear development.  If there are four houses in a row, planning permission will not be given for a fifth one.  Another issue that comes up is an over-intensification of septic tanks.  These are the type of issues that are driving people mad.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, we now have a situation where the National Roads Authority, NRA, is the agency dictating who builds what, where and when, because it is restricting every road in the country that it can in order that people will not get to build on them.  This is what is happening.  Farmers' sons and daughters cannot build on their own farms.  It is wrong and we must put it right.  We have a crisis at the moment.  We must stop talking about all the money that we are putting into it; the focus must be on what is coming out of it.  Where are the houses being built and how quickly are they being built?  Nobody knows anything about the shared equity scheme in Galway.  It is supposed to be the greatest panacea to solve problems, but we have not seen it.  What I am saying is that announcements are being made about funding, but nothing is happening.  At the end of the day, we are just not doing it right.<\/p>  <p>  We also have a situation whereby the private sector is not functioning either.  It is dysfunctional.  The cost of building houses is so high that builders cannot get people to buy them, yet the Minister came along and tried to put a further levy on construction materials at a time when it is ridiculous.  It is time to take off the gloves and to get at this at the level it is at.  Currently, in the private sector we have countless private landlords, who are selling up.  In fact, there are 500 houses for sale in Galway and the tenants are local authority tenants on housing assistance payment, HAP, schemes.  The private landlords are selling up.  I declare a vested interest in that I am a private landlord.  People are not interested in renting a property any more because there is too much hassle with it, and they are being demonised for having a rental property.  If someone is on a HAP scheme for instance, if the tenant refuses to pay the rent, then the landlord does not get paid either and the State might have a free run for perhaps two years until the person can be removed from the house.  There are a lot of ills, and we must start to rectify them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600016#O00100","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1666779420,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Like I always do, I want to declare an interest in all aspects of this issue that I am going to talk about.  Some 20,535 properties were built in 2020, less than a quarter of what was constructed during the height of the housing boom in 2006.  The national planning framework estimates that structural demands for new housing based on the demographics supplied is between 25,000 and 35,000 per year.  Rebuilding Ireland has failed to meet its annual target every year since it was implemented.  It was 41,000 units below its overall target.  Cumulative annual defects in the new building completions have amplified trends in rents, house prices and homelessness.  Supply-side constraints such as skilled labour shortages, rising costs of construction and excessive lead times are limiting the affordability of new dwellings.  The shift in demand for dwellings has caused both house prices and rents to increase substantially.  This surge in prices has made housing unaffordable for many, leading to a decline in homeownership rates from 78% in 2007 to 68.7% in 2020.  High demand and low supply have been long-term obstacles in the path to providing a stable housing market.  On the supply side, the most notable issues preventing affordable housing are the rising costs of construction, skilled labour shortages, poorly planned and executed Government housing policies and supply chain disruptions.  Ireland's housing problems are rooted in the high cost of construction, which has driven up sales and rental prices and they are compounded by a lack of supply and a growing population.<\/p> <p>It has become apparent that Rebuilding Ireland has failed in its objectives and that the past few years, under the rebranded Housing for All, have delivered little progress in providing a sufficient level of housing.<\/p> <p> The eviction ban, for example, will not result in an increase in the provision of housing for people.  It will not help any one person who is on the housing list in, say, County Kerry.  It will not provide a home for them, and it has to be knocked on the head in case people think it is a magic bullet that is going to be great.  People building houses on their own land should be encouraged, should nearly be given a medal, because if a young person wants to build a home on his or her own land, to hell with the crackpots, the objectors and the noodeenaws who do want not people to live on their own land.  Let them go away and whistle their ducks to water but let the person who wants to build a house on his or her own land do it.<\/p> <p> As for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it is a discredited organisation that is a shame in its existence.  It has held up building in this country for long enough and it is being shown up now for what it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600016#O00200","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666780020,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit for tabling the motion and giving us an opportunity to talk about these very serious issues that are neglected in the housing programme.  A week or so ago, Councillor Maura Healy-Rae tabled a motion in Kerry County Council asking how many vacant houses, voids, were in the county, and the number was 171.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister is in the Chamber because I want to put this to him straight.  The Government is boasting and blathering about the housing programme that it is responsible for.  Perhaps it is doing it somewhere else, but it is not doing it in Kerry or for the people of Kerry.  Perhaps Dublin is being looked after again.  When a house becomes void in Kerry, the housing section is told it has to bring it back to a standard whereby it has to be deep-retrofitted and everything else that goes with it, and it costs &euro;60,000 to &euro;70,000, yet the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in Dublin will give only &euro;11,000 towards the house.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister can shake his head but I am saying it here and it is on the record of the House.  If the house comes back into use after less than six years, the owner will get no bob at all.  There are 171 such houses in Kerry, and if the Minister says he is doing something about the housing market, I am asking him now to give money and sort this out.  Many of these houses have been void or vacant for years.  I can name a lot of them.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to raise the housing cap because it is not acceptable with the cost of living.  Moreover, the family income supplement, where it is included in their income, should be disregarded and I ask the Minister to do that.  Some single people and families have been on the list in Killarney and Kerry for 13 to 16 years.

One issue with much construction at the moment that would help businesspeople relates to the planning laws that need to be changed or amended to allow business owners to build accommodation for their staff, which would encourage their staff to stay within the business they are in and which would allow businesspeople to future-proof their business and build apartments or housing for their staff.  The current laws, however, mean that if they build housing for their staff, they have to give a certain amount back to social housing, which is causing a problem for some industries.<\/p>  <p>  One person is looking to build 20 apartments to house people within his business but he cannot do it under the planning laws because, given the location of the property, adjacent to his business, it would not do for social housing.  The company Eli Lilly is coming to Limerick and spending &euro;500 million on the start-up stage, which will end up with a total of &euro;1.3 billion invested in Limerick.  Its biggest issue, however, relates to housing and getting houses for people to work there, yet in Croom, I have 130 or 140 houses that could be built but that have been held up by Irish Water for the past two years.  Within ten minutes' drive of Limerick, I have 130 houses that, if built, would help the social housing aspect and the industry we want so badly within Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister look at amending the laws relating to businesses that want to provide housing for their own staff such that they will not have to give back to social housing?  That is the one thing I am asking.  Can they be amended to allow for businesses to build apartments, if they wish, for their staff only, without having to contribute to the social housing sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600017#P00700","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1666780020,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit-Solidarity for the detailed motion.  I have a difficulty with one issue, relating to the six months and the taking-over of houses, which I think needs a lot more thrashing out, but on a general level I support the motion.  The five-page response from the Government is nothing short of shocking.  When we look at the background to the motion and to the housing crisis, we have normalised homelessness.  When I go back to my hotel at night, I walk past people in the street and ask myself what I have become.  What have people become who are sitting there on one side of the little divide, having a drink and something to eat, while on the other side there is somebody on the ground in a sleeping bag?  What has happened to me as a human being and what has happened to those people?  That is something I have to fight with myself.  Nevertheless, in regard to Government policy, I have had the privilege, or the torture, or being a representative for a long time.  Over that time, I have watched the results of Government policy intensifying the housing crisis over and over.  We on this side of the House have repeatedly begged and appealed to the Government to call it a crisis and begin to deal with that, and that has not happened.<\/p><p>And so we are here today with a five-page response from the Government that does not put anything in context.  It does not deal with the gracious motion from People Before Profit-Solidarity that notes the background to it and highlights the positive aspect of the eviction legislation that is planned, even though it came only after sustained pressure.  The homelessness figures are 10,805, including 3,220 children.  As I have reiterated <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, surely there is something wrong with our policy when that is the level of visible homelessness we know about, not counting the hidden homelessness.  The question is what is wrong.  I go back to my experience as a councillor.  We stopped building public housing well before the war in Ukraine and the illegal invasion by Russia.  We stopped building houses in 2009, and then we copper-fastened that policy by saying the only game in town was the housing assistance payment, HAP, and people were taken off the waiting list.  Much of our energy and time as councillors was spent arguing with officials about whether people were on or off the list.  I was told I was telling lies, and I recall pointing out at the time that I was a lawyer, not a liar, although there is often a shady area between the two and I will be the first to say that.  That was the level of the engagement, rather than deciding that HAP would be the only game in town and that people would be taken off the list.<\/p><p>That was to be a temporary solution, although that is not what the legislation said.  It said a person was adequately housed if he or she was in a HAP apartment.  Some Opposition Deputies now who are behind that, along with Government Deputies, say it was never meant to be permanent but it absolutely was, and HAP is a fundamental part of the problem.  I ask the Minister please not to stand up and tell me he cannot get rid of HAP overnight &ndash; obviously, he cannot - but he has to acknowledge that the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government went down that road and the Minister is now in a position to make an announcement stating that this is not the correct way and that we need to phase it out and build public housing on public land.<\/p> <p>The snobbery and duplicity that is inherent in the talk about balancing communities is simply unacceptable.  I go back to the city council when its representatives were here reporting to the committee.  Let me just stay with Galway.  We have land in the docks run by a company on behalf of the people of Galway that is entirely answerable to itself, even though it is technically or theoretically owned by the city council.  Why that public land is not simply being used for public housing is beyond my comprehension.  I am told there is engagement with the Land Development Agency, LDA.  This should be public land for public housing.  We have land at Sandy Road.  It is public land and should be for public housing.  We have lots of other land although the council is now telling us there is no more land, but it has identified those sites.  If the Minister wants to make a difference, he should make an announcement that public land is for public housing.  Then, he should ask the LDA to give him a copy of the audit of all public land in the country.  the agency was supposed to have carried out that audit years ago but we are still waiting for it.<br\/><br\/>The background of the Simon Community report is worth looking at.  It does a snapshot every quarter of 16 study areas over three days.  This is its 27th snapshot.  It is worth looking at.  These are not my words.  There are no properties available in Galway city or the suburbs under any part of HAP or discretionary HAP.  There are no properties available whatsoever.  There has been a consistent rise in rents, which have gone off the deep end.  The latter is the case and yet we persist with a housing policy that is fundamentally flawed, notwithstanding the good parts the Minister zones in on sometimes.<br\/><br\/>Let me look at the Mazars report.  I read this into the record last night in the context of the help-to-buy scheme.  I only mention it again today because when the Minister of State was in the Chamber, he referred to this as a good.  On public money, Mazars tells us:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe scheme is poorly targeted with respect to incomes, location, house prices and ... socioeconomic factors.  As a result, it ... [is] socially regressive ... [it has] considerable deadweight ... and it is poorly aligned with spatial policy. <\/blockquote> <p>The report suggests that if we were to start now, it would not be a rational way to do things.  It is utterly condemnatory of the scheme.  More than one third of people already had the deposit; they did not need any help.  What we have done is help people buy houses costing up to &euro;500,000.  That is what the scheme is doing.  Consultants and various professionals, some of whom are in my own family, avail of the schemes, and fair play to them.  The problem is that the Government policy is a dead weight.  Does the Minister know what  Mazars said?  Scrap it, but do not scrap it now.  It is like the prayer to God that goes: &quot;Forgive me for sinning.  I am going to change, but just not now.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Mazars tells us that this is a terrible scheme but not to change it now.  Why does it say that?  Because it has become embedded in Government policy.  What is Government policy?  Feed the market on every single level across HAP, RAS and long-term leasing.  The Minister is shaking his head but the facts are there for him to see.  If a communication was issued to the markets to the effect that a home is sacred and is the most fundamental essential in a democracy for security, then the Minister would be sending a message.  Prices would have to come down and the Government would be right there in the middle of the market providing public housing.  We have to change the income limits.  All that has to be done.<br\/><br\/>I live in Galway city.  We cannot even meet the officials there.  Can the Minister imagine that?  Since the advent of Covid, we have to do everything by e-mail.  Covid has been a great excuse.  At one time, you could go with an applicant, reassure them and say, &quot;Do your time and you will eventually get a house&quot;.  That is gone by the board.  Now, people are told to go on the choice-based letting scheme.  Can you imagine telling someone in their 60s or 70s to go online, on a computer they have not got a clue about, and opt for choice-based letting?  They are on the list and have been since 2007.  I checked before I came here.  Surely, the homeless figures and the fact that no properties are available would tell the Minister that something is seriously wrong with the housing policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600017#P00800","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666780620,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues for tabling this motion.  I fully accept the bona fides of what is in the motion and of the Deputy Boyd Barrett's perspective.  I do not agree with everything in the motion, although there are parts with which I do agree.  I will say to Deputy Connolly that there is nothing in the five-page counter motion that is incorrect.  That is factual.  She does not have to agree with it all, and I respect that too.  However, this debate again shows the scale of the challenges we have in housing.<\/p>  <p>  I will put it in context if I may.  We have had ten or 12 years of significant undersupply of public social homes and no affordable homes to speak of at all.  We have got to turn that around.  We are not going to turn that around in a year or two years.  We have had one year of Housing for All.  I would say respectfully, to speak to what Deputy Connolly said, that this is true housing for all.  We will be putting in &euro;4.5 billion in 2023 and have put in more than &euro;4 billion this year. It is about actually building public housing and social homes.  I believe in social housing.  This year, we have targeted 9,000 new build social homes between local authorities and approved housing bodies.  That is really important.  I had the pleasure of meeting many people in Deputy Connolly's county, in Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s constituency and in the Acting Chairman's county of Wexford who are now getting those safe and secure for homes for life.  There is a good pipeline into next year.<\/p>  <p>  Of course there are challenges, and we were restricted.  That is a fact.  To be fair, Deputy Boyd Barrett recognised previously that we had two severe construction shutdowns in 2020 and 2021 that limited supply.  Even in those years, however,  if we take last year, on social housing alone, 9,183 social homes and just over 5,000 new builds were delivered.  That is not enough at all.  We will note this in the Deputy's motion as well.  Looking at the quarter 2 delivery figures, which I say to the House and to Deputy Boyd Barrett specifically, we will have very strong delivery on the social housing side in the last two quarters of this year.  Much of it is always back-ended to the last part of the year due to completions.<\/p>  <p>  I will address some of Deputy Connolly's comments for the record because I want to respond specifically to Galway.  It is about building the platform and putting in the foundations to deliver social homes at a scale we have not seen before, that is, 90,000 between now and 2030.  I respect Deputy Connolly's suggestion, and the policy her party has, about creating a State construction company and letting that company do all this building of public homes.  I would ask this question, however.  How long would it take to get that State construction company established and up and running run and to be effective?  How long would it take to get the people in to do the work, get the land and deliver those additional homes that we need?<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Connolly mentioned the LDA.  I fully agree with the concept of using idle State land to provide homes for our people.  That is actually what we are doing this year.  For the first time, the LDA has delivered homes.  I was in the homes in Mallow in County Cork this year.  We are breaking ground in Shanganagh Castle, which the Deputy knows very well, which will provide just over 600 affordable and social homes.  The St. Kevin's site in Cork will provide cost-rental, affordable purchase and social housing.  There will  be thousands more.  We have planning applications in through the LDA on State land for affordable and social homes for approximately 2,500 new properties.  Therefore, it is happening.  The overall target for delivery under Housing for All this year is 24,600.  The Deputy will say that is not enough, and it is not enough.  It is, however, about building that capacity of having the people to actually build the houses.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the levels and the numbers of people in construction pre pandemic versus what is there now, there are actually 20,000 more.  That is because the plan is giving confidence in the sector that there will be a safe, secure and stable housing market.  We must build that capacity up.  Thankfully, this year, it is projected from the data and research I have done that we will exceed the overall target.  We might not hit all the targets within it but we will exceed the overall target and deliver affordable purchase homes for the first time in a generation.  These homes start from &euro;166,000 in Lusk in my area to Kilcarbery in south Dublin and right the way across.  I have already approved 1,900 local authority-led and deliverable affordable homes through 30 schemes across the country through the affordable housing fund, and we are approving more and more.  That is with real money, with the State putting in that subvention and taking that equity piece to allow the low-income and middle-income earners to actually buy that home.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Canney mentioned the first home scheme, which I will address for the purpose of the record of the D&aacute;il.  People said they do not know about in Galway.  We have already had approximately 20 approvals of houses for people in a very short space of time in Galway county.  That is ramping up.  We had 600 approvals for real families and real people to buy real homes at an affordable rate.  These are people who were locked out of the market for years, many of whom were renting and who, if they could get a mortgage, would be paying much less.  I want those targeted supports in there because I believe in home ownership and in public housing.  We have seen a reduction in the numbers of people in social housing but not on social housing waiting lists.  It is not near enough, however.<\/p> <p>I want to address the issue of HAP that has been raised.  HAP is a support for approximately 60,000 households.  I am certain no one is suggesting that we flick the switch and turn off HAP overnight.  What I have done in the two years I have been Minister is reduce dependence on HAP, transferring people out of HAP and into permanent tenancies.  That involved about 4,000 households.  I am allowing for a lesser increase in HAP tenancies this year and next year because I want more people in permanent social homes.  What we have got to do is deliver them.  This year we will have significantly more new-build social homes than last year and than in decades.  We have to build on that again.  Next year we are targeting 29,000 and it moves on from there.  It is not going to be changed overnight.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of vacancy, by the end of this year I will have brought more than 7,500 vacant social homes back into use.  Our local authorities have to be quicker at tenanting and re-tenanting them and turning them around.  They do not all have to be deep retrofit, either, as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae suggested.  I want those homes back in safe good use and we are doing it.  That is actually happening.<br\/><br\/>When I look at the measures in the motion, with the exception of the commentary that led into the motion, there are elements that I would completely agree with.  I want to use my opportunity here today to address in particular the notices to quit with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.  For RAS and HAP tenants, I have told every single local authority, in person with their directors of services for housing and their chief executives over a housing summit last Thursday week and again in writing, that for any HAP or RAS tenant who is issued a notice to quit, the local authority should buy the home, end of story, no conditions.  They do not need to come back to me to ask for it.  Since then, and I think the Deputy questioned the Taoiseach on this last week as well, we have about 650 properties, and I hope to get more.  The local authorities have been told very clearly they are to do it.  If anyone comes across instances where that is not happening - there are one or two exceptions such as criminal antisocial behaviour or something like that.  That is fine; we would all agree on that.  I want that done as a measure to help people not fall into homelessness as we are building up our supply.  It also increases the public housing stock that we have.  I have been very clear about it.  I am not putting any further conditions on it.  I want them to do it.  I want to deliver affordable housing, which we are doing.<br\/><br\/>Cost-rental did not exist in this country 12 months ago.  We legislated for it in the Affordable Housing Act, which the Deputy, as is his right, opposed.  We legislated for a national cost-rental scheme for the first time.  We have already got hundreds of tenancies in place in that scheme and I want hundreds and thousands more of them.  It is extremely popular.  Every single cost-rental scheme that has been advertised has been oversubscribed.  I cannot deliver 10,000 cost rental units overnight.  The Deputy knows that and, in fairness, the general public knows it too.  It is about building the capacity and having a robust plan that is fully funding and is going to be able to drive this development, both public and private.<br\/><br\/>In the area of vacancy, in the budget and more recently I announced the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe vacancy grants.  We have vacant and derelict homes right across the country.  It is expanded into the rural areas from 1 November.  I have announced that, in answer to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  That is done.  The grants are &euro;30,000 for a vacant home and &euro;50,000 for a derelict home.  Since August, there have been over 400 applications to that scheme by people who want to buy a home and use that money to affray the cost of renovating it.  We are also expanding the buy and renew, which is local authorities buying vacant and derelict homes and doing them up, and bringing them back into public use.  That is happening through repair and lease really well in some counties.  Other counties need to be supported to do more.  In Waterford and Limerick there is some really good work in conversion of old commercial buildings where I have set aside the planning, by the way, for conversion from commercial to residential.  There are many things happening and momentum is building around it.  Is it all done in one year?  Of course it is not.  No one would suggest that it could be.  That is why I certainly take on board and acknowledge the manner in which the Deputy raised the points he has from his policy position.  Many of those things are actually happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600018#Q00200","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666781220,"counter":69,"content":"<p>There is something extremely dysfunctional about housing supply and policy in this country.  The policy can be traced back decades.  It is one of commodification of shelter.  That is the heart of this debate about the crisis of homelessness.  Corporate bodies saw that ideology and they saw bricks and mortar as something to invest and speculate in and get very rich on.  They did this not only in Ireland but across the world.  Politically, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il bought into that ideology as well.  Big developers bought into it and they brought it into Fianna F&aacute;il as well.  The amount of donations that were given to Fianna F&aacute;il over the last 25 years runs into millions of euro.  That tells us something about the heart of dysfunction in the housing market.  People have to go without a home and go into emergency accommodation.  Over 10,000 people in this country are in that situation at this moment.  It is absolutely incredible that the situation is getting worse rather that better.  That ideology was one of looking to the free market and not to public or affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  To its credit, Fianna F&aacute;il in the 1950s and 1960s had a very good policy on public housing.  Many housing estates in Dublin and across the country were built by the Minister's party.  It believed in public housing and social housing.  It believed in communities.  The ideology of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is one of the free market and commodification of shelter.  This has only been compounded by Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011.  That is 11 years of power in the context of its policy.  That has only compounded the issue.  Until we change the ideology and ultimately the Government, the housing crisis will get worse and worse.<\/p>  <p>  I was out canvassing a number of days ago and two young people, teenagers, asked me a very pertinent question.  They asked me why is there homelessness in this country.  I was not struck by the question but by the level of passion in their voices.  Why are there some many people homeless in this country?  I tried to answer that as well as I could.  In that situation young people, and there are many young people here, ask themselves.  They may be in a house at the moment or maybe not.  They will ask themselves why politicians cannot for once sort out the problem of sheltering our citizens.  It is the biggest question and issue of our time.  Politicians on the Minister's side of the House cannot fix it.  That is the question here.  They cannot fix it.  What is wrong?  There is an answer and a solution to every problem.  There should never be people homeless in this country at all.  Once we go with the ideology of the commodification of shelter, unfortunately there are going to be tens of thousands of people in the future in the situation of being homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600019#R00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1666781220,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank all those who contributed to this discussion.  I am not going to get into the war of statistics that these debates often descend into although I am not saying statistics are unimportant.  The Minister has to start with acknowledging the truth.  When the Government says the number on housing lists has falling it is a misrepresentation of the reality.  According to the Parliamentary Budget Office there are actually 122,000 households, if we take waiting lists where people are on HAP, RAS and leasing arrangements, that are not secure tenancies.  The reduction in the numbers on the housing list is overwhelmingly because the Government failed to raise the income thresholds.  People are taken off the list not because they no longer have a housing need, no longer need social housing support or are no longer in a position where they cannot pay the rents out there or afford the housing prices, but because their income goes slightly over the threshold.  They are off the list, it makes the statistics look better and leaves their situation exactly the same.  In fact, it makes their situation worse.<\/p> <p> I referred to the woman who, with her teenage son, has been in one bedroom in emergency accommodation for four years and is not even entitled to HAP support, never mind a council house, because she is over the threshold. There has been a deliberate policy of not raising those thresholds.  I read it in the Government report.  In fact, it was Byron Warren, a transition-year student who is in my office this week, who read the review the Government got last November and pointed out that people in Dublin are paying 60% of their income in rent.  Huge numbers of those people are not entitled to any financial support whatsoever, whether HAP or social housing.  Many of them have been cut off the list because the Government refused to raise the income threshold.  At a time when more households than ever need social housing and social housing support, the proportion of people entitled to that support has been slashed from 48% to about 30%.  That is the reality of the situation.<\/p> <p> The long-term solution is for us to build, on scale, public and affordable housing.  We need at least 20,000 public and affordable houses a year.  Setting that aside, there is stuff the Government could do now.  The reason it does not do it goes back to the point made by Deputy Gino Kenny and others.  We need to get something into our heads regarding the housing misery facing hundreds of thousands of families on housing waiting lists, unable to afford rents and so on, and now the desperate people fleeing from Ukraine.  That misery is benefiting a certain group of people.  In fact, the worse the crisis gets, the more valuable is the rental property of those who own it and the more valuable the lands of those who have planning permission but are sitting on that land.  There are 80,000 such planning permissions and their value is clocking up the worse the housing crisis gets.  That is the elephant in the room when it comes to the housing crisis.  Unless we break our reliance on people who are profiting from the housing crisis, that is, the vulture funds, investors, speculators and property developers, we are not going to solve this crisis.  Indeed, there are worrying indications that private builders are starting to slow down their delivery because they do not see it as profitable for them.<\/p> <p> Setting aside the bigger ideological debate, we propose some immediate solutions to this problem.  First, it should be a case of use it or lose it.  If you have a vacant property - there are 48,000 such that have been vacant since the last census and 160,000 in total - you should have six months to use it or, if there is no good reason for not doing so, you will lose it.  Of course, there are good reasons in some cases but we must have a proactive policy of saying that if a property is vacant for six months or more, it will be taken over by the State and used to provide social and affordable housing if there is no good reason for not doing so.  We need teams of people in every local authority who will go out and pursue those properties and ensure they are brought into use.<\/p> <p> We must rebuild the State's construction capacity.  The Taoiseach is correct that we cannot rebuild it overnight, but he can stop the situation whereby property is being actively run down.  The State and local authorities must start to take on apprentices again and begin to rebuild our direct construction capacity in order that we are not dependent on contractors and developers who, in many cases, are doing what was done in the case of the co-operative housing in Loughlinstown, of which the Taoiseach may be aware, whereby 45 properties are now frozen because the contractor pulled out.  We need our own construction capacity to deal with that situation.  In any situation, whether people are on HAP or RAS, leasing or, as in Tathony House in Dublin 8, where some of the people are over the threshold and are not getting RAS, HAP or leasing support, where a landlord is selling just to benefit from the high prices that can be commanded at the moment, the State must step in and buy the property.  That is not happening and all sorts of excuses are being put up for why that is.  St. Helen's Court still has not got over the line.  There are 17 empty properties sitting there for three years when people, including children, are in homeless accommodation and so on.<\/p> <p> Then we come to income thresholds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600019#R00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666781820,"counter":72,"content":"<p>We are way over time, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600020#S00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1666781820,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Will the Government admit the truth about those who need housing support and raise the thresholds to ensure they are entitled to that support?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600020#S00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666781820,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666781820,"counter":75,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is deferred until the weekly division time this evening.

That strain is caused by the Tory Government's orchestrated undermining of the Good Friday Agreement and its persistent attacks on the protocol.  This self-serving agenda has seeped into the stability of Government and power-sharing in the North.  The Tories facilitated the DUP in using the protocol as pretext for its boycott of the political institutions following last May's election.  The appointment of a new British Prime Minister can bring an opportunity for a real step change in how Britain engages with Ireland and with our European partners.  This can be a chance for a fresh start.  The question is whether it will be.<\/p>  <p>  We need to see relationships based on good faith and a genuine desire for real progress.  For our part, we have contacted Downing Street seeking a meeting with Mr. Sunak as soon as possible.  The new Prime Minister must put a focus and energy into ensuring the implementation of the protocol, the ironing out of outstanding issues and getting the Executive in the North back up and running.  The protocol is widely supported.  It is working.  Of course, if can work better and we want to see that happen sooner rather than later.  Time is of the essence.  The six-month deadline to form an Administration expires on Friday.  Sinn F&eacute;in stands ready to form an Executive for all and ready to work with others to shape a better future.  It is with this objective in mind that the assembly will sit tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  Our message to the DUP is clear.  It must end its boycott, join with us and work with us together in an Executive to tackle the cost of living, fix the health service and make people's lives better.

Political unionism must understand that wrecking the institutions of Government will not usher in direct rule from London.  If the restoration of the Executive in Belfast is blocked indefinitely by the DUP, the only alternative will be an arrangement of joint authority between the Irish State and the British state.  This is in line with the position taken in 2006 by the Irish and British Governments when facing a deadlock situation.  Fractured relationships serve nobody.  We need partnership and a commitment to make politics work in the interests of the people.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Taoiseach will speak with the new British Prime Minister this evening.  I very much hope the D&aacute;il can maintain a unified stance on the important matters ahead.  I have no doubt he will make clear to Mr. Sunak that the British Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and must play a constructive role in implementing the protocol through a negotiated settlement.  No doubt the Taoiseach will make clear that the North's democratic institutions must be restored as a matter of priority and, in the event they are not, that direct rule from London is off the table.  Have those in the Irish Government engaged with their British counterparst to prepare for joint authority arrangements should the formation of an Executive continue to be blocked?  Can the Taoiseach tell us what stage those preparations are at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600020#S00700","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1666781820,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas le Pr&iacute;omh-Aire nua na Breataine, Rishi Sunak, as &eacute; a bheith tofa mar phr&iacute;omh-aire.

I look forward to having the opportunity to engage with him later today.  What has sustained this House over the last difficult period since Brexit happened has been the unity of purpose in Ireland's fundamental aims and objectives.  We were never supporters of Brexit, but we respect the decision of the British people to leave the European Union.  The issues that have arisen from that decision have clearly not been resolved, namely, the relationship between Britain and the European Union, the British-Irish relationship and, more specifically, the continuation of the trading relationship between Europe and Britain and how that impacts on Northern Ireland.  The protocol was designed to deal with that trading relationship.  From my engagement with industry and businesses in Northern Ireland, particularly in manufacturing and the food industry, they have said the protocol has been very beneficial.  In fact, the food industry has said the legislation that is going through the House of Lords at the moment would be injurious to it, given the dual regulatory framework of that legislation.  It would disrupt the integrity of the food chain from beginning to the end, onto the market, and could have very serious consequences for the food industry.  I said that to the previous Primer Minister, Liz Truss, who, to be fair, did indicate to me a resolve to get these issues decided between Europe and Britain through negotiation.  I hope the new Prime Minister will equally believe in that idea that negotiation is the preferred option in resolving the issues around the protocol.  Europe stands ready.  I have had regular engagement with President von der Leyen and with Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d.  I am in no doubt that Europe stands ready to be flexible in all matters pertaining to the protocol, and in the context of the geopolitical difficulties that we are facing across Europe, with the first war on the Continent of Europe since the Second World War, the need for like-minded countries, such as the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan and so forth, to be together in dealing with that issue.  That really puts the issue of the protocol, and the necessity to get it resolved, into context.<\/p> <p> I have made it clear to the DUP that the party should come back into the assembly and facilitate the restoration of the assembly and the Executive.  It is a denial of democracy not to do so.  I have been very consistent, since the election, that the results of the election should be vindicated.  The people have voted and the results should be reflected in the composition of the Executive, the positions of First Minister and deputy First Minister, and the operation of the assembly.  I have held that position for a long time.  In previous periods when the Executive was taken down or stopped meeting for various reasons, I called it out then just as I call it out now.  When people elect their representatives, they expect their parliament to be elected.  On what happens in the event of no restoration, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference kicks in.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for meetings of that group, with close consultation with the Irish Government in matters pertaining to Northern Ireland.  I will come back in on the supplementary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600020#S00800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666782420,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I have absolutely no doubt Europe is ready and, indeed, has been ready and has shown remarkable flexibility in dealing with the issues of concern around the protocol.

I, too, hope we get to a position where we have a functioning Executive, a First Minister for all and a functioning assembly.  That is where this needs to land.  However, it is essential everybody understands that the alternative to that is not a return to direct rule from London.

Gas prices have dropped by more than two thirds since the summer.  Yesterday's benchmark futures dropped to &euro;92 per MWh, down from an astronomical &euro;340 per MWh in August.  A number of factors are feeding into this.  The EU set a target for having its gas stockpiles at 80% by 1 November.  This figure has been exceeded, with storage currently at 92%.  Demand has also reduced, and is down by 7% across the EU so far this year.  Finally, consumption across the EU is around 20% lower than for this time of the year.  It may well be to do with the mild weather, but people are also fearful about turning on the heat.  I understand there are a number of variables feeding into the price reduction.  However, the key point remains that wholesale gas prices have significantly declined from the exorbitant peak we saw earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  Energy companies in this country were quick to increase their prices for consumers when gas prices started to rise.  Electricity prices have gone up by more than 90% over the past 12 months, and energy prices are up by 80%.  This means workers and their families are paying up to an additional &euro;2,000, on average, this year on their energy bills.  It is also important to note the annual price increase did not come in one fell swoop.  Companies have been steadily increasing their prices every three to six months in response to what they say are increases in wholesale energy costs.  This month alone, Electric Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is Energy, SSE Airtricity and Flogas, to name a few, have all hiked their prices by 50%.  While prices have soared, the number of discounts available for customers has been slashed.  The discounts customers get for switching providers are now minuscule.  Switching was the mechanism for ensuring competition between suppliers.  Potential savings for switching have been cut from between 25% and 40% to barely 10% right across the board.  The result is that the energy market here is increasingly resembling a cartel, with almost no real choice for customers.  To put this in context, those who switch their accounts are now missing out on savings of up to &euro;1,000 a year.  That is coming on top of increases in bills of up to &euro;2,000 a year.  Many families facing into the winter will be choosing between feeding their families and heating their homes.  Any reduction cannot come soon enough.<\/p>  <p>  How quickly can we expect to see reductions in energy prices passed onto consumers?  What power does the Government have to ensure energy companies are passing on reduced costs and are not gouging their customers?  In the interim, has the Government acted to give the energy regulator the power to regulate the exorbitant standing charges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600021#T00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1666782420,"counter":83,"content":"<p>First of all, I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, and by prefacing her remarks by referring to some good news.  It does not normally happen in exchanges between the Opposition and the Government sides.  However, I do take the point made by the Deputy.  Today's price is the lowest since June, and it is down more than 70% from the record level of 640 pence hit in August.  That is the gas spot price in the UK market.  It is around 190 pence a therm today.<\/p> <p>That is the lowest since June and considerably lower than the price of 640 pence a therm in August.  That may be the result of temperatures but we also need to reflect on the fact that the European Union working together has an impact.  When the storage policy was first announced more than a year ago, people did not think it was credible that the European Union member states could get to the levels of storage they have.  That has created an impact on the markets.  The work the European Union has been doing to move towards a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to price caps and so on is also having an impact on the market, as is reduced consumption, which is clearly the result of people being fearful of the prices involved.  However, it also points to the inadvisability of moving to a blanket cap of the kind the UK Government originally proposed, and which was also proposed in Ireland.  That would incentivise consumption.  It is a complex matter and the discussions at the EU Energy Council at the moment are complex.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution.  All the markets are different with member states having different energy mixes.  For example, we import 75% of our gas from the United Kingdom and get 25% from the Corrib gas field.  Even to a certain extent, we are more dependent on what happens in the London market than on other markets within Europe.  Security of supply is a key issue for us.  We have prioritised security of supply for the country.  Given that many companies and most utility companies base their prices on future and forward contracts, the recent drop in spot prices may not immediately translate into lower electricity and gas bills for customers.  This country spent &euro;8.3 billion on the importation of energy products in the first eight months of this year compared with &euro;3.4 billion last year.  It is an extraordinary gap.<\/p> <p> Therefore, hopefully it will, but there are other issues also.  Future markets are pointing to higher prices in the coming months.  There is still a certain degree of uncertainty because of political uncertainty, the war in Ukraine and the need to start preparing for winter 2023-24 in terms of further storage and necessities across Europe.  It is by no means certain but it is good news so far in terms of what is happening.<\/p> <p> Europe is focusing on stabilising the spikes in prices we witnessed over the past eight months.  If we could stabilise the market, it would give us greater certainty to plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600021#T00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666783020,"counter":85,"content":"<p>It will only be good news if that is passed on.

I hope this trend will continue beyond the winter.  That would be great news all round.<\/p>  <p>  At European Union level, different member states have different energy mixes.  Gas has been the determining factor in electricity prices.  Some countries have up to a 70% dependence on gas for electricity while other countries' dependence is as low as 20%.

The Taoiseach had been recently elected and was supporting a Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, led by former Deputy Charles Haughey.  The D&aacute;il was debating the Building Control Act, which introduced a regime of self-certification, allowing builders effectively to sign off on projects themselves.  Former Deputy Eamon Gilmore, then of the Workers' Party, said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe principle being enshrined in this section is very dangerous.  It will expose people who are buying homes to buying products which are sub-standard against which they will have no comeback. <\/blockquote>  <p>What was the response of the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, former Deputy P&aacute;draig Flynn?  He said:  &quot;If Deputy Gilmore buys a building without having put in place some checks and without having carried out checks, then he is the one who is being negligent in protecting his own investment.&quot;  That is incredible.  The Minister was blaming the residents and not the builders.  Fianna F&aacute;il opened the door for the kind of defective building we have seen.<\/p><p>Here we are, 33 years on and the fruits of that policy are becoming crystal clear.  According to the report commissioned by the Government and released in July, up to 100,000 apartments and houses around the State are likely affected by defects, mostly fire defects.  That includes Hunterswood, Park West Crescent, Carrickmines Green, a recent development in Inchicore and many others, the owners of which do not yet want their developments named yet.  That is only the tip of the iceberg.  Most people who are affected do not yet know it yet.  There are probably significant defects in any apartment or duplex built between 1991 and 2013.  Those homeowners will have a very unwelcome surprise coming in the form of a bill of an average of &euro;25,000.  For many, it will be much more than that.  It is money that people simply do not have.  Contrary to what the then Minister, P&aacute;draig Flynn, was suggesting, that is not their fault.  They did everything right when they bought their property.  It is why residents have come together to launch a campaign called Not Our Fault.  They are calling a major public conference open to all affected in a few weeks' time.<\/p><p>The Government has had the expert group report from which these figures come since July.  A month ago, the Government set up another group, an interdepartmental and agency group, to look into the issue.  The people who are living with the fruits of Fianna F&aacute;il policy know what the answer is.  It is extremely simple.  A 100% redress scheme is the only just solution.  It is also the only workable solution.  The scheme should be retrospective and the State should then pursue the builders responsible.<\/p><p>Last week, residents in Park West Crescent voted not to pay the &euro;68,500 they were being asked to in order to address fire defects.  Residents in Hunterswood did the same a few months ago.  Nobody is going to hand over enormous amounts of money now when the Government has not indicated that the scheme will be retrospective.

He has commissioned the largest and most significant survey of apartment defects in this country.  He has the results of that report.  He has indicated repeatedly to the House that he will be bringing forward a scheme by the end of this year in respect of apartment defects.  He has already introduced a most comprehensive scheme in respect of mica.  A previous Government brought in a scheme in respect of pyrite.  In the first instance, those in construction, including builders and in the case of mica, quarries that supplied defective blocks, are responsible.  The Government has taken the view that the residents facing such a situation should be looked after.  It is not the residents' fault.  That has been the clear position of the Government.

The housing crisis is felt in every part of the country.  Not a day goes by where people call to my constituency office looking for a home or somewhere to stay.  There is a severe housing shortage, spiralling rental costs, and in Louth alone, rents have gone up by 8%.  This is hitting everybody and all walks of life.<\/p>  <p>  I invite the Taoiseach today, together with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, seated beside him, to come to my home town of Dundalk to visit three areas.  At present there are about 30 unoccupied council houses in Dundalk.  I appreciate the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is paying &euro;11,000 to local authorities to get these houses back on the market.  It is taking approximately between six and seven months, if not longer, to get this done.  These are called void reports.  There are 30 families in Dundalk alone, not Drogheda or Ardee, who could walk into these homes tomorrow morning.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is that I want the Taoiseach to come to visit a site on the outskirts of Dundalk.  This developer has planning permission for 500 houses and is willing to put in 150 to 200 modular homes.  These modular homes are fully serviced, are close to schools and shops, and the developer, as I have said, is willing to go ahead with these.  These are family homes for people who are in a very bad situation at the moment and who could be on the waiting list of Louth County Council for as long as ten years.  I have asked all my constituents if they would be willing to go into modular homes and they would be delighted to have a roof over their heads.  As homelessness is at record heights at the moment, this would be a win-win situation for all.<\/p>  <p>  I would then like to take the Taoiseach and the Minister to a factory about ten miles from Dundalk which manufactures modular homes.  These are three- and four-bedroom, top-class and fully fitted modular homes.  They take between four and five weeks to put them together.  The company is willing to put a team together to facilitate these 150 to 200 homes.  I have seen these houses myself.  They are high-spec family homes and, again, I believe it is a win-win for everybody.<\/p>  <p>  With home ownership declining, and no further homes to buy, it is very important we do this.  The present cost to rent a property in Dundalk and the Louth area is &euro;1,420, and that is the cheapest.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to give assurances on the issues I have raised and that he and the Minister will come to Dundalk.  This is just one area and, as I have said, there are many other areas such as Drogheda and Ardee.  The Taoiseach is always asking for solutions.  To me this is a win-win for all.  People at the moment are only talking about modular homes for Ukrainians.  I have no problem with that but I have people coming to my constituency office asking me, where there is a house for rent, to please contact them or the auctioneer.  I could have possibly 20 to 30 such people calling in a day.  This is a win-win for all.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, come to Dundalk to have a look?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600023#V01400","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1666783620,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for the constructive manner in which he has approached it.  From what the Deputy has outlined, I have suggested to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, that he should go up to County Louth for the weekend, where the Deputy could take him around to a few more sites.  The Deputy's points are well made.<\/p>  <p>  Housing is the biggest issue facing us as a society and we have to facilitate all construction types.  We have to reduce and stop objecting left, right and centre to various projects that are coming forward because the scale of the housing need is such that we have to get progress on planning permissions and on housing projects that are well designed.  There have been too many objections over recent years - there is no point in saying otherwise - and these are objections which do not match the crisis.  Everybody needs a mindset change in respect of the enormousness of the challenge facing us in housing, the war on Ukraine, on migration generally, and on those accessing emergency accommodation.  The scale of this is quite enormous.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's point on voids is well made.  Approximately 7,000 voids have been brought back into use in the two years since the Government came into office.  The Minister has given particular attention to ensuring houses are not left idle for any unreasonable length of time and that local authorities get in there - we have provided the funding - and get those houses back into use.  Given the current crisis, it is not good enough that any house would be left void for any period of time.<\/p>  <p>  Modular or rapid-build housing, which is the term I prefer, because these are good, high quality houses with a significant cost per unit, will have to form part of the wider housing building programme we have into the future.  The companies the Deputy is talking about require certainty over a reasonable period of time in terms of the volumes that need to be constructed.  In addition to our conventionally built houses, we need more rapid-build and more timber-framed homes also.  We as a country are unusually low in percentage terms in timber-framed homes compared with other countries like Scotland.  We are therefore developing plans to get additional rapid-build homes over and above the 700 we have already identified in respect of the Ukrainian situation and so that these type homes would be used more broadly.  Again, the capacity exists in the country to do what the Deputy is proposing in respect of rapid-build homes.  Other countries are also doing that and it is something we can do.<\/p> <p>If we get the first projects off the ground, people will develop more confidence in this form of housing.  That is why I am anxious, if I can, to get up to see the company and the areas Deputy Fitzpatrick has identified.  If I cannot, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will certainly do so.  If there is a person who can provide 500 houses on a particular site, we should facilitate him or her and enable that project to be accelerated as quickly as possible because there is great need out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600023#V01500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666784220,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I said earlier on that there had been no objections to this project, which would comprise 150 to 200 modular homes.

The electricity, sewage and gas infrastructure is ready.  There are schools, shops and everything else in the vicinity.  The Government is talking about putting billions aside.  This is just one area.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister please give a commitment to come and look at this project?<\/p>  <p>  The second thing I mentioned was unoccupied council houses.  There are 30 such houses in Dundalk.  Louth County Council should be run as a business.  If I had a business, I would have a thing called a float, which covers normal day-to-day running costs.  I ask the Taoiseach to give Louth County Council a float of &euro;100,000 so that, as unoccupied council houses come up, they can be dealt with straight away rather than waiting five, six, seven or eight months.  These houses are being handed back to the council in perfect condition.  If they are left lying idle for that length of time, they will get damp and everything else.

Clearly this is a multifaceted problem requiring a multi-agency approach.  Key to it is the presence of more visible community policing on the streets and I have raised that with local police and urge that that be a major element but there are other ways by which these issues can be addressed.  Recently, my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in and I met with Merchants Quay Ireland and heard its real concern at the delay in the introduction of supervised injecting facilities on its premises which is one way of addressing serious problems around open drug use on city streets which creates its own difficulties for local residents but very seriously it is also a health and safety issue for those injecting on the streets.  A change in the law was secured by Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in in 2015 to deliver supervised injecting facilities in the city centre but the plan has run into difficulty since.  There is a real lack of urgency from this Government in pursuing and making progress on this.  It is something that was agreed some years ago and which could be rolled out even on a mobile basis.

It is a complex problem but it is mostly emblematic of a failure of Government policy on multiple fronts.  I want to make a very simple point when people give out about activities that are going on on O'Connell Street.  There used to be three supervised public toilets in the O'Connell Street vicinity.  Now there is none.  Particularly for people who are homeless, as a result of another failure of the State, there is nowhere to go to the bathroom.  It is a basic thing.  During Covid we managed to introduce supervised public toilets throughout the city.  As soon as Covid was gone they were taken away.  That is not just true in O'Connell Street but it is true in my area and many other areas.  We showed we could have supervised public toilets and it was good and beneficial, but we removed them immediately.  Many of the public toilets near O'Connell Street are still there.  They are just gated up because we do not put the resources into providing them.  That is a basic elementary thing that we could do as well as the supervised injection centres.<\/p>  <p>  There are solutions that could make an immediate impact.

The north-east inner city initiative has not been going at a glacial pace.  It has been very effective.  I think that is widely acknowledged.  I was recently at the restoration of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station and saw the community room in the station.  There has been tremendous focus in the north-east inner city initiative.  This year, &euro;7.5 million will be allocated to it.  He did make points on the broader issue around task forces more generally.  Yesterday, at the Cabinet meeting on social affairs, I was pursuing an initiative with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, that we would endeavour to reinvigorate local area partnerships and responses to create proper co-ordination but also an approach from the bottom up that would use and leverage from existing agencies, from Tusla to ETBs and the health service, to ensure that we can deal with addiction issues on the ground in many communities across the city and the country.  We are progressing that proposal.  We are making progress on that.  Some significant work has been done in my Department on this initiative.  An assistant secretary is overseeing and co-ordinating across all Departments an initiative and endeavouring to identify the 11 or 12 key areas of the country that need sustained, high-level attention on multiple issues including addiction and community development, education, school completion and many others.  We are pursuing that broader issue.<\/p>  <p>  The north-east inner city initiative does give us an interesting model of what works.  For example, there was an external chair who was not involved in any particular stakeholder group who chaired that initiative.  That has worked well.  There have been significant initiatives coming out of it in investment and physical infrastructure, community facilities and so on.<\/p>  <p>  On the broader issue which Deputy Bacik raised, I am willing to engage with her and Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in on the injection facilities.

The Minister for Justice and the Minister of State with responsibility for law reform met with the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, and the assistant commissioner, Angela Willis, from the Dublin Metropolitan Region to discuss safety and anti-social behaviour in Dublin and other areas following public concern over a number of incidents.  The Minister asked the Commissioner to review the operation of anti-social behaviour legislation and procedures.  She also asked the Commissioner about improving the use of anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs, including the disparity in the use of ASBOs in different areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the programme for Government commitment, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, established an expert forum on anti-social behaviour in 2020.  This forum will examine the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.  The forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counter the negative impact on community morale and quality of life.  There are two subgroups considering knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes specifically.  Other subgroups may be established.  That is more detail on the medium-term response to some of the issues that were raised.<\/p>  <p>  On O&rsquo;Connell Street, I repeat what I said last week.  I do think that we need to get on with the physical refurbishment of O&rsquo;Connell Street.  My own experience, having been on city councils in the past, is that streets can be transformed with investment in their streetscape.  For a long time, with O&rsquo;Connell Street and in and around Moore Street and the GPO, there has been exhaustive discussion among parties and political parties at local and national level, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was involved, trying to reconcile the various interests around the heritage site and so on.  Eventually agreement was reached.  There is not full unanimity on it and there are objections and so on.

The forum aims to address under-representation of women and further develop women's role in peace-building and civic society.  Its work has been supported through the reconciliation fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I was pleased to launch the forum's first report on 8 September.  This set out its first term of work and made recommendations, for both jurisdictions on the island, on tackling gender-based violence, civic engagement, education, media and women's political participation.  The Government will consider and positively engage with the forum's recommendations, consulting the Executive and the UK Government, as relevant.<\/p>  <p>  The Government looks forward to continuing to engage with the All-Island Women's Forum as it continues to provide an important, necessary space for civic dialogue led by women, contributing to wider public debates and helping to shape the all-island civic agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600029#BB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666787220,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I commend the work of the All-Island Women's Forum and its commitment to fully inclusive engagement.

She was also a president of the Labour Party of Northern Ireland and played an invaluable grassroots role in the peace process through her work as a founding member of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition.  One of her passions was integrated education.  Her work on integrated education in Northern Ireland provides a pathway to addressing the divisions that remain.  One of the recommendations of the All-Island Women's Forum was the expansion of integrated education and Educate Together models.

This is the party that backed the disastrous policies of May, Johnson and Truss and failed to do anything about the cost-of-living crisis affecting working-class people in the North across the sectarian divide.  Now, more than ever, we need socialists like Gerry Carroll in Stormont building an alternative to the <i>status quo<\/i>, supporting workers' struggles and putting forward a politics of class, not creed.

Both of them were testifying to the fact that, even though we have a lot of State money going into the live action film area, the contracts that performers here get are grossly inferior to those in the UK or in the North in terms of their access to royalties for the future use of their performances and their general pay and conditions.  That is also true for crew.

We will pursue that.  We have the capacity to do it working with the various groups North and South and the agencies that are in a position to collect the data and do the research.  I will follow up on that.  The recommendations put forward by the forum include the development of an all-island approach to ending gender-based violence.  We would be interested in doing that and following up on it.  Deputy Gould might be interested to know that next month the Minister for Justice is convening a shared island dialogue on tackling gender-based violence and abuse.  That would be a very useful dialogue and engagement to bring this issue further forward.  I would see merit in research that would look generally at the issue, but also at wider issues such as the under-representation of women on the island more generally.  I have asked the shared island unit in my Department to consider that and to work in consultation with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the relevant Northern Ireland Executive departments.<\/p>  <p>  On the further recommendations on the civic forums and their establishment, which was provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, the parties did not develop or show great enthusiasm for the civic forums, which was a mistake.  We would support the recommendation from the women&rsquo;s forum.  There is potential for synergy in the development of a media partnership between broadcasters to amplify women&rsquo;s voices, on gender quotas for assembly elections and local elections, and on a wider range of issues that overlap with those of the recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality and the Oireachtas committee.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan that there is tremendous potential here to concentrate on what we can do together as opposed to that which divides us.  The whole ethos has been without prejudice to the constitutional position of people, that we plough ahead and make progress on a range of issues such as climate, biodiversity restoration, economic development, education and so on.  The Deputy's points are well made.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised a more specific question.  I will check that out in terms of the research by the Manchester Metropolitan University.  I will ask the Minister for Health where that is.  I do not see why it would not be published.  I understand the UK Government has now come forward with the legislation in respect of termination of pregnancy services in Northern Ireland.  There were issues on the ground in terms of getting that through the assembly when it was up and running prior to the last election, just as there was with the Irish language Act, so Westminster is facilitating the passage of both issues, which have been deadlocked for some time.  That remains the position.  There is a timeline for the review of the legislation on the termination of pregnancy in the Republic.  The review is under way, and it is informed by the research the Deputy referenced.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to bring recommendations from the review and to publish it in due course.<\/p>  <p>  I concur with Deputy Bacik&rsquo;s very strong tribute to May Blood and the contribution she made to reconciliation, integration and the promotion of a progressive perspective on the future of Northern Ireland and politics within the island, and to the Labour Party within Northern Ireland, which lost a lot of support over time.  One of my first engagements in the North was when I was a young student.  I went to the Shankill area to meet Alf Midgley, who was a social worker in the area.  His father was a Labour Party MP, Harry Midgley.  I got a very strong sense of his commitment to the working people of that area.  The Labour Party has an honourable tradition within Northern Ireland.  Because of the polarisation and the sectarianism and the degree to which the electoral system always gravitated towards getting people back into trenches, so to speak, it has never allowed for that type of what we might call normal politics to emerge.  There are issues there that must be considered in the future.  The elections we have had should be vindicated.  We cannot mess around with that.  We should allow the full validity and integrity of those elections to be followed in terms of the restoration of the Executive and the assembly and then, in the fullness of time, in five years&rsquo; time, when there is to be a future election, we would have a different system.  There is time to review that.  It is a necessity.  I think it was Deputy Boyd Barrett or Deputy Paul Murphy who raised the question on the way the electoral system currently works.  It could be argued that it is polarising and does not allow for the multiplicity of views to come through.  Right now, the results of the election must be validated.  By that I mean the Executive should be restored, and the First Minister and the deputy First Minister should be as per the election results.<\/p>  <p>  On the film industry, that is an issue I will raise with the Minister, Deputy Martin.  It is open to Deputy Boyd Barrett and others to make a submission to the shared island unit in respect of that, although it is more of an industrial relations issue.  Broadly speaking, we want to create parity and we want to learn from the experiences North and South, and if the situation is better in the North, then we in the Republic can learn from that in respect of the film industry.  We are open to improving our situation in the Republic.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Bacik&rsquo;s point on education, I have been passionate about school completion.  It is one of the key weaknesses in certain areas within the North.  We are very anxious to engage with a Northern Ireland Executive, following on from the ESRI research on school completion in the Republic and in the North on whether lessons can be learned.  We would be willing to use the shared island fund to underpin initiatives to help school completion outcomes in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600030#CC00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1666787820,"counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600030#CC00300"},{"type":"question","time":1666787820,"counter":240,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[49705\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600030#CC00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on Government co-ordination will next meet.

The blame for this solely lies with the Government&rsquo;s failed housing policies over the past six years where Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been together.  The Government has completely failed to get a grip on the issue and the reality now is social housing is no longer a safety net.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, has done nothing but push up the price of houses.  The Government has no real plan to tackle the crisis.  Will the Taoiseach give us any detail on emergency accommodation that will be rolled out in Cork, because the crisis is getting much worse and families and individuals are struggling as they enter homelessness?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600030#CC01100","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1666788420,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I raised the issue of the efforts being made to house Ukrainian refugees and, indeed, others coming here seeking international protection and fleeing persecution abroad.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I sought a briefing for Opposition leaders and spokespersons as we are keen to engage constructively with the Government in assisting what has to be a collective national effort to ensure sufficient accommodation is available for those who come here seeking refuge and that we do not see any more people sleeping on the floor in Dublin Airport.  What I have heard from communities in my constituency and across the country is real concern that we seem not to have the capacity available, yet we know that capacity is there.  Even since yesterday, I have continued to engage with the Government on seeking to put forward proposals for vacant premises that can be used to house those in need of refuge.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned to hear that the plan for modular homes is being so delayed.  In July, I hosted a briefing in Leinster House with members of the Ukraine civil society forum, and at that point, the members sought a more co-ordinated structure, better management and better communication with local authorities and communities to ensure we would have a short, medium and long-term plan for the housing of refugees.  Indeed, that plan had to include modular housing.  We now hear that the Office of Public Works, OPW, will install 700 units of modular housing but that these will not come on stream until January and February.  It is of concern that there appears to be some opposition to the housing of such sites in different communities.  What approach will the Government and the Cabinet committee take now to address this urgent need to ensure accommodation is put in place for refugees, to ensure sufficient homes and units will be available and to ensure we are able to step up?<\/p>  <p>  This morning, I met the Czech delegation.  The Czech Government and people have so far housed four times as many refugees from Ukraine per head of population as we have.

We have been in government for two and a half years and, since then, we have made significant efforts on the housing issue.  It is the biggest social issue facing us.  We have a lot more to do but, this year, we have the highest number of housing completions since 2008.  We have the highest number of commencements on record, the highest number of planning permissions since 2007, the highest number of first-time buyers, at 16,000, since 2007 and the highest number of home buyers since 2008.  Also, the highest number of social houses will be provided this year.  Progress is being made and we will reach our target of 25,000 houses this year.<\/p>  <p>  What held the Government back were the two shutdowns during Covid over the past two years, which depressed construction activity in house building but we had to do it because of Covid and the lockdowns.  We were then hit with the dramatic increase in the costs of building materials, such as steel, timber and so on, because of the supply chain issues that arose out of the economic recovery from Covid and the war in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding those storms, and we need balance in all this, in fairness, not just the usual knockabout stuff the Deputy and his party go on with, ignoring Covid, the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine and just shouting \"failure, failure, failure\", we have developed solid foundations legislatively through the Land Development Agency, for example, the Affordable Housing Act and various schemes such as the first home scheme to help first-time buyers, in addition to the existing help-to-buy scheme.  Fianna F&aacute;il, a party the Deputy attacked, is committed to building more social houses and, along with our colleagues in government, we are determined to do that.  Our colleagues in the three Government parties will look at any additional measures that can be brought on board to increase housing supply and get more houses into use for people who need them.<\/p>  <p>  In Cork, some very good work has been done by both Cork City Council and Cork County Council, to be fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600031#DD00900","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666788420,"counter":257,"content":"<p>They are hitting all their targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600031#DD01000","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1666788420,"counter":258,"content":"<p>They are proposing cost rental and developing affordable as well as social housing projects, and they are also doing a lot of good work in respect of the Ukrainian situation by creating good projects to house Ukrainians and to co-ordinate work around those fleeing the war in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bacik raised that issue specifically.  I am hoping that meeting can be organised whereby an official could brief party leaders either tomorrow or Friday, whichever can be arranged subject to their own hectic schedules.  In the eight months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the State has housed more than 43,000 people.  Many more, coming up to 55,000 in total, have come into Ireland and some have been availing of people they already knew and so on.  Unlike other countries, we did not have a strong resident Ukrainian population prior to the war.  Other countries did and that gave them greater flexibility.<\/p> <p>That figure was 43,000, however,  In addition, 11,700 people have arrived in Ireland seeking international protection more generally from across the world.  In total, we are potentially looking at approximately 60,000 refugees from Ukraine and the rest of the world who have been housed in Ireland.  The average annual arrivals under international protection in 2019 numbered 3,500.  That figure has risen from 3,500 to 60,000.  Deputy Gould said it was coming for years.

Again, we appreciate the constructive role Deputy Bacik has played in terms of giving any potential properties that we can act upon in terms of the call for pledges but also the reconfiguration of existing buildings and development of modular accommodation or as I prefer to call it, rapid-build high-quality housing.  Again, that ran into objections and issues.  We have to expedite the mechanisms by which we get these projects over the line, which I accept.  We even heard this morning on the radio that people have concerns about it and say they want more consultation and more engagement.  It is an emergency and we need to get these projects up and running as quickly as we possibly can through both the reconfiguration of existing facilities, which the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is leading, and the development of rapid-build units.  We need to do far more of that, more generally, in terms of housing.  It could be particularly helpful in terms of dealing with emergency accommodation and the avoidance of homelessness, for example.  These are high-quality units.  I would argue that they are far superior to some of the existing local authority flats, for example, in some locations.  We need to get on with it.  We are committed to doing that and refurbishing buildings.  The refurbishment programme to date has provided 2,145 beds with another 162 due to come on stream.

I also wish to record my thanks to the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for providing the necessary waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny and to the Chief Whip for enabling the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 to be debated on Second Stage today.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the House to pass the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 today to enable its early enactment to make emergency provision to defer the termination dates of certain residential tenancies that fall, or would fall, during the period beginning on the day after the date of the enactment of this Bill and ending on 31 March 2023 to mitigate the risk that persons whose tenancies would otherwise be terminated during that period would be unable to obtain alternative accommodation, and to provide for phased arrangements to enable tenancies affected to be terminated over the period from 1 April to 18 June 2023 to assist in managing demands on housing services as a result of such deferred termination.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people entering homeless emergency accommodation has been increasing since the start of this year.  There have also been increases in notices of termination from private rental accommodation during this period.  My Department and local authorities have taken a number of steps to deal with the situation.  Given the extraordinary situation and ongoing increases in the numbers of people accessing emergency accommodation, however, additional emergency measures are now required.  This Bill provides for deferment of certain tenancy terminations taking effect over the coming winter emergency period due to the ongoing, acute supply constraints in the residential rental sector and the expected increase in homelessness presentations over the coming period.  The Bill seeks to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants during the winter months.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises that although a landlord&rsquo;s constitutionally protected property right to terminate a tenancy will be constrained by this Bill, it is necessary to take this step to achieve an urgent social objective of preventing tenants being made homeless or having to source alternative accommodation in an extremely constrained market during the coming winter months.  To ensure the response is proportionate, the measures in this Bill are limited to the winter of 2022-2023, they will impact only in respect of certain tenancies, and they are calibrated to apply as fairly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In proposing the termination pause, the Government is balancing the competing priorities of preventing people falling into homelessness and recognising the need to stem fairly the continued exit of small-scale landlords from the private rental sector.  The Government is conscious of the need to ensure small-scale landlords remain in the private rental market.  With this in mind, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, has commissioned a comprehensive review of the sector after significant regulatory changes over recent years and the Department will act on its recommendations as soon as practical.  Our housing system needs a safe, secure framework for both landlords and tenants.<\/p>  <p>  I am also conscious that, if passed, this Bill provides a window of time for my Department, local authorities, approved housing bodies and NGOs to progress delivery under Housing for All to remove the need for this emergency legislation.  The Government is taking significant steps to address the supply constraints in the housing market and to deliver homes for rent and purchase, including social, affordable and cost rental housing.  However, there are a number of factors, including the increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness, increased demand for accommodation resulting from the Ukrainian crisis and significant inward migration, which are combining to create significant difficulties in the provision of emergency accommodation, particularly over the coming months.  This is placing additional pressure on homelessness services as we enter the winter period when capacity constraints are extremely tight for emergency accommodation and housing providers generally.<\/p> <p>I assure Deputies that the Government, my departmental officials and I are doing everything within our power to mitigate pressures people will face this winter.  For tenants who are struggling to meet their obligations to pay rent, in particular due to loss of employment, there are supports available to help.  These include the provision of rent supplement and-or the use of additional needs payments from the Department of Social Protection to address individuals' particular needs.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department of Social Protection can make additional needs payments to help meet expenses a person cannot pay from his or her weekly income.  This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from someone's own resources and are deemed necessary.<br\/><br\/>As well as assisting people with fuel, utility bills and repairs, among several other eligible costs, access to additional needs payments is available to assist persons with rent deposits.  The social protection schemes are demand-led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of each case, to ensure the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Any person who considers that he or she may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact his or her local community welfare service.  Otherwise, people may contact the national community welfare office, which will direct callers to the appropriate office.<br\/><br\/>The housing assistance payment, HAP, is available as a social housing support from local authorities for people who have a long-term housing need.  Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP.  Where the circumstances of rent supplement or HAP recipients worsen, they should contact the Department of Social Protection or their local authority, respectively, for any additional help.<br\/><br\/>This Bill gives us breathing space but it is not a solution to the issues we face.  I recognise there are major trade-offs in undertaking such an emergency measure.  We need to use this respite to expand capacity by all means available to address the core underlying issues driving our homelessness levels.  This means providing more emergency beds, tackling vacancy, using modular homes and improving allocations and relettings to make the most of existing stock.  To tackle homelessness in the immediate term, there are more than 500 additional beds due to come on stream in Dublin through a combination of new short-term leasing agreements, the opening of a new facility and the reopening of a facility following temporary closure for essential works.  More than half of these additional beds will be operational in the coming weeks and the remainder in the coming months.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, is entering into a leasing agreement to secure the ongoing exclusive use of a further 415 beds that are already in use.  The Department has recently given approval to three capital projects in Dublin, one of which will open next month.  These will yield an additional 154 emergency beds.  A further seven capital projects are being reviewed and have the potential to add a further significant number of emergency beds in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>Following on from the voids programme of 2020 and 2021, which delivered more than 6,000 units of social housing stock, a new voids programme was introduced for 2022.  The allocation of tenancies of void properties is subject to the requirement that a household is on the social housing waiting list and the property is allocated in accordance with the allocation scheme in the relevant local authority area.  Homelessness ranks very highly in the order of priorities across all local authority allocation schemes, in recognition that homeless households are particularly vulnerable.  The refurbishment and return to use of as many vacant properties as possible, both public and private, can increase available supply and help to alleviate the homelessness situation.  Local authorities have been encouraged to be as proactive as possible in returning vacant properties to use by availing of the voids programme funding, their own local authority resources and the use of the buy and renew and repair and lease schemes.  I have tasked each local authority to review and improve its allocation and reletting process to ensure each unit is maximised.<br\/><br\/>The Department is supporting local authorities to acquire homes for social housing for priority purposes, including acquisitions that support a household to exit homelessness and acquisitions with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>to prevent homelessness.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has given local authorities clear instructions and the sanction needed to undertake ramped-up tenant <i>in situ<\/i>purchases.  To expand emergency accommodation in the short term, my Department is also working with the Office of Public Works, OPW, to undertake significant modular home construction.  This new delivery mechanism will help swiftly to increase our capacity.<br\/><br\/>Housing for All continues to deliver homes at scale.  Including acquisition and leasing, we are currently projecting that more than 10,000 new social homes will be delivered this year, with record levels of direct new-build construction.  It has, yet again, been a year of volatility for the construction sector.  The impact of construction products inflation, supply chain issues and rising energy prices have created a difficult delivery environment.  However, prices are stabilising and the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, reports supply chain issues are generally resolved.  Therefore, we are seeing something of a recovery and will see very strong delivery of social housing in quarter 4.<br\/><br\/>We have modified the repair and leasing scheme to open up more opportunities to bring accommodation on stream, including by the conversion of commercial units to residential use.  Workshops have been held with local authorities to promote increased uptake of the scheme.  We are putting a significant focus on the building pipeline for future years and the development of housing delivery action plans have proven very successful in this regard.  All local authorities have finalised their plans for social and affordable delivery from 2022 to 2026.  These plans will provide an important framework for delivery in the coming years and will be reviewed in light of delivery this year.  My Department is also working with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance on the potential emergency expansion of long-term leasing to deliver an additional 1,000 social housing units.  An independent valuation of expressions of interest received is now under way and should be concluded in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>As committed to under Housing for All, the first affordable cost-rental homes are now beginning to come onto the market, some of which were advertised at rates that are 40% to 50% lower than market rent.  Cost rental is a State-backed form of tenure aimed at middle-income households under which the price of rent is equal to the cost of building, managing and maintaining the home only and over a set period of time, most usually 40 years.  This means prices are not driven by market movements, making them more affordable, and they are not profit-driven.  Many cost-rental homes have been tenanted since the passing of the Affordable Housing Act in July 2021, which has facilitated this form of rental tenure.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the emergency provisions contained in the Bill.  It is important, at the outset, to note the exceptions to its provisions.  These exceptions are provided in recognition of constitutionally protected property rights and the need to balance the rights of the tenant with those of the landlord.  The deferral of notices of termination from taking effect during the winter will not apply where there is a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations under the tenancy.  The core rights of a landlord to protect his or her property and to secure a rental income will not be limited by the Bill.  Landlords' obligations to their tenants and to third parties, such as neighbours, do not change under the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I will outline the specific provisions of the Bill, which contains 5 sections.  Sections 1 and 5 contain standard provisions dealing with the interpretation, Short Title and collective citation of the Bill.  The &quot;winter emergency period&quot; is defined to mean the period commencing on the day after the enactment of the Bill and ending on 31 March 2023.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 provides for the deferral of a notice of termination where it has been served by a landlord on or before the date of the passing of the Act and specifies a termination date that falls during the winter emergency period, or where a dispute in regard to the termination of a tenancy is referred to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, under Part 6 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and a determination order is issued in respect of the dispute that specifies a termination date that falls during the winter emergency period.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the exceptions, as I have alluded to, the deferral does not apply to a notice of termination where the termination is grounded on the tenant's failure to meet his or her obligations under section 16 of the 2004 Act or where the landlord states in the notice of termination that the reason for the termination is on the ground of a breach of tenant obligations other than to pay rent, on the ground of a breach of a tenant's obligation to pay rent or on the ground that the accommodation no longer suits the tenant's accommodation needs, having regard to the number of bed spaces and the size of the household.<br\/><br\/>Some concerns have been raised about continuing to allow a landlord to terminate a tenancy during the winter on foot of overcrowding.  A number of Deputies have submitted amendments on this issue and we can debate them fully on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>For now, I wish to be clear that the Oireachtas should not seek to prevent a landlord from fulfilling his or her obligations to tenants and their neighbours.  Overcrowding can be very serious and a landlord needs the legal right to act to prevent it.  It is very rarely used, with less than 2% of all notices of termination referred under it.  In reality, only a small such number of notices of termination already issued will be impacted by this exception during the winter emergency period, but it is important in instances of clear health and safety or fire risks.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Section 2(3) of the Bill sets out, in a table, how the deferment of relevant tenancy terminations will operate.  As can be seen, the deferment dates operate in a staggered fashion beyond the winter period to ensure that there is no cliff edge at the end of the period, which would put unmanageable pressure on the private rental market and homelessness services.  The timing operates to provide proportionately greater protection to those tenants on the shortest termination periods.  The aim is to provide additional time to those most in need of extra time to secure alternative accommodation.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 of the Bill provides that, where a tenant is not in breach of his or her obligations, any notice of termination served by a landlord in respect of a tenancy of less than six months duration during the winter emergency period shall not specify a termination date that falls earlier than 18 June 2023.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the interoperability of the Bill with the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 introduced to deal with the Covid pandemic.  Should a stay on tenancy terminations come into effect under that Act, in the event of people's movements being restricted on public health grounds to within 5 km of their home under section 31A health regulations made by the Minister for Health, the revised termination date that applies to affected tenancies in an area under that Act would apply, if later than the relevant deferred termination date under this Bill.  The Bill also provides that a tenant shall not accrue rights under Part 4, Security of Tenure, of the Act of 2004 by virtue of the operation of the deferred, or later, termination dates required under this Bill.  The Bill is framed in a proportionate and fair manner in its limitation of landlord&rsquo;s constitutionally protected property rights.<br\/><br\/>As legislators, we have shown throughout the pandemic how we can work together quickly to help tenants.  I think that we can all appreciate and recognise the sentiment behind this Bill, a sentiment that I believe is shared by the vast majority of Deputies.  This Bill will deliver enhanced tenancy protections when they are most needed over the coming winter months.  The Government is very aware of the increasing pressure on homelessness services, the limited supply of rental accommodation and the struggles that people will face over the coming winter months.  These temporary and emergency measures will protect tenants from the prospect of homelessness by deferring any no fault tenancy terminations from taking place this winter.  We will use this breathing space to ramp up emergency supply.<br\/><br\/>Improving standards, security and affordability for tenants is a key priority for this Government.  We will continue with the implementation of Housing for All and significantly increase the supply of housing across the country.  While this emergency Bill is necessary and will provide assistance to tenants in the short term, I want to underline that the only solution into the medium and longer term to the crisis in the rental sector and in the wider housing sector is sustainably and quickly to increase our supply of new housing for both rent and purchase.  Landlords, big and small, continue to have a key part to play in the provision of a balanced and affordable rental market.  Today, the Government is asking the sector to accept limitations on their rights, as property owners, for the greater good.  I acknowledge that fact and thank them for their contribution to meeting the challenges that we are now facing.  The Government will ensure that we have a rental market that is fit for purpose and this is something that we will return to when we launch the first year review of Housing for All in the coming weeks.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600033#LL00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666790520,"counter":274,"content":"<p>The most recent reports from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage tell us that homelessness in the State is that the highest level ever recorded since the modern reporting method was introduced.  As the Minister of State knows, in August there were over 10,800 adults and more than 3,000 children in Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage-funded emergency accommodation.  The Minister of State also knows that the real level of homelessness, including adults and children in emergency accommodation funded by other Government Departments, is much higher.  The latest figures from the Department of Justice tell us that there are more than 4,500 adults and children with the legal right to remain in this country and refugee status, who are trapped in direct provision, essentially using it as emergency accommodation.  We know that on any given night, Tusla-funded domestic violence refuges hold about 600 women and children fleeing coercive control and domestic and sexual violence.  At any one time, there are between one and 200 adults and some children in religious institution-run emergency accommodation not funded by the State.  On homelessness in terms of rough sleepers, we know that there are at least 100 people on any given night in those areas where they are counted.  That actually means that tonight, the number of adults and children in one form of emergency accommodation or another or sleeping rough on the streets is about 16,200.  That does not include the unaccounted homeless - all those adults and children who are in what is known as own-door transitional accommodation funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the many thousands of people who are sofa surfing.  Whatever way it is counted, we have the worst homelessness crisis in the modern history of this State.  Since Deputy O'Brien has been the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and he is almost approaching his halfway mark, almost all categories of homelessness have increased.  In his almost two and a half years in charge, adult homelessness is up 25%.  The highest level of homelessness among single adults has been recorded, and is up 19%.  The number of families with children in emergency accommodation is up 28%, and the number of children in such accommodation is up 25%.<\/p><p>The question has to be asked as to why this is happening.  What is it that is going on, since this Government took office, that is leading to this catastrophe?  The central reason why homelessness is spiralling out of control is because of the low, and continually missed, social housing targets of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  First of all, those targets are too low.  I keep making the point that this Government actually has a lower social housing output than was previously included in the original Fine Gael national development plan, but the Department is not even meeting that target.  In 2020 we fell short of social housing targets by 25%, and in 2021, it was 30%.  That is 5,969 social homes that should have been delivered that have been lost to the system.  If we want to know why so many people are currently homeless, that is the key missing part of the answer.  The Minister of State knows that as of the halfway point of this year, only 20% of the targeted 9,000 social homes will be delivered.  We will wait eagerly to see what is the final output.  On top of that, despite the fact that we were calling for the reintroduction of the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme last year, through which local authorities would buy properties with HAP, RAS or rent supplement tenants <i>in situ<\/i>, that has only been reintroduced recently and the instruction to the local authorities is not strong enough.  I will come back to that point later.  The affordable housing targets themselves are an embarrassment.  They are so low as really to suggest that this Government is not serious about either cost rental or affordable purchase, and even those low targets cannot be met.  Worse still, we still do not have any meaningful action on raising the thresholds for social housing eligibility, so people who cannot actually afford to buy or rent in the market also cannot access social housing supports and are left languishing in homelessness.<\/p><p>At some point there has to be a lightbulb moment when the Minister of State's Government realises that in fact, the cause of this homeless problem is not what is going on in the private rental sector.  That is a trigger and it is not helping.  It is the Government's failure, policy, inaction and missed targets.  That is why today the Minister of State is bringing forward this emergency Bill, a Bill, in fact, that the Minister of State's party did not want to introduce.  Indeed, several days before it was approved at Cabinet, the Minister of State's party leader, the T&aacute;naiste, was very hostile to its introduction in his public remarks.  It is the Government's housing policy failure that has led us to where we are.  Some 19 of our local authorities have no emergency accommodation on any given night and the rest are almost full to capacity.<\/p><p>Let me be very clear.  As the Minister of State is aware, we have been calling for this Bill for some time.  We have always wanted a temporary winter ban on evictions to give us some breathing space and we are supporting this legislation.  However, I must say that there significant weaknesses with the Bill and with the content of the Minister of State's speech in terms of how the Government intends to use the breathing space.  I will deal with them in the remainder of my time.<\/p><p>On the overcrowding provisions of this Bill, a big mistake has been made.  The Minister of State is absolutely right that a very small number of notices to quit are made under those provisions.  However, the majority of the people who receive those notices to quit are large families.  They are Travellers, Roma people or families from certain African countries who, for completely legitimate cultural reasons, have more children.<\/p> <p>When they become homeless, and the Minister knows the figures, they spend three or four years in emergency accommodation.  In fact, the Minister in 2020 introduced a special provision for local authorities to be able to buy large vacant homes on the private market to try to get those families out of emergency accommodation and yet he is now giving an opportunity to landlords to evict such families.  That will have devastating consequences.  I plead with him not to do this.  There is no need for it and that measure should be removed from the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The Minister is also creating a loophole because some unscrupulous landlords who are now unable to issue a notice to quit, for example on the grounds of sale or use by a family member, could use this measure because for several years, they have had a family in their unit that is larger than is provided for in the outdated 1966 overcrowding legislation, and they can use this provision as grounds for eviction.  Not only is the Minister jeopardising the well-being of very vulnerable larger families, particularly Travellers, Roma and some African families, but he is also creating a loophole for a small number of unscrupulous landlords to exploit.  Even if the Minister listens to nothing else we say, I urge him to remove that provision between now and tomorrow.<br\/><br\/>It is disappointing that there is no additional provision for those people whose due date falls before the commencement of the Act.  I know the same level of provision cannot be provided because of the way the legislation is designed, but the Minister could have done something in terms of extra discretion for the Residential Tenancies Board when deciding on those cases where people are forced to overhold because they have no access to emergency accommodation or alternative permanent housing to give them more time.  The issue of the commencement date of the Bill is key.  We need the Minister to be clear about when it will commence so people know when they are getting protection.<br\/><br\/>Let us also not forget that council tenants get no protection in this legislation because, of course, they are not tenants as registered under the Residential Tenancies Act.  Travellers on either official or unofficial halting sites get no protection.  The Minister will remember that when the most recent ban on evictions was introduced, a circular was issued to the local authorities to urge them to accept the spirit of this legislation in their practices.  I urge him to do the same again.  I am concerned there was no reference to that in the Minister's opening speech.<br\/><br\/>Of course, as the Minister said, and he is right, a ban on evictions, and especially a temporary ban, is not a solution even though it gives tenants breathing space.  I must say that the Minister's speech made me even more concerned than I already was at the fact that the Government has no comprehensive emergency plan to take advantage of these five months to ensure we are not in the same place come April of next year.  In fact, from what I heard in the Minister's speech, all that is being considered in respect of additional accommodation is 654 emergency beds in Dublin.  While they would be welcome, that is not enough.  I have outlined over and over again what needs to be done.  We need a circular to be sent to the local authorities telling them with regard to the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme to suspend the scheme of letting and ensure that the local authorities buy, subject to price and the structural condition of the property, irrespective of where the social housing applicant is on the scheme of letting.  Without that measure, we will continue to see some councils, such as Kerry County Council, not engaging; councils such as the one in my area only engaging when households have length of time on list; and others responding to the Minister in the spirit in which he has raised it.<br\/><br\/>We also need upfront funding for local authorities to acquire derelict and vacant properties.  Without that, there will no significant movement in that regard.  We need the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to do what the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has done, that is, sign a contract for 1,000 high-grade, good-quality, fully fire compliant modular homes to be put in place in the next five months.  That is achievable and can be done with the right political will.  We need the Minister to use emergency planning powers to get those units on site.  We need to cut the bureaucracy imposed on local authorities and approved housing bodies.  That is among the principal reasons, along with the pandemic and Brexit, they are behind on their targets.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister knows, we are supporting the Bill.  I urge him to act in the spirit of the legislation in respect of the issues around overcrowding and the circular to local authorities on council tenants and Travellers.  I call on him to extend those protections and do much more to ensure that come 1 April next year, we are not in exactly the same position because the Government has again missed its social housing targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600035#NN00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666791120,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I am disappointed with the legislation that has been brought forward.  While we support it and recognise there is a need for an emergency ban on evictions, and there are parts of the legislation we welcome, the Minister has missed an opportunity to go further, which he should have taken.<\/p><p>Child homelessness in Cork has increased by 40% in the past 12 months.  Our homeless figures are now at record levels not only in Cork but nationally.  The hidden homeless have not been covered in this debate.  Those include people who are couch-surfing and rough-sleeping, those in domestic violence centres and families who are in boxrooms in multigenerational households because there is nowhere else for them to go.  According to the Simon Community, there could be up to 290,000 people in those situations, including families and children.<\/p><p>At one time, when you got a notice to quit, it was a devastating blow.  It meant upheaval, the packing of boxes, stress and trying to find alternative accommodation.  It did not, however, mean homelessness and that is what it means now.  For the vast majority of people, a notice to quit is an eviction into homelessness.<\/p><p>This legislation is welcome.  It does one thing but it does not go far enough.  It gives people breathing space for the winter, which is security they need.  It gives people room at least to enjoy their Christmas.  On <i>daft.ie<\/i>today, there are only ten properties available for rent in Cork for less than &euro;1,500.  This is not a functional rental sector.  There are over 200,000 people living in Cork.  How is anyone meant to secure a property when those are the figures involved?  On <i>airbnb.ie<\/i>, 153 properties are available to rent for a short stay of over a week.  At the end of quarter 2 of this year, there were 9,000 vacant properties in Cork city and county.  The Minister spoke earlier about getting local authorities to do more but he needs to do more and give local authorities the necessary funding.  He needs to get rid of all the red tape and bureaucracy that requires local authorities to go to the Department in Dublin and return again.  He should give them the funding in advance in order that they can deal with these issues.<\/p><p>We need more properties for rent and more social housing.  People who are faced with a notice to quit do not have the option of finding a property on <i>airbnb.ie<\/i>and they cannot squat because they will be arrested.  The reality is that this legislation is not enough.  It needs to be a part of a suite of measures.  We need a rent freeze and one month's tax credit given back to people.  We need real protection for renters and a big uptick in the delivery of social housing.<\/p><p>We have heard from the Taoiseach and the Minister about start-ups and what is being done in Ireland.  The facts are that under this Government's watch, rents are at the highest levels they have ever been.  House prices are at the highest levels they have ever been.  Homelessness is also at the highest level it has ever been.  Fine Gael has been in power for 11 years and Fianna F&aacute;il has been supporting Fine Gael for the past six and a half years.  The buck stops with the Government and no one else.<\/p><p>I am dealing with 14 people who are overstaying; whose eviction dates have passed.  People were looking forward to this Bill because they thought the Government would protect them.  It does not.  Their eviction dates have now passed and those people will have nowhere to go unless they are going to overstay and be brought to court.  This legislation does not protect those people.  I have read the Bill from cover to cover and those protections are not there.  It is not a long Bill and there is nothing in it for people who are overstaying.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I have submitted amendments.  We are bringing forward a set of amendments that we feel are credible.  We will try to strengthen the Bill.  We support this Bill but we ask the Minister to consider our amendments and those of others because we need to ensure this Bill is fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600036#OO00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1666791120,"counter":277,"content":"<p>As Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould have said, Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting this Bill.  However, it is a pity that the Government has been dragged kicking and screaming to this point.  The notice to quit file in my office has in recent months filled up at an alarming rate.<\/p> <p>Moreover, from the speeches that have been made on a daily basis in this Chamber, I know it is the same for every other Deputy.<\/p> <p> Families with young children on notices to quit, many of whom are in receipt of HAP, are presenting to my office on a weekly basis.  They are in absolute fear as they face homelessness due to the lack of social and affordable homes and emergency accommodation in the Dublin 15 area.  In fact, there are zero such homes available.  Can we end this nonsense that people on HAP are deemed to be socially housed?  They are not. They have absolutely no security of tenure and that is the essence of a person being socially housed.<\/p> <p> Many of these are families are in circumstances where they have lived and reared their families in their home for many years.  Their children are settled in the area with their school and friends.  They play sports, are involved in dancing and have family living all around them.  They have a full support base and their lives are rooted in these areas. They grew up in and lived and worked there and now they face homelessness and, particularly in Dublin 15, they have to move away from their own community because there are zero places to rent and there is no homeless accommodation available.<\/p> <p> They face the daily grind of having to move out of Dublin 15, in many cases to unsuitable accommodation.  This can be coupled with two bus rides to get their children to school every day, no proper facilities to prepare a home-cooked meal upon their return and no proper bedrooms for the children to play.  When I was working for Tusla, one of the most heartbreaking pieces that I had to deal with on a regular basis was bringing children to a family resource centre for them to have their birthday party or any type of celebration, be it communion or confirmation.  That is the reality of people living in homeless accommodation and it is completely heartbreaking.<\/p> <p> The Bill needs to be enacted as soon as possible to provide for those who may be facing eviction this winter.  The despair and fear of any family looking at homelessness this close to Christmas must be incredible.  In fact, the fear at any time of the year is appalling.<\/p> <p>Many people are saying that this is fine and that we have a short break up to the winter but what will happen after that?  The Housing for All strategy on social and affordable housing has failed miserably.  As for the statistics that were read out here today, on every metric the Government has failed to deal with the housing crisis.<\/p> <p> In the case of people who are not in breach of their obligations and who through no fault of their own have been issued a notice to quit; what are their prospects now?  What is the availability of a social or affordable home or short-term emergency accommodation in their community?  It is not likely, because the Government's housing strategy will not provide either in the short term and certainly not when this eviction Bill ends.<\/p> <p> Section 2 of this Bill allows for landlords to evict a family for overcrowding.   Again, as has already been said, this is wrong and this provision has to be removed.  When a family has initially rented the property - this happens quite often when people will be staying in the property and are quite happy to stay there - they may have a family of one, two or three children, depending on family size.  If they are on HAP, they will only be given property for one-bed or two-bed accommodation, if that is what their need is.  They may then have another child.  Those people are facing eviction now.  If an unscrupulous landlord wishes to do that, the Government has given them the get-out clause to do so.  This is unfortunate and this must be removed.<\/p> <p> I also ask the Minister of State to accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment on property holders who themselves are in danger of homelessness.  I am currently dealing with one constituent who is a doctor and who has moved back home after a number of years away.  He is currently living in a hotel and is unable to get back into a house.  We need to provide support for the person who is in the house, as well as providing support for the person who is trying to get back into their own home.  That is something that has been missed at the moment.<\/p> <p> This Bill brings a short-term solution and a small breathing space for families facing homelessness but it is not a long-term solution.  That is what I and people fear in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600036#OO00300","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666791720,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I may not use the entirety of my allotted time but I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party this afternoon in a debate that is long overdue.  As remarked upon by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, some representatives from Fine Gael were actively resisting this Bill up until recently even though it was clear to all of us that this type of legislation was needed.  The very need for this Bill in the first place is a symptom of the State&rsquo;s basic failing to house its own citizens and to house all of those others for whom the State has responsibility at present.<\/p>  <p>  This is a symptom of the Government&rsquo;s shocking over-reliance on a private rental sector and the logical conclusion of a policy that is being maintained and is leading to a situation where simply not enough social and affordable homes are being built and provided for those who need them.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone is suffering from this broken housing model.  These are young people, those going through separation and those on low pay.  The knock-on effect of a broken housing model hits us all as parents and colleagues, and the public services often have to bear the cost of this broken system presided over by the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  Nowhere is this more true than in the situation that obtains in respect of HAP tenants, as alluded to by other colleagues and, time and again, not just in the context of this debate, but this morning also in the context of the People Before Profit debate on social and affordable housing.  In a market where rents are constantly increasing, it is nearly impossible for HAP recipients to find alternative accommodation in the rental sector.  Yet they are still subject to no-fault evictions for reasons of sale, renovation or the moving in of family by the landlord.  The definition of family here is very broadly defined.<\/p>  <p>  The Simon Community recently reported that there are no properties currently available for rent within normal HAP rates.  As an experience, that is not unfamiliar to all of us operating in our constituencies representing and advocating for people who are HAP tenants and who may lose their tenancy.  This results in HAP tenants becoming homeless upon receipt of notices to quit being issued by the private landlords.  Things are now so stark that even this Government knows that an eviction ban is necessary to prevent homelessness figures from skyrocketing this winter.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear, our homelessness services and emergency accommodation services simply cannot cope.  What we saw in Dublin Airport last weekend is unforgivable for a wealthy, liberal, open democracy.  We must also be clear that it is not those fleeing war in Ukraine who are causing our housing crisis.  Let us be very clear on that point.  The housing crisis is being caused by a problem being compounded by bad Government policy; a policy it seems incapable of ditching.  <\/p>  <p>  Last month we saw a record high of homeless people, with some 10,800 individuals seeking emergency accommodation.  Among these are 3,220 children, and older people with complex health needs who never envisaged themselves to be in this situation.  <\/p>  <p>  We also have workers who work for the emergency services who sleep in their own facilities at work with no idea of where to go.  We have come across these situations of people who are working for the State.  This is completely extraordinary and is the reality behind the numbers.  These are real people living in an uncertain and often miserable situation with consequences both now and in the future.<\/p>  <p>  As the Labour Party has pointed out, an eviction ban alone will not solve the homelessness crisis.  Instead, it needs to be paired with adequate long-term preventative measures including limiting the grounds that allow landlords to evict tenants as per our Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill, which we debated a number of months ago, by reducing reliance on the volatile market of private landlordism, and by establishing a strong public housing system yet again.  We cannot apply just another short-term sticking plaster until the show moves on.  The media and others may get fixated on the next scandal.  There is always a scandal down the road and cases which are difficult to consider but many of those 10,000-odd people will still be in the same boat next week.  The measures in this Bill will certainly prevent those who are at risk of becoming homeless from doing so but will not make a single unit available on a long-term basis for anybody.<\/p>  <p>  That is why the Labour Party is deeply concerned that the grounds for eviction are not strong or strict enough in the original Act.  What we have before us today is not a long-term solution and is simply a stay of execution for many tenants who are at risk.<\/p> <p>We know and they know that, when March rolls around, the wide range of reasons for which tenants can be evicted will again be exercised by landlords.  The Minister of State knows this, as do we all, but we sometimes prefer to cover our ears, close our eyes and simply hope that the problem will go away.  As asset prices continue to rise - and house prices are continuing to rise albeit at a slower rate than over the past three years - the reality is that landlords will try to realise the value of their assets and sell their properties.  That is basic economics.  It is how this works.<br\/><br\/>We need actions rather than words.  It is vital that we take steps to restrict the grounds for eviction.  As demanded in the Labour Party amendments we will debate later on, we must prevent landlords from evicting tenants for reasons of sale unless the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>and the local authority have been offered the property first.  My colleague, the Labour Party housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, and the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage have been very clear that, when the RTB is notified of an eviction, the local authority should also be notified to ensure clarity on the situation and the demand in each local authority area.  It is incredible that this connectedness is not in place and that these systems are not networked properly.<br\/><br\/>Evictions on the grounds of overcrowding fail to recognise the nuance of the housing crisis.  While it is never ideal for people to live in overcrowded accommodation, an overcrowded home is better than no home at all.  Tenants who were forced by the inaction of the State on the housing crisis to reside in overcrowded accommodation should not be evicted and left homeless.<br\/><br\/>Landlords should only be allowed to evict a tenant to move in family members in circumstances where they are direct family members such as spouses and children.  We have seen shocking abuse of this measure in Ireland with distant third cousins and imaginary nieces being touted as new tenants, thereby providing landlords with a reason to evict long-standing tenants to free up their properties.<br\/><br\/>Fundamentally, the only way to end this vicious cycle is to increase the State supply of social and affordable housing.  Not only is this a moral imperative, as report after report has shown, it is the right thing to do financially and economically.  However, as it stands, there are more than 60,000 households being socially supported within the private sector.  This makes no sense.  Rather than investing today to solve the problems of the future, we throw good money after bad on temporary measures such as HAP, income supports and emergency accommodation.  A lot of temporary measures that were introduced a number of years ago have now been embedded in the system and are proving to be very costly.  Of course, we would like to see HAP, RAS and other measures only used on a temporary basis at a time when there is sufficient housing to meet the needs of people across the country.<br\/><br\/>Let us take HAP as the obvious example.  As rental markets spiral, HAP rates have to increase to keep up, with those State payments ending up in the hands of landlords.  It is more cost-effective for the State to acquire the housing in which the HAP tenants are <i>in situ<\/i>rather than to pay out these perpetual subsidies and supports.  This is a pure waste of taxpayers' money in the long term.  It is totally bonkers.  The direction of travel needs to change.  Tenants should be in social housing, which provides increased security of tenure as they are no longer at the mercy of landlords.  Even the targets in Housing for All will again be missed this year.<br\/><br\/>We need to return to a public housing model and the idea that this country could build necessary accommodation, even at times when we did not have the resources we have now.  That would bring much more stability to our country, improve growth and stabilise our society.  The Minister of State knows as well as anybody how much focus is now on housing, which has become a real issue across our society, and on the question of whether the political system can resolve this problem.  There is a real problem, and a real question is being asked of this Government.  To date, the performance has been incredibly disappointing and less than we would expect.<br\/><br\/>In addition to an extension of the eviction ban, we urge this Government to reduce red tape in respect of the tenants <i>in situ<\/i>scheme and to prioritise the acquisition of housing by local authorities.  The Labour Party will be proposing amendments to the Bill, which the Minister of State will have already seen, to ensure that these kinds of mechanisms to end homelessness are joint implemented alongside the overdue eviction ban.  Failure to do so will see homelessness figures rise dramatically once the ban elapses at the end of March and evictions on a staggered basis become the reality again in the middle of next year.  I do not believe the Minister of State or any of us want us to be back in that situation next March, discussing another eviction crisis.  If we can resolve the issue now, let us do so.  However, it will require a refocusing of Housing for All and more resources for social and affordable housing.  That is the trick.  That is how this will be resolved.  Let us not wait until more children, elderly people and vulnerable groups are shamefully put out on the streets of cities and towns across this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600037#PP00200","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666792320,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing this important legislation to the House in such a speedy and timely manner.  It is a sensible move that seeks to protect renters from eviction.  I acknowledge the work of Department officials in drafting this Bill and the work of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in ensuring that its provisions are constitutional, legally defensible and strike a balance between property rights and protection of renters at this difficult time for so many.<\/p><p>The Minister arranged a briefing for the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we were given the time to discuss and ask questions on the draft Bill.  It was agreed unanimously by the committee to waive pre-legislative scrutiny in order not to delay and to ensure that we can pass this law as soon as possible to protect renters.<\/p><p>I reiterate the recommendation from the committee that, where a notice to quit is issued and the RTB is notified, the relevant local authority should also be informed at that time.  That was a strong recommendation from the committee following that session.  It may not be easily included in the primary legislation but I urge the Minister of State to take that recommendation on board and to consider what is the best method for the local authority to be informed and made aware of a notice to quit and the date on which the tenancy will expire under this law, which relates to the length of tenancy, so that the local authorities can monitor and manage homelessness challenges.<\/p><p>I also ask the Minister of State to note the submission received by the Oireachtas committee from Threshold with regard to his Bill.  I am sure he will agree that Threshold is a leading organisation in preventing homelessness and a crucial source of independent information and support for those at risk or experiencing homelessness.  Threshold stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThreshold welcomes the introduction of the emergency measures contained in the Bill and commends the government for having listened to homelessness organisations and others who have been advocating for such an intervention.  The rationale for the Bill is clear and well-rehearsed, but the impact will be significant.  It will prevent homelessness for thousands of individuals during the winter period. <\/blockquote>  <p>However, there are two areas which require further consideration.  They have already been outlined by others.  One relates to overcrowding and the other to those in rental arrears.  The suggestion is that those renters who have engaged with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and who are working to actively engage on repayment should be allowed to avail of the deferred termination dates.  I ask the Minister of State to consider these suggestions.  We can discuss them on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>The Bill introduces emergency provisions that place a moratorium on evictions between now and the end of March 2023.  We are conscious of the difficult winter ahead resulting from increases in the cost of living and primarily the increased electricity and gas prices caused by Russia&rsquo;s war on the people of Ukraine, with whom we stand in support and solidarity against the weaponisation of energy supplies.<\/p><p>We are also conscious of the difficulty people experience in trying to secure alternative accommodation at this time and the great pressure on homelessness services across the voluntary, community, NGO and local authority sectors.  I take this opportunity to thank all those who work in that sector.  It is a difficult and stressful job and those people help thousands of people every year when they need it most.  I have worked with my own local authority in Wicklow and I have no hesitation in saying that the staff in the housing section do a fantastic job, as do staff in all of our local authorities.  Many go way above and beyond their job descriptions to help our constituents with their housing needs, often in emergency situations.  In order to assist those staff in our local authorities, I hope the Minister of State will consider the Oireachtas committee's recommendation on local authorities being informed of notices to quit at the time of issue.  The phased arrangements to enable affected tenancies to be terminated over a period to assist in managing demand on housing services as a result of such deferred termination also constitute a sensible measure.<\/p><p>While this Bill is a welcome measure that will provide some temporary relief for renters, the longer-term solutions are the provision of affordable rental properties of a good design and high standards under secure long-term tenancies.  I refer here to the cost-rental model.  Cost-rental is a core Green Party housing policy and I am proud that we introduced and legislated for the provision of cost-rental accommodation last year in the Affordable Housing Act 2021.<\/p> <p>That was only just over a year ago.  Despite comments from others, you cannot just switch on affordable housing schemes and cost-rental like a light bulb but we are doing so.  It is a concept that is new to Ireland but it has proven to be highly effective in the European rental sector and especially in Vienna.  We met with our Austrian Green Party colleagues prior to passing that legislation to learn from their model and to ensure that cost-rental will work for Ireland.<\/p> <p> The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage is currently going through a series of meetings with local authorities from across the country to engage with them and learn from their delivery of housing across the range of social housing provision, through direct builds, with approved housing bodies, AHBs, through affordable purchase schemes and through delivery of cost-rental directly, with AHBs and with the LDA.  The figures we received from the  local authorities are encouraging.  The pipeline of projects is strong and they are confident of meeting their targets.  They have told us they are well funded and resourced but that there are challenges caused by inflation and staff recruitment and retention.  My constituency in Wicklow has actually exceeded its social housing delivery targets.  It has just progressed its first affordable purchase scheme and in recent months I have attended the opening of four social housing schemes across the county with the Minister, and more recently in Bray with An Taoiseach.<\/p> <p> In engagement with the LDA, we have heard of its commitment to the delivery of cost-rental across its many projects.  Across ten projects nationwide, its near-term deliveries are at design, planning and construction stage and will provide over 5,000 homes.  That is public housing on public land, including affordable and cost-rental, that is secure, to a high standard of design and with good transport links.  Just up the road from me in Shanganagh they are well advanced on delivery of 597 homes.  That consists of 200 social apartments, 306 cost-rentals, 40 affordable purchase apartments and 51 affordable purchase houses.  That is one example of what the LDA will deliver.  It still surprises me to this day when I hear Opposition spokespersons criticise the LDA and not want it to construct houses, although it is possible they have changed their position by now.<\/p> <p> The legislation we will pass this week will offer a short-term but very necessary protection for renters.  It has been widely welcomed.  However, we must continue with determination and using every method available to provide housing.  We must engage with investors, large-scale landlords and smaller landlords with one or two homes.  We must invest public tax money wisely to provide the best return for our people and long-term returns on that tax money, to activate land, ensure compact growth and compact living and inject action into stalled developments and uncommenced planning consents.  We must find that spot where viability and affordability align and work with all players to deliver.  State investment must provide a return to homeowners and renters through the delivery of affordability and secure tenures.  The output must be sustainable and compliant with our carbon targets, using all available alternatives in building materials and design, bringing as many vacant and under-used buildings as possible into productive use.  We must continue do that at scale and pace with the targets set out in Housing for All.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600038#QQ00200","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666792920,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The Social Democrats will be supporting this Bill.  I have tabled a number of amendments to improve it.  It is unfortunate that there will only be 60 minutes for dealing with amendments today.  We will likely only be able to discuss one or two of the amendments rather than all those that have been submitted, which does not do the legislative process justice.  This Bill is needed fast and quick but we should have had at least a few hours to discuss the proposed amendments.<\/p><p>The reason this Bill is in front of us is because the Government's housing plan is failing.  It is as simple as that.  Homelessness is at record levels.  Rents are at record levels.  House prices are at record levels.  The number of people living in emergency accommodation for homeless people has increased by 30% in the last 12 months while the number of children in emergency accommodation has increased by 47%.  That is not to mention people living in direct provision, people fleeing domestic violence and living in refuges, people who are sleeping rough on the streets or in tents or people sleeping on couches and floors.  That is not to mention the hundreds of thousands of people who are still living in their parents' homes even in their late 20s and 30s, when they do not want to be there.  They want to be able to have some form of independence and get on with their lives.<\/p><p>I was struck by the comments the Minister made towards the end of his speech.  He said &quot;The Government will ensure that we have a rental market that is fit for purpose&quot;.  With housing, the Government is always saying &quot;We will do this&quot; or &quot;This will happen in the future&quot;.  Halfway through its term, it is still telling us things will happen in the future.  Fit for purpose for whom?  I have not heard anything from the Government to indicate that it intends to make renting fit for purpose by giving renters proper security so they are not always looking over their shoulders and worried in the pit of their stomachs about what will happen if they receive a notice to quit.  In many senses, it is that insecurity that really gnaws at people when they are renting, even if they have not received a notice to quit or have been in the place for years.  It is that worry.  Things might be going well in their lives and in their kids' lives.  Their child's development might be going well, they might be settling into school and overcoming different challenges or learning difficulties they have.  There is still that absolute worry of what will happen if they get the notice to quit.  When they do get the notice to quit, all of that kicks in and they can see the years of struggle and the progress they have been making in getting through those challenges in life unravelling in front of them.  I do not think there is a proper awareness of that in the Government.  If there was, we would not be seeing these kinds of piecemeal, emergency, reactive measures.  We would be seeing reforms brought in to make renting secure for renters, as is the case in most other European countries.<\/p><p>The Government is failing to meet its own targets on housing.  The big promise of this Government on housing was that we would be building additional supply and new supply.  The number of social homes in the housing delivery targets for this year and last year were nearly all meant to be additional homes.  That was the big promise.  We were promised 9,500 new-build additional social homes last year.  Instead we got about half of that number.  We were promised a couple of thousand affordable homes from the Government last year but we got zero affordable purchase homes.  We were promised 350 cost-rental homes but only got 65 of those were tenanted.  For new build social housing delivery this year, less than 2,000 homes were delivered in the first half of the year when there were 9,000 additional new build social homes promised.  For affordable purchase and cost-rental accommodation, in both categories we only have a few hundred delivered so far this year, when we need thousands of those to meet the Government targets.  Indeed, we need a lot more than that to meet demand.  Not only that, but somehow the Government is not even spending its full capital allocation on housing.  That is scandalous given the situation we are in.  It is 30% behind its own targets at this time of the year.  If that is made up towards the end of the year, rather than the shortfall being made up through building a sufficient number of new builds and additional supply, it will be made up the way Governments have always done it, by buying up existing supply towards the end of the year to try to meet its targets.  It is certainly better than not doing that but it is the additional supply that really is needed.<\/p><p>The Government has spoken about needing these emergency measures for breathing space but there is no sign of what its plan is for that breathing space.  Regarding the tenant in situ scheme, I am very concerned about the <i>ad hoc<\/i>and haphazard way it has been implemented across the country.  It varies from local authority to local authority and even within local authorities we are getting mixed messages about how it is being implemented.  I appreciate that it is a new scheme but the Government could give more direction to local authorities on that.  That would be useful and is something the Minister might look at urgently.  I agree with the points made by previous Deputies about local authorities being notified of notices to quit.  That would be useful, especially in terms of local authorities being proactive about potential purchases.<\/p><p>There is no question that the social housing limits must be raised.  All of us are aware of situations where people who have been on housing waiting lists, who are on low incomes and cannot afford to meet their housing needs themselves are being knocked off housing waiting lists because they have gone slightly above the thresholds.  I know of people in my constituency who did overtime during Covid when others were out sick just to keep production going, in food production and so forth.<\/p> <p>They got knocked off the housing waiting list because their earnings went above the threshold because they were covering for people through once-off overtime and once-off sickness leave due to Covid.  Others, who have got small pay increases from their employers to meet the cost-of-living crisis are also getting knocked off the social housing waiting lists.  This is a brutal thing that is happening to people, including those who had been on the waiting list for a long time and who were close to having homes allocated to them.  They will never be able to meet their own housing needs because the Government has not moved those thresholds up, at least along with the cost of living and inflation.<br\/><br\/>What happens to people when they do get a notice to quit?  It causes absolute devastation, stress, anxiety, and disruption in their lives.  Their very first thoughts are about the rest of their family.  They are thinking about their children who may already have been suffering with anxiety and mental health issues.  Having a notice to quit, where they will be evicted from their home and uprooted from their friends, their family, their GAA clubs and anything else they are involved in with the local community, has a devastating impact.<br\/><br\/>It must be said that such evictions are not normal practice.  This is not what happens in most European countries.  In most European countries, it is simply not legal to evict renters who are paying their rent simply because the landlord wishes to sell.  They cannot do it in other European countries.  It is totally against the law, be it one house or 100 apartments together.  It cannot be done.  One cannot do this in Austria, Belgium, or the Czech Republic - and we had a delegation from the Czech Republic visiting the Oireachtas today.  One cannot do this in Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, or Romania.  What is it that we think it is okay or that the Government thinks it is okay for it to happen here?<br\/><br\/>I welcome this Bill as a temporary measure, but if Ireland was in line with most other European countries, we could not even bring in such a temporary measure, because in those other countries it is permanently in place that one cannot evict people who are paying their rents from their homes simply because the landlord wants to sell.  If the landlords in those countries want to sell, then they go ahead and sell, and there is not a problem.<br\/><br\/>We must also recognise that with increased property prices and the value of homes, properties, and landlord properties, a lot of that value is given from public investment and public infrastructure.  Much of the value of housing and the value of homes is because of the roads that have been put in, the water infrastructure, the wastewater infrastructure, community facilities, public transport and so forth.  That gives a lot of the values.  It is not simply the case that this is a private asset that has gone up in value simply from the hard work of the person who owns the property.  Much the value has gone in from public investment, not to mention the public subsidies through HAP and so on, which inflate rents and which also increase the values of homes, including the value of those homes from which people are being evicted.<br\/><br\/>I want to reference some of the amendments I have tabled for the Bill.  Before I do this, however, I implore the Minister and the Government to look, in addition to this, at what immediate measures can happen to protect people for example like the tenants in Tathony House, where more than 35 households are being evicted.  This is 100 people, an entire block, facing mass eviction.  The Tyrrelstown amendment, which was brought in some years ago supposedly to prevent these mass evictions, is not working.  There are too many get-out clauses in it and loopholes that can be exploited.  If the Government is looking at emergency measures to stop people being evicted then it should be looking at that and closing down those loopholes.  Ultimately, the Government needs to get out of emergency measures and bring in long-term reform.<br\/><br\/>I have some sympathy for landlords who complain about all of the constant legislative changes.  This is not the way to reform the sector.  We need one set of changes that bring in proper security for renters.  We must stop messing around in the sector with incremental changes causing haphazard, piecemeal changes.  We must bring in proper long-term reforms that give stability to the sector, and then there does not have to be multiple changes to legislation each time during the year.<br\/><br\/>Before I discuss the amendments I have tabled for Committee Stage, I must mention the concerns that have been articulated about the Bill by the Irish Traveller Movement.  The measures will not protect Travellers from being evicted from temporary accommodation, which is something they had flagged previously. This is specifically relevant in the context of the Irish Traveller Movement noticing an increase in the number of queries and cases they are dealing with around evictions.  It is particularly relevant because, as we are aware, Travellers were particularly over represented in homelessness in 2019.  We do not have complete figures on this but we do have the figures for 2019, when 25% of children in emergency accommodation outside of Dublin were Travellers and 13% of homeless adults were Travellers.  This is a complete over-representation for the Traveller community.  Their particular concerns around this should be noted and taken onboard by the Government.<br\/><br\/>As previous speakers stated, there should be a requirement for the local authority to be notified of notices to quit at the same time the RTB is notified.  This would potentially assist in the context of tenants <i>in situ<\/i>and with the acquisitions by the local authority.  This would provide some time and would potentially take some of the stress out from tenants who are caught in the middle on this.  Tenants are incredibly vulnerable when they receive a notice to quit.  They are being put in a position where they are not clear what their role is between themselves, the landlord, and the local authority.  An acquisition is a very stressful situation for them to be placed in.<br\/><br\/>With regard to allowing evictions on the grounds that the property is no longer suitable, this should be withdrawn. Threshold has made the case that they have seen an increase in the use of this ground for evicting people.  It makes no sense.  Threshold argues, for example, that a family with a new child might be evicted into homelessness on these grounds.  That does not help anyone.  They have argued very strongly that the moratorium should at least be extended to include people being evicted on those grounds.  I support that.  Threshold has made the case that if this ground is to be retained with regard to overcrowding, for example, then there should be some basis for that such as confirmation from a fire authority that the dwelling is no longer suitable.  Threshold also made the point that there needs to be enhanced support for those who are in rent arrears.  I have also tabled an amendment on the undermining of tenancy rights that have accrued due to the length of tenancy.<br\/><br\/>I have tabled amendments in respect of the removal of sale as one of the grounds for eviction.  As stated, this is simply not possible or legal in most European countries.  I do not see why the Government will not support that.  If the Government removed that ground, it could be a game changer for giving renters more security and giving stability into the sector, but also very importantly in reducing the number of people being evicted into homelessness.  Even Boris Johnson, when he was UK Prime Minister, had promised to bring in a ban on no-fault evictions.  It was not a temporary ban.  It was to be a ban on no-fault evictions.  Boris Johnson was, in my view, a terrible leader of the Conservative Party.  I cannot think of much that he has done or promised to do that is commendable, but he was backing that as a measure.  If the Conservative Party can talk about doing that, then one would think that this Government could at least do it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600039#RR00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666793520,"counter":285,"content":"<p>It is one and a half years since the Minister ended the Covid-19 eviction ban.  Since then, homelessness levels have increased almost every single month.  We all take having a roof over our heads for granted, but imagine waking up tomorrow to find out that you were going to be made homeless?  That has been the reality for 78 families so far this year in Kildare who are tenants in receipt of HAP.  I have spoken to many of them.  They come into the office in shock wondering how they can keep their family home, keep their kids in school, and get to work.  There is a crisis in homeless accommodation, so much so that families have been sent from Kildare to Roscommon for emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>That is 170 km, a two-and-a-half-hour drive and far from schools, support networks and places of employment.  It is a scandal.<\/p> <p> There are almost 11,000 adults and children in Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage-funded emergency accommodation.  This includes 1,483 families with 3,220 children.  The Government might say they have a roof over their heads but their childhood is being stolen from them.  Can the Minister of State imagine trying to prepare food for a family while helping with homework and dealing with day-to-day family issues?  It is hard enough in a three-bed semi-detached house.  Imagine what it is like in homeless accommodation.<\/p> <p> Families in direct provision are also being deprived of their dignity.  They are human beings the same as me and the Minister of State, and we need to treat them with respect and allow them to play their full part in society.  I help people in emergency accommodation daily.  It is clear the stress of such an existence - and all it is for them is an existence - is having a huge effect on their mental health.  They all say homelessness was something that happened to other people until it happened to them.  We can and must do better.  A home is not a product to be bought and sold for profit but a place of safety, security and privacy.  People are not just losing that home.  Homes are being taken from families by vulture funds and greedy institutional landlords.<\/p> <p> I send my solidarity to the more than 100 residents living in an apartment complex in Dublin who face possible homelessness.  The tenants of Tathony House, a 35-apartment block in Kilmainham, received eviction notices last Wednesday.  The Government needs to step in and support the residents.  The eviction ban worked during Covid but only delayed the problem.  As soon as the ban ended, the floodgates opened.  Unfortunately, the Government did not take action.  It did not use the breathing space to build homes or introduce a credible plan to address this crisis.  The Government transfers almost &euro;2.5 million per day in taxpayers' money to private landlords to meet social housing need.  It is doing more harm than good and needs to step aside so this crisis can be addressed once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600040#SS00200","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666794120,"counter":287,"content":"<p>This whole \"step aside\" thing is not, unfortunately, how democracy works.

That is what commentator after commentator has costed and analysed.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the legislation before us.  It is positive legislation and protects vulnerable people from November until the end of March.  It should be subject to review thereafter because we saw during Covid that those who are less well-off and who are penalised by paying the highest rents in our country are put to the pin of their collar and are at the whim of landlords.  We have seen excellent landlords, but also unscrupulous ones.  This gives protection to people who, through no fault of their own, face eviction.  There is a sunset clause in the legislation, of course.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation also protects landlords.  We have had people from both sides of this argument contact our offices.  There are worried landlords who have seen properties trashed or rents not being paid.  There are protections in this legislation for such people, but most important and central to the legislation are those who are vulnerable and will struggle to have a roof over their heads and have struggled so for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  Inroads are being made and on Monday the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, was in County Clare officially opening 153 new social housing units.  That is delivering on housing and there is much more to come.  If anyone saw the RT&Eacute; news on Monday night, County Clare is one of several counties that are ahead of all expectations and of their own aims and thresholds.  They will exceed it by 2026.  That is not to clap backs but there is a rhetoric time and again that needs to be challenged.<\/p>  <p>  In the spirit of this eviction ban, another group of people is very pressed at the moment.  That group comprises small business owners, coffee shops and small retail.  They face huge electricity and heating bills and overheads.  I argued in the Chamber earlier that, just as we bring in this legislation to protect tenants, we should put a moratorium on and defer the revaluation of commercial rates for small businesses.  It has been devastating for some of them in the past week in County Clare who faced a 33% commercial rates hike, on top of electricity and gas bills etc.  Budget 2023 did an awful lot to support those people, but it will be taking with the other hand if we allow these increased rates to go ahead.  It is in the same spirit of helping people over these difficult few months.  We were able to defer commercial rate hikes during Covid and the same should happen as we face this new crisis in the cost of living.  Many small businesses face an existential crisis and the sensible and prudent thing would be to defer it.<\/p>  <p>  Counties are bundled together for revaluation processes.  Clare is in with Galway, Mayo, Donegal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  People in those counties who have taken the plunge, gamble and risk to enter small business now face a hike in revaluation bills of 33% or up to 40% on what they faced heretofore.  Revaluation does not happen every few years.  The last revaluation in County Clare took place in 1862.  If we have not had to tackle it from 1862 to 2022, I think we can kick it a little further along the road.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation before us is positive, progressive and has my full support.

It has been dragged by pressure from the Opposition, by the growing housing movement, which will be seen on the streets again from 26 November with the Raise the Roof protest, and by the rising homeless numbers and the political pressure that puts on the Government.  In that context, the Government says the thing it said was definitely not constitutional before is, all of a sudden, constitutional but, even when dragged and forced to do it, it cannot help but do it in the most minimal way possible, stitching in as many loopholes as it can for landlords to jump through.<\/p>  <p>  One loophole, incredibly, is that in a cost-of-living crisis there is no protection for tenants who lose their jobs and are unable to pay.  In the discussion around this in the media before the Bill was published, the Taoiseach and others spoke about those who wilfully refuse to pay not being protected but that is not what is contained here .  This is not just about those who wilfully refuse to pay but anybody who cannot pay.  Those who have an inability to pay are not protected and can be put on the streets this winter.<\/p>  <p>  Another loophole concerns those who have already been served their eviction notices.  I spent time in a woman's house the Monday before last.  She got her eviction notice for that day.  She is a young woman with four children and is in college studying psychology.  She had tried everything to find somewhere else to stay but was unable to, like so many people, so I advised her, as others did, to overhold and tell the landlord she would not leave and make herself and her four kids homeless.  She stayed there.  The landlord is relatively understanding and said he will not try to evict her again before Christmas but, legally, there is nothing protecting Stephanie and her kids from eviction over this winter despite the fact the Government is introducing an eviction ban.<\/p>  <p>  The other group not protected are those who have received notice now for later on, for example, the eviction notices given to the tenants of 35 apartments in Tathony House, Dublin 8, affecting about 100 people living in the block.  The landlord says \"I'm selling it\" and has issued a notice to quit for the start of June.  One renter, James O'Toole, has said he is terrified to go back into the rental market in Dublin with the limited supply available.  He has lived in the building since 2009.  Many other tenants are similar.  The occupants are looking to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to enforce the Tyrrelstown amendment, because it is a mass eviction, to stop it.  However, there are loopholes in that amendment.  The landlord is claiming, and this is a very rich landlord by all accounts, that preventing this mass eviction would cause hardship to the poor landlord.  Therefore, the landlord is seeking to mass evict these people.  The residents are not taking it lying down.  They are protesting outside Dublin City Council on Wood Quay a 3 p.m. this Saturday, 29 October.<\/p> <p>In particular, I call for the council in that situation and in Stephanie's situation to buy these properties and prevent people from being made homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600041#TT00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666794720,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The Government has been forced to introduce an eviction ban.  Over the past four years, People Before Profit has brought in four different Bills proposing eviction bans.  The Government has argued against them.  It has dragged its heels and resisted.  It put up every argument as to why it could not happen and why it was problematic constitutionally, but when sufficient pressure came on, it was forced to introduce it, but, as Deputy Murphy said, in the most minimalist fashion possible.<\/p><p>One of the groups that will suffer as a result of the minimalist approach taken by the Government are people who have already received and past their termination date.  Deputy Murphy gave one example and I will give another: a couple and their two children, whose termination date was last Friday week from a home the parents have lived in since they were born in the 1950s.  The landlord has multiple properties.  They are not suffering any financial hardship.  One can only speculate as to why they are selling but I think it is fair to say that, given the number of landlords who are selling up and evicting people consequently, that it has something to do with the extortionately high level of house prices at the moment.  Landlords are cashing in and they are doing that precisely on the Government's failure to deal with the housing crisis.  Why do property prices go up?  They go up because there is a shortage of housing.  The worse the housing crisis gets, the more the property of landlords and large property owners is worth.  That is the way it works.  The more they can charge in rent, the higher the price they can command when they sell.  When they think it has reached the peak, they sell and they do not care about the human wreckage they leave behind, in this case by evicting a working family with two children where the parents in this family have lived in the house since the 1950s, because they are cashing in and that is allowed.<\/p><p>I pointed this out here last week.  I was the first person in the D&aacute;il to point out that the Government's eviction ban did not protect them.  There was not a word in response to that from the Government.  Even though it was flagged on several occasions, there was nothing in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to explain why that gap has been left.  There is simply no justification.  Worse again, what will every single local authority housing section I know of tell anyone who is facing an eviction and has passed their termination date, given the authorities have virtually no emergency accommodation, if they have any at all, and no social housing to offer most of the people in that situation, and there is virtually no affordable housing?  What does the State tell people to do in that situation?  It tells them to overhold.  It is an unspoken but all-pervasive policy.  It is not just Deputy Murphy, I and other Deputies who tell people in these situations they have no choice and they will have to overhold but local authority housing departments are also telling them they have to overhold because those departments  have nothing for them.  However, the Government is not going to protect those people with this Bill.  How can the Minister of State justify that?  I just do not understand.<\/p><p>We have tabled an amendment on this but, of course, the Government has guillotined the debate tonight so we probably will not reach it.  In any event, our amendment was ruled out of order on the basis it represents a charge on the Exchequer to extend the eviction ban to those who have already passed the termination date.  I was scratching my head when I heard that one.  How is that a charge on the Exchequer?  That was done during the Covid eviction ban which the Government was also forced into introducing after weeks and weeks of pressure.  How is that a charge on the Exchequer?  I would really like somebody to explain that to me.  Therefore we cannot debate that amendment and vote on it tonight although we probably would never reach it because the Government has guillotined Committee Stage to 60 minutes.  Families are terrified and have nowhere to go.  They are all searching <i>daft.ie<\/i>, <i>myhome.ie<\/i>, ringing up the place finder section, which is in an equally despairing and hopeless situation, looking for rental properties, and there is no emergency accommodation available for them, but we are not going to protect them.  It is flipping outrageous.<\/p><p>The duration of the ban is also outrageous, given the situation. It will end at the end of March.  Some of the protections may last until the summer but then we will have thousands of people facing eviction again.  It has to be extended for a year at least, as again we are proposing in an amendment.  Frankly, it should be extended for the duration of the emergency.  The D&aacute;il officially declared a housing emergency in 2018.  Again, it was forced to do that because of the Raise the Roof protest when there were 10,000 people out on the streets.  People Before Profit put forward a motion on behalf of the Raise the Roof campaign.  Finally, after denying it for about five years, the Government conceded there was a housing emergency.  If there is a housing emergency, there is no question that we are constitutionally protected in taking emergency measures.  I do not buy for one minute the legal arguments the Government used to try to justify not doing that.  We have done it before when the Government said we could not, and we are doing it again now.  There is an emergency, declared by this House, and that gives the Government the legal constitutional basis on which to protect people from being driven into homelessness.<\/p><p>Most disgustingly, every single child who is made homeless is going to be marked for life.  The Government is lucky that in the case of the family I mentioned, they do not want to talk to the media because the parents are terrified their children will be humiliated in school.  That is the situation of so many of these families and that is the situation the Government is putting them in.  The mental health of children is being put on the rack because they are facing the humiliation of being made homeless.  There should be absolute protection against that and it should last until we provide them with alternative, affordable and secure accommodation.<\/p><p>Could we do that in the period of the duration of this eviction Bill?  Not on the current policy trajectory of the Government, but would it be possible to make a significant impact over the duration of this eviction ban Bill?  It would if the Government were willing to do certain things.  First is that it would actually do something about vacant and derelict properties.  For example, in my area, there is a building called Kelly&rsquo;s Hotel.  It is owned by the council.  It has been empty for around 20 years.  I do not know how many times I have brought it up in this Chamber or with the council.  At one stage the council wanted to sell it.  We kicked up enough of a fuss to stop that.  Now it is just sitting there empty.  It is perfectly suitable to house people in.  Nothing happens.  It just sits there.  There are Ukrainian refugees desperate for accommodation.  There are people 20 years on the housing list.  There is no homeless accommodation available in the area.  Kids and families are sent into hostels in town when they are going to school in Ballybrack, Sallynoggin or Shankill.  It is flipping outrageous that the State itself is sitting on empty properties.<\/p><p>I will mention Tathony House again because if the Government does not do something about that, then the same thing will happen there as happened in St. Helen&rsquo;s Court.  Landlords try to get around the Tyrrelstown amendment, but even if the RTB asserts they cannot do that, the tenants themselves are so stressed that they start to leave.  They will be forced out because of the pressure, anxiety and stress.  That landlord, with a &euro;700,000 a year rent roll, is claiming he has the right to evict people on the grounds of financial hardship.<\/p> <p>Can you believe it?  Can you believe the venality and greed of a landlord who would do that to people?  Some of the tenants will leave and then the properties will be vacant.  Then the landlord can do exactly what a vulture fund does.  I refer to an Irish vulture fund.  The landlord of Tathony House is an Irish landlord evicting people, one of our so-called own.  When tenants leave, a landlord can sit on empty properties, as was done in the case of St Helen's Court for three years.  There are 17 empty properties, and the State allows it to happen.  It does not take them over.<\/p> <p> The Government currently gets 10% of most new private developments.  It is a pathetic figure considering that house and rent prices are such that about 70% to 80% of people in the Dublin area could not afford them.  The State is getting only 10% of new builds.  All the rest will be rented or sold at prices that ordinary working people could not possibly afford.  Why do we allow that to happen?  Most of the developments in question are on sites that were previously in the ownership of NAMA and that the developers bought from that agency at a major discount.  Often they make massive capital gains out of selling these properties.  They do not even pay capital gains tax on them in many cases because of the tax loopholes they benefit from.  To me, it is obvious what you do in that situation.  You do what they do in Finland, for example.  In Finland, 25% of any new development has to be social housing and 30% has to be affordable housing.  Therefore, 55% of any new development has to be social and affordable housing.  One might ask why, in the current situation in Ireland, anything less than 100% should not comprise social and affordable housing.  In all seriousness, what is the point of building housing that is not affordable?  There is none.  The State and the buyer or renter get screwed for massive amounts of money.  What is the point in that?  The State should buy 100% of the developments.  Admittedly, that would be at a cost but there is a way it can be got back.  A windfall tax could be applied to the capital gains the people in question will make out of the sale.  One could take the money back off them.  They should not have got it in the first place.  The greatest scandal ever in this State was the disposal of the NAMA property to them.  They should not make a cent out of it.  We should acquire 100% of the sites and tax the windfall gains made by the developers so we can get the money back.  In this way, we would start to have a serious impact.<\/p> <p> If those who live in south Dublin drive down the N11 on their way to Wicklow or Arklow, they will see all the apartment complexes being built in the region, some of which are near completion.  Currently, we are getting 10% of them.  We should be getting at least what the Finnish get in Helsinki, namely, 55%.  I would say it should be 100%.  The State should buy the complexes and then it could solve the problem.  Cherrywood, the biggest residential development in the history of the State, is on what was NAMA-owned land.  As things stand, the beneficiaries will be foreign investors, including Dutch pension funds.  They will rent at extortionate levels and sell at extortionate prices that nobody can afford.  Now there is pressure on the banks to start lending money to people that they cannot really afford, with interest rates going up.  Believe it or not, we are actually threatening to do what we did before 2008.  There is an alternative.  It is for the State to take the property back, buy it all out and deliver it all as affordable and social housing.  We built the infrastructure with the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  We have paid for the roads and parks with public money but private investors will reap the benefit.  What we are doing is just insane.  The solutions are in front of us if we are willing to take the necessary action.<\/p> <p> My last point, which I am making yet again, is on income thresholds.  As our motion pointed out today, in 2008 some 48% of households were entitled to social housing or eligible to go on the social housing list.  The ESRI points out that because of the Government's failure to increase the thresholds, that was down to 33% by the end of 2019.  That means it is well below 30% now.  This is happening when more households than ever need the support because house prices and rents have gone up.<\/p> <p> There has been a massive stealth cut to the proportion of households eligible for State support.  You will not even get social housing because you will be on a list for 20 years, but at least you might get housing assistance payment, HAP, support as an interim, temporary measure.  If you are over the threshold, you are goosed.  The Government support is very clear about the reason for the delay in raising the thresholds.  It states it has to ration social housing.  The word \"ration\" appears on about 20 occasions.  That is what it is down to.  It is not down to justice or anything like that.  Precisely when people need assistance more than ever in accessing housing, the proportion of eligible households has been dramatically cut.<\/p> <p> The reason the Government does not want to do what I suggest is because it does not want to acknowledge the scale of the problem.  However, one does not solve a problem unless one acknowledges it and how many people actually need State support through the delivery of social and affordable housing and, at a minimum, financial assistance to secure housing they can afford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600042#UU00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666795320,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I welcome the eviction moratorium, which will provide greater security for tenants and prevent families and individuals from entering homelessness and emergency accommodation, as it did during the Covid pandemic.

To be able to provide comfort and security to many households fearing eviction is very welcome.  However, we know the measure is a temporary one to provide temporary relief.  In many cases, it is simply pressing pause on the inevitable reality.<\/p>  <p>  At the centre of Green Party housing policy are affordability and security.

Ongoing measures are being implemented and should continue until we find ourselves in a position akin to that of Finland.  Finland's example is one we can follow.

Only this week, people contacted my office in Cashel because they had nowhere to go after their tenancies ended.  One case involves a single mother and her children.  This family just cannot find accommodation in a market that is strangled through a lack of supply.  The mother, who has tried all the local estate agents in an effort to get a house, had to sleep at her neighbour's over the weekend and is now in contact with the council about emergency accommodation.  How long is she going to be in emergency accommodation?  How suitable will it be for her and her children?  What impact will it have on the children's well-being and education?  This is the situation that so many people throughout the country are finding themselves in.  My party and I will support this Bill because we are talking about people's well-being.  We are talking about maintaining for children a life that is as normal as possible under the current circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The figures show the sheer number of people, of families, who are facing challenges.  Since the last ban on evictions ended, the number of adults and children in emergency accommodation has increased to 10,800, according to the August figures.<\/p> <p>That is not an exhaustive list, as it does not take account of the women and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence refuges, the adults and children who are trapped in the direct provision system and are using it as emergency accommodation, nor the adults and children who are in hostels that are not in receipt of State funding.  Neither does it include those who are sleeping on people's sofas or those families crammed into a spare box room in a friend or relative's house.  This is where we are.  This is where the Government has led people, by failing to deliver an adequate supply of social and affordable homes.  The situation will continue for as long as the Government continues to plan for too few social and affordable homes.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for months for a ban on evictions during the winter.  While the Government may have been initially reluctant to do this because it may force it to admit to the failings of its housing policy, it is obvious that the realities facing thousands of people and families has finally hit home.<br\/><br\/>This is not a reason for the Government to sit on its laurels, because although it is a much-needed measure, it will not fix the problem.  If urgent action is not taken to increase the supply of social and affordable housing over the next five months, we will be revisiting the crisis in April.  We need more action on voids and on purchasing homes with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.  While Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting this Bill and has called for something similar for months, we will be tabling amendments.  For instance, we do not support the provision in the Bill to allow for terminations to proceed where the property is overcrowded.  This could put large and vulnerable families at risk of long stays in emergency accommodation and could also be used as a loophole for those who cannot proceed with terminations on grounds such as the sale of a property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600043#VV00300","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666795920,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Canney and Verona Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600044#WW00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1666795920,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I will support the Bill's progress on Second Stage today.  Over recent months the cost-of-living, energy and housing crises have meant that people are making choices between paying their rent, paying energy bills or having money to put food on the table.  People are being sacrificed and to add to their worries, there was a significant jump in the number of landlords selling up.  There was a substantial increase in the number of notices to quit in the private rental sector in the past year.  It increased by 47% between the first and second quarter of 2022, from 1,132 to 1,666.  Tenants are in constant dread and fear of eviction where the landlords have significant power over their lives.<\/p><p>The RTB operates a register of private tenancies, as well as resolving disputes between landlords and tenants.  This Bill is required due to the ongoing acute supply constraints in the residential rental sector and the increasing number of people presenting as homeless over the winter.  I welcome the fact that the Government wants to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants within the residential tenancy market.  This temporary measure will protect renters who face homelessness by deferring any no-fault tenancy termination from taking place this winter until after 31 March 2023.  Where people are in financial difficulties as a result of the cost-of-living and energy crises, they should be protected if they fall into arrears.<\/p><p>One young mother from my constituency contacted me because she is in fear of imminent eviction.  She was recently given notice to vacate in the new year.  Although she has been searching, she cannot locate an alternative property, with hundreds vying for the same properties in Louth.  This extension is very welcome to her as she needs time to locate a new place to live for her and her family of four.  Thankfully, most renters will be protected under the new moratorium, including students.  However, it must be noted, rightly so, that it will still be possible to serve a notice of termination during the winter period and this protection will not extend to a tenant who chooses not to pay his or her rent or who is in breach of other tenancy obligations.  This is fair and offers the landlord protection also.<\/p><p>While this emergency Bill is necessary and provides assistance in the short term, the long-term answers to the housing and accommodation challenges remain.  The Government pitches the Housing for All plan as the proposal to alleviate the housing crisis.  It promises an increasing supply of new housing, with an average of at least 30,000 new units per year.  The promise of social and affordable homes for purchase or rent aims to eliminate homelessness and to address waiting lists, yet homelessness is at a record level, additional people are queuing down the street for a room, people are being priced out of buying a home and nearly half of people's wages are being paid in rent.  The homelessness figure will continue to grow after the eviction ban has concluded unless the core problem of the lack of social and affordable homes is addressed.<\/p><p>Last week, the Union of Students in Ireland co-ordinated a students' walk-out in protest at the lack of accommodation for those attending further education.  The Government must listen to these students.  The market has failed to deliver accommodation for those renting and seeking to attend college, with many choosing to stay in hostels or to sleep in cars or even in tents rather than face a long commute each day.  Because Louth is located along the commuter belt, my office has received numerous calls from students from across Ireland in search of accommodation.  I will not say the Government has done nothing but it must do more.<\/p><p>The housing crisis is felt in every part of the country.  In my constituency of Louth, we have a severe housing shortage and spiralling rents.  The latest figures from <i>daft.ie<\/i>show that the cost of renting in County Louth has risen by 8% in the past year.  The average rent is now at &euro;1,420.  Letting agencies on the ground have painted a devastating picture of the current rental market with a shortage of supply that has hit all age groups and walks of life.  In Dundalk and Drogheda, the rental crisis is catastrophic as thousands of people are vying for only a handful of homes.  We must do whatever we can to keep families in their homes as a matter of urgency this winter.  I fundamentally agree with the principle of a person having access to housing and, as such, I agree with the passing of this Bill.<\/p><p>The number of people being made homeless is unreal.  Not a day passes without someone coming into my constituency office who is in that situation.  It could be due to a husband and wife separating or someone in the home who has an addiction and their parents cannot put up with them any more.  I commend the homelessness section in Louth County Council.  We seem to have a hotline to it.  We ring it nearly every day and, in fairness to them, its staff do their best.  Many of the homeless people who come into my office have an addiction problem.  The emergency accommodation is a good place to go but most of them refuse to go there because they maintain there are drugs available in them.  This is something we must examine, given the amount of money the Government is spending on emergency accommodation.  If there is a problem with drugs in them, then we will have to examine it seriously.<\/p><p>A young girl came to see me recently who has a problem with alcohol.  She is only 18 years of age.  Her parents threw her out.  I rang the parents and they did not want to do anything with her.  I contacted my local homeless centre and they told me the girl has a serious drink problem and she was in the Simon Community hostel but they threw her out because was drinking again.  She came back to see me.  Where does this young girl go from here?  Nobody seems to want to know anything about this young girl - neither the HSE nor the mental health services.  She is only 18 years of age.  She slept for three nights on top of a new Halliday Mills apartment block on Quay Street in Dundalk.  She slept at the top of the building because she felt safe there at night time.  I keep ringing and asking how come this young girl is forced to sleep rough.  The system does not work right.  If we ring the psychiatric unit in Crosslanes in Drogheda, we are told a person must be referred by a doctor or consultant.  If you go to the doctor, the doctor will give a few sleeping tablets.  This young girl is caught in the middle.  She feels as though nobody wants her.  My main concern at the moment is what is going to happen to her.  She keeps calling to the office and we keep ringing up on her behalf but I am afraid that some day this wee girl will not come in and she will be found dead.  The system is failing drastically.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Health should be working together to help the likes of this young girl.  I will contact Louth County Council tomorrow and let them know that I spoke to the Minister today.  There is no way that society should be like that.

Why is that, if the economy was never stronger and employment levels are so high?  NAMA is part of the answer.  It was initially sold to the public as a system that would save the housing market by warehousing loans, but instead this changed midstream and those loans were sold to vulture funds, resulting in the utter collapse and devastation of the housing market in Ireland.  Ruined developers were made bankrupt at every turn.  The skilled workforce they employed left for greener pastures, never to return.  Whatever the spin doctors say about developers, it was not the builders and developers that caused the housing collapse, but they are part of the solution, if they were only listened to by the politicians.<\/p> <p>I uttered those words on the floor of the D&aacute;il in March 2020, just after I was elected.  Here is a little more of what I said at the time:<\/p><blockquote>\tChange means looking at and introducing current macro-prudential rules, not applying rules of another era.  Can we consider a mortgage interest rate cap?  As we hear every day, banks are making excessive profits.  Can we simply legislate to equate multiples of borrowing to the current interest rates, not ten year old interest rates? <\/blockquote> <p>Irish banks were flush with money and we had a regulator that could only be described as asleep at the wheel.  Today, two and a half years since I uttered those words, we have a regulator who has woken up but it just a few years too late, as he decides to increase the multiples house buyers can borrow but with their ability to repay greatly reduced because of a cost-of-living crisis and at a time when interest rates are rising at speed.  I return to my 2020 maiden speech:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe main people now facilitating the building of properties are the cuckoo funds which, as we know, pay no taxes but the optics are that we are building.  We will never be able to break free of the rental limbo this Government has put us in nor will the affordability crisis ever be over unless we change how we do things.  That means taking decisive action that works. <\/blockquote> <p>Today, optics and spin are not what it is about.  It is about policies that work.  It means strong leadership and standing up and being counted when faced with officials who will not listen, like a regulator insisting on the implementation of regulations and measures that reduce viability, such as dezoning lands, even serviced lands.  It is just mind-boggling.<br\/><br\/>Let us not forget that for every new build, the Government takes a tax of 33%, yet rather than reducing VAT on new builds to zero, like our nearest neighbours in Northern Ireland, and encouraging building and affordability, it attacks people's property rights.  An eviction ban is necessary only because of the disastrous attitude to housing of this Government and previous Governments.  We should not forget that Ireland was the only country that closed its building sector during Covid.  Instead of taking actions to encourage building, the Government has increased the cost of doing so with a block levy, that is, a lifelong levy for the innocent to pay, whereas those who were responsible or had been tasked with the oversight ride off into the sunset laughing at the fact they got away scot-free.  The Government is making sure that housing is unaffordable for those most in need, first-time buyers, by introducing a levy.  These are sticking plasters.  There is not one big idea coming from the Government with regard to housing.  Scheme after scheme is announced with no evidence they increase the supply.  There are no meaningful actions.  Where is the LDA or Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe?  It is nonsense, all spin.  There is no one in the county councils to carry out the inspections.  All of them are afraid to make a decision.<br\/><br\/>On 6 July 2021, there was a debate in the House about a ban on rent increases.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, closed his remarks by stating:<\/p><blockquote>\tThere is no single, silver-bullet solution to rents.  There are many solutions and a multifaceted approach is required.  That is what the Government is doing.  A realistic way of dealing with this would be to assess, over a 12-month period, how the measures we hope to pass tomorrow night, with the support of Deputies across all parties and none, are taking effect.  We must have a proportionate response that is not going to impact on supply in the market. <\/blockquote> <p>I challenge any member of the Government to explain how the situation is better than it was in July 2021, when those comments were made, after all the interventions made by the Government.  Is it that the Government now believes a ban on no-fault evictions is a silver bullet?  It is time to admit that the Government and the housing Department are out of their depth.  They are out of ideas and now they are out of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600044#WW00500","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666796520,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  I will preface my remarks by declaring my interest in that I am a landlord and I have some properties we have rented.  If we keep demonising landlords who are renting out properties in the way we are doing, we will find we will be in bigger trouble than we are right now.  I understand there are about 500 properties in Galway that are up for sale where notice has been given and the tenants are local authority tenants.  There is something wrong when that is happening, and it is not greed or anything like that.<\/p>  <p>  People forget that many landlords are accidental landlords.  I know of someone who bought a home but had to relocate for their job.  They rented out their house to be able to pay their mortgage while they were renting somewhere else.  They will not be coming back to the house now because they have moved permanently to another location.  They are trying to sell the first house in order that they can buy a house in their new location but they cannot get the tenant out of the house, having been trying for two and a half years.  There are two sides to every story and I am not saying every tenant is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP scheme, as it stands, is totally alienating landlords.  If a landlord has a rogue tenant who refuses to pay his or her portion of HAP to the local authority, the HAP office will not pay any rent to the landlord, leaving the landlord without his or her rent and leaving the tenant with a free house that costs the State nothing.  Going through the process of notification, validation and all that goes with that can take a couple of years.  There has to be a reality check in what we are doing.<\/p>  <p>  Why are we bringing in legislation to ban evictions over this winter?  It is a reflection of where we are with our housing.  Policies are failing.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is proving to be a major struggle for local authorities.  I have been dealing with a constituent who has been waiting since August to have an inspection carried out.  He could not wait any longer to get the builder in or he would miss the opportunity to do up a house to live in.  He is one half of a young couple.<\/p>  <p>  That is a disservice and it is not the local authorities' fault.  They were handed this scheme as a panacea to help bring vacant properties back into use.  It was a very good idea, except that nobody asked how we would help the local authorities to manage the scheme on top of all the other schemes we are foisting on them.  Next week, or whenever the Minister issues his directive following his announcement at the ploughing championships that he was going to extend the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme to rural areas, how are the local authorities going to deal with that?  How are they going to carry out the inspections?  They will not be able to do it.  We will have created an expectation, with applications going in, but there will be nobody at the other end of the phone to say when an inspection will be carried out.  There will be nobody to say whether the application is right or wrong.  We will just have another bunged-up system.  If we are real about doing things and putting things right, we have to put money in place to run the scheme and resource the local authorities, if they are what we are going to get to do it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows about the next issue because he was notified about it.  A housing scheme in my constituency has been boarded up, despite being almost complete, because there is a technical planning issue, which has now gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a judicial review   Most of the houses were going to the local authority and the local authority itself deemed that the application was invalid.  It beggars belief what is going on.  I have been dealing with another housing scheme, which the Minister has visited, and it is almost complete.  It is a great scheme with beautiful, well-built houses but it is waiting for Irish Water to connect it.  That is another fiasco.  Developers cannot install the connections themselves.  They have to get the contractor that has been nominated by Irish Water, and that is driving the price through the roof.<\/p> <p>I had a case of a person who was building his own house and had to bring water 150 m along a public road.  This person could not do it; Irish Water had to do it.  The cost for doing it was &euro;60,000 for a single house.  Let us get real.  What is going on is madness and nobody is calling it out for what it is.<\/p> <p> Every gateway of approval is being put in place for procurement for local authorities trying to deliver housing schemes.  There are maybe seven or eight gateways of approvals.  Why not trust the local authorities to deliver the housing the Government wants to deliver and that is so badly needed?  Why does it not devolve the money to the local authorities and ask them to deliver it?  Every time they look for approval, it takes three to six months.  These approvals create layer upon layer of bureaucracy, as well as jobs and costs that are not really necessary.  We have to get real about this.<\/p> <p> At one time, we had an agency called the National Building Agency, which we got rid of.  It was able to build houses and work with the local authorities.  It was able to get things done.  It had the expertise to do it.  We do not have that expertise within the Department or in the local authorities because we got rid of it all.  We said we do not need to build any social housing.  We need to get something going in terms of a crack unit that will tackle this problem head on, cut out all this trash in the middle and free up the system so we can actually build houses.<\/p> <p> There is talk about rapid building and how we build our houses.  I can tell the Minister of State now from my own experience that the easiest thing to do in this world is build a house.  If we get a contractor on site, we will get a product at the end of it.  It is the gap in between deciding to build something and getting to the stage of having a contractor, however, that will take four, five or six years of procurement, reports and whatever else.  Let us get real.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600045#XX00200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666797120,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Like everyone else here, I know of a number of people whose tenancies have recently been terminated through no fault of their own.  They are facing into a winter of uncertainty.  Of course, I welcome any attempt to keep families in their homes and provide them with security.  For families who feared losing their tenancy or perhaps felt a notice to quit was imminent, this will buy them time and eliminate the worry of eviction in the coming months.  It also buys the sector time to increase delivery of new homes; something to which we are absolutely committed.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised my concerns previously in this Chamber that a rent freeze and eviction ban could lead to a similar situation to that experienced in Berlin, where things got worse for tenants after measures were introduced because the supply of rental properties dried up and landlords left the market.  We have a very constrained market here in Ireland.  We must guard against those potential unintended consequences at all costs.  We need to give tenants certainly and security.  That is the absolute bottom line.  We will not achieve that long-term security for tenants without bringing landlords along with us, however.  That is why I would personally favour also introducing measures that support landlords and keep them in the market because that is how we keep tenants in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is aimed at addressing Ireland's overall housing supply challenge but we know the private renal market has now become an acute crisis.  Small-scale landlords are exiting the market.  At the same time, there is a need for an additional 6,500 rental properties annually, according to the housing needs and demand assessment.  Owners of one or two rental properties represent 86% of registered tenancies.  Preliminary data from the RTB survey of landlords show that taxation is a major factor for exiting the sector.  Notwithstanding the various protections for tenants, it is clear that extra steps are required to stem the exit of landlords from the private market and most importantly, to support renters who are paying high rents that are often more than a mortgage would cost.<\/p>  <p>  Tax is the one area in which a quick market response can be encouraged.  I am not talking about institutional landlords.  I am talking about the 86% of landlords who have one or two properties.  I am talking about the mom and pop landlords and accidental landlords.  I am talking about helping to keep them and their properties in the rental market.  How can we do this?  We need to give them fair tax treatment.  It is my belief that tenants should get a dividend from any tax reduction landlords receive.  There are two goals here.  First, we need to keep landlords in the market so tenants have a place to rent.  Second, and most crucially, we need to reduce rents for renters.  I welcome the tax credit for renters that will give couples back &euro;2,000 in tax in the next few months. I am glad that is now being extended to parents who pay rent for their children if, for example, the children are students.  I believe we need to do more for renters but we also need to do more for landlords.<\/p>  <p>  We should look at capital gains tax and at providing some form of relief on property sold, acquired and retained as rental accommodation, including an appropriate clawback for a five-year period.  This would give flexibility and incentive for landlords to enter and stay in the market to deliver homes for people.  It needs to pay to be a landlord and it needs to cost less to rent.  Landlords need to stay in the market and tenants desperately need security.  While I welcome this Bill, we need to be even more innovative.<\/p>  <p>  On the topic of banning evictions, I want to mention those who are overholding because they have nowhere to go.  I ask the Minister of State to look at their particular circumstances too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600046#YY00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1666797120,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I echo the comments of Deputy Higgins.  To expand on that, I am of the view that while the tax treatment of a small landlords, the very large proportion of whom own one or two properties, is fair, in a progressive taxation system any additional income they make from it should be taxed appropriately.  The unfortunate reality, however, is that they are leaving the market in droves.  That is causing evictions to take place, which is putting good people out on the street in the midst of a housing crisis.  The reality is that we must do something.  We can support tenants but we can also support one-off small-time landlords, if you want to call them that, to stay in the market because they are the ones who are exiting the market.  Even my colleagues on the benches opposite would agree that something must be done to increase the supply of rental properties.  If we do not do anything, it is evident that more people will leave the market.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is to be welcomed.  I also welcomed the eviction ban in the midst of Covid-19.  We are in a crisis of a different type but it is a crisis, nonetheless.  This Bill offers the breathing space for tenants up and down the country to ensure their tenancies can be maintained throughout a difficult period.  I would say, however, that perhaps a matter that should be discussed at the housing committee, on which I am very much aware Deputy Higgins serves, is the length of the ban.  It should be discussed by all parties and by the Minister because I do not think we are going to be getting out of the rental market crisis in March or April of next year.  I believe it will go on for some time and on that basis, further consideration should be given to ensure those who are in vulnerable tendencies are supported.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All, of course, sets a path for 300,000 new homes between now and the end of 2030, including more than 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable homes and most importantly, in the context of a discussion on rental, 18,000 cost-rental properties.  That is something to which we must aspire.  However, I would be wary of the impacts Covid-19 and, of course, the war in Ukraine have had on construction costs and any potential slow-down that might arise from that.  I was pleased to note the Minister of State saying that social housing supply will show progress in quarter 4 of this year.  I certainly hope that can be sustained.  A point I wish to reiterate in the last few moments of my contribution is that we should keep a close eye on commencements across the State and be prepared to act swiftly to support the construction sector should commencements start to decline.  That would be a very worrisome trend in the housing market, should it arise in 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600046#YY00400","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1666797120,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Many struggled through the pandemic dealing with illness, loss, isolation and grief but for others, it was a lifeline.
