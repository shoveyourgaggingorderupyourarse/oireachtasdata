I thank the committee for the opportunity to address members today on issues within our area of responsibility.  I know the committee has had a number of interesting contributions and sessions to date and they have given rise to a number of issues that fall within the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I hope we can address as many of those as possible today.<br\/><br\/>At the outset, I would like to say a few words about Project Ireland 2040, which the Government launched earlier this year.  Project Ireland 2040 is the overarching planning and investment framework for the social, economic and cultural development of the country.  It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the period 2018 to 2027, which is the &euro;116 billion national development plan, NDP, in support of a long-term transformational spatial strategy, the national planning framework, or NPF, with a time horizon out to 2040.<br\/><br\/>The aligned and shared vision of the NPF in tandem with the NDP represents a joined-up planning and investment strategy for Ireland's future growth and development, focused on a series of ten shared national outcomes.  Foremost among these is climate action and the national objective to transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society<i><\/i>by 2050.  Policy that will assist in making that transition and meeting our climate obligations is woven through the NPF and NDP.  Shared outcomes reflected in both documents that are fundamentally supportive of climate action include compact growth, sustainable mobility and sustainable management of water, waste and other environmental resources.  All include significant elements of policy that provide a strong platform for the development of measures and actions in response to climate change.<br\/><br\/>The overall NPF strategy seeks to achieve a better balance of development between the regions, a greater focus on cities, supporting the rural fabric and targeting more compact growth in the development of settlements of all sizes, from the largest city to the smallest village.  The benefits of compact growth are that it can bring new life and footfall to the cores of our cities, towns and villages, contribute to the viability of services, shops and public transport, add to housing supply and enable more people to be closer to employment and recreational opportunities, as well as to walk or cycle more and use the car less.  Along with minimising transport demand, higher densities and shorter travel distances will also reduce energy demand and use.  Multi-storey and terraced buildings in close proximity require less energy and make renewables-based systems of energy distribution such as district heating, more feasible.<br\/><br\/>The EU Circular Economy Package indicates that in a circular economy, a cascading use of renewable resources should be encouraged, together with its innovative potential for new materials, chemicals and processes.  This circular economy approach is also applicable to land use management.  Through compact growth, the NPF effectively sets out recycling rates for the reuse of brownfield land by requiring 40% of new housing nationally, to be built within infill and brownfield lands and encourages reuse of existing building stock.  The extent to which we prioritise compact growth, brownfield over greenfield use, encourage the use and reuse of buildings in urban and rural areas, and reduce sprawl, will assist in increasing the efficiency of land use and contribute to meeting emissions reduction targets.<br\/><br\/>The NPF identifies the need to progressively electrify our mobility systems, moving away from carbon intensive propulsion systems to new technologies such as electric vehicles and the introduction of electric and hybrid traction systems for public transport fleets, such that by 2040 our cities and towns will enjoy a cleaner, quieter environment, free of combustion engine driven transport systems.<br\/><br\/>The NPF also supports transition to a circular bioeconomy, where the value of bio-based products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible, and the generation of waste minimised.<br\/><br\/>Central to the NPF is a recognition of the need for energy efficiency and for new energy systems and transmission grids that will be underpin a more distributed, renewables-focused energy generation system.<\/p><p>This will provide a basis for harnessing the considerable onshore and offshore potential from a range of energy sources such as wind, wave and solar and connecting the richest sources of that energy to the major sources of demand.  In particular, the national planning framework, NPF, states that the development of offshore renewable energy is critically dependent on the development of enabling infrastructure in order to bring the energy ashore and to connect into where it is needed most.  <\/p><p> The Department is currently undertaking a review of the 2006 wind energy development guidelines.  The review is addressing several key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections.  As part of this work, a strategic environmental assessment is being undertaken in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive No. 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA directive.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced in the coming weeks with the aim of issuing the finalised guidelines in early 2019 following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase.  When finalised, the revised guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  <\/p><p> My Department, in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment which leads on renewable energy policy, is exploring the potential for enhancing national planning guidance on solar energy, taking account of solar energy projects being assessed by planning authorities and the scope for future development of the sector in the context of the ongoing development of renewable energy policy.  Further to this ongoing engagement between the Departments, should the need for specific planning guidance for solar farms be identified, this work will be further scoped and progressed.  <\/p><p> The NPF highlights the role that Ireland&rsquo;s forests and peatlands can play in climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration and the provision of renewable fuels and raw materials.  Irish forestry is a major carbon sink and afforestation is the most significant mitigation option that is available in terms of land use.  <\/p><p> On climate adaptation, the NPF makes clear that as an island it is in our interest to ensure we respond to climate change and its impacts such as sea level change, more frequent and sustained rainfall events and greater vulnerability of low-lying areas to flooding.  In particular, the NPF makes clear that flood risk assessment is now critical in planning for future development due to rising sea levels.  In the long term, climate change adaptation responses may entail the consideration of barrage or similar technologies to prevent inundation of lower-lying city centre areas during extreme weather events.<\/p><p> In summary, in order to contribute to achieving transition to a low carbon, climate-resilient society, the NPF provides a strategic framework to link planning, development and investment to climate mitigation and adaptation through influencing transformational change in the pattern of development and settlement by securing more compact growth; supporting resource efficiency and the circular economy; facilitating greater energy efficiency, the development of renewable energy systems and infrastructure and a more diverse energy mix; and ensuring that mitigation and adaptation measures are embedded in the operation of the planning system.  It is important to note that the NPF is a national strategy, which integrates a range of cross-cutting objectives.  Implementation of the NPF will require shared responsibility, with lead roles across many Departments and agencies.  <\/p><p> On future investment, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently reviewing all technical factors relevant to the appraisal of capital schemes.  This will include changes to the public spending code with regard to methodologies for the evaluation of the likely costs of carbon emissions and benefits of climate change mitigation.  This work is expected to be published in the coming weeks and will include a period of public consultation.  The principal measures proposed include new methodologies with the potential to impact on project prioritisation.  <\/p><p> In Ireland, approximately 40% of total energy produced is used in the building sector.  The energy performance of buildings directive sets ambitious goals for energy efficiency and renewables in buildings by requiring nearly zero energy building, NZEB, performance for new buildings from 31 December 2020.  In addition, the directive also requires that major renovations to existing buildings are completed to a cost-optimal level where feasible.  The implementation of NZEB is a key action for the built environment in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s national low carbon transition and mitigation plan.  <\/p><p> On what we are doing to achieve NZEB in new dwellings, we have progressively updated standards relating to the conservation of fuel and energy in dwellings over the past decade with the aim of improving the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to NZEB performance levels.  As a result, the final step on the NZEB journey is not as significant as it might otherwise be.  Many of the techniques introduced in 2007 such as mandatory renewables for new dwellings and more energy-efficient boilers have effectively eased the transition and minimised the additional costs and effort required at this stage to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.  We will shortly publish an update to Part L of the building regulations to achieve these NZEB performance requirements in dwellings.  When implemented, it will represent an improvement of 70% in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standards for all new dwellings commencing construction in 2019 subject to the necessary transitional arrangements.  <\/p><p> A modelling and cost study was carried out to estimate the cost impact of NZEB.  When the uplift in cost was calculated for a range of common heating systems, renewables, and ventilation systems, the range was 0.7% to 4.2% over current construction costs for typical new dwellings to achieve NZEB, depending on the dwelling type and design specification applied.  The average uplift in cost across all dwelling types modelled was 1.9%.  When compared with the energy savings to the occupants over the lifetime of the house, this delivers real value, benefitting people&rsquo;s lives by bringing comfort and convenience, mitigating against energy poverty and ill health as well as providing the societal benefits of lower carbon emissions.  Under the current regulations a typical new dwelling is built to an A3 building energy rating, BER.  The NZEB requirements will equate to an A2 BER.  As I stated, this represents a 70% improvement in energy efficiency and a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 2005.  It also introduces 20% renewables as a percentage of the total building energy use.  <\/p><p> The NZEB requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from traditional fossil fuels.  A Central Statistics Office analysis of building energy rating data demonstrates this shift away from fossil fuels.  The installation of oil boilers has dropped from 36% to 6% in new dwellings and electrical systems make up 35% of heating systems in new dwellings, with this percentage growing steadily each year.  Part L regulation is set at cost-optimal levels and is performance based and technology neutral.  The availability of a choice of energy systems delivers economic benefits including competition and choice for consumers.  It is a matter for the designer to choose the most suitable technologies to achieve the required performance.  The cost-optimal calculations are reviewed every five years and regulations will be amended if performance levels deviate from cost optimal.  This regular assessment and flexibility provides opportunities to capture in regulations the benefits of innovation and economies developed in industry over time.  It is estimated that the cumulative improvements to regulations mean that a dwelling built to the 2011 Part L regulations requires 90% less energy than an equivalent dwelling built in 1978 to deliver the same standards of heat, hot water and light.  This shows the very significant progress that has already been made in the standards for new buildings.<\/p><p> The challenge is inevitably more difficult in regard to existing buildings.  The energy performance of buildings directive requires that where buildings are undergoing major renovation, the whole building should be brought up to a cost-optimal level insofar as is technically, functionally and economically feasible.  The cost-optimal level of performance is the best energy performance that can be achieved in a building for the lowest lifetime cost when both capital costs and operating costs are accounted for over a 30-year period.  Our technical guidance documents provide detailed guidance on how this can be achieved in practice for buildings undergoing a major renovation.  The performance levels have been set to be proportionate to the original cost of works and ambitious but realistic so as not to create an unintended barrier to renovation.  Of course, building regulations will not increase renovation rates in themselves, but they will ensure that when renovations are carried out, they are carried out to this level, which will be typically equivalent to a B2 energy rating.  <\/p><p> On social housing, funding of approximately &euro;116 million was provided from 2013 to the end of 2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000 local authority homes.<\/p><p>In addition, energy efficient measures have been incorporated into the over 9,000 vacant social housing units that have been returned to productive use since 2014.  This effectively means that approximately 50% of our social housing stock has been energy retrofitted.  While energy efficiency activity had traditionally been focused on the refurbishment of vacant properties, the current energy retrofitting programme, launched in 2013, is aimed more broadly at the social housing stock, in particular to improve the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building, in order to improve comfort levels and address issues around fuel poverty.  This programme has two phases.  Phase 1 focused on the lower-cost improvements such as cavity wall and attic insulation.  Phase 2, which we will move to shortly, will target higher-cost measures, for example, fabric upgrades and glazing.<\/p><p> Turning to buildings other than dwellings, NZEB and the requirements for major renovations were introduced for non-residential buildings in November 2017 through an amendment to Part L of the building regulations.  These new performance requirements improve the energy performance by in the order of 60% and introduce mandatory renewables on all new non-residential buildings.  These regulations apply to works to new and existing buildings which commence after 1 January 2019, subject to transition arrangements.  In advance of publication we went through an extensive public consultation process and regulatory impact assessment in early 2017.  As part of that, we worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills, the Office of Public Works and health services bodies, as well as many construction industry bodies to develop, elaborate and introduce the regulations and guidance.<\/p><p> A new element of the revised energy performance of buildings directive, EPBD, is the provision of infrastructure for charging electric vehicles.  Lack of recharging infrastructure is seen as a barrier to the take-up of electric vehicles in the European Union and the revised EPBD has new provisions which aim to accelerate deployment.  The EPBD requires the provision of appropriate enabling infrastructure for all new buildings and buildings undergoing major renovation with more than ten car parking spaces by 2020 and, in addition, the installation of the actual recharging point is required in the case of those non-residential buildings.  By 2025, it requires the installation of a minimum number of recharging points for existing non-residential buildings with more than 20 parking spaces.  We are in the process of drafting these regulations and will publish them for public consultation in 2019.  We are consulting the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and the National Standards Authority of Ireland in this process and will have the regulations in place by March 2020.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the Department will continue to work hard on all of the measures I have outlined, notwithstanding the other challenges we face in terms of building up our national housing stock.  We have ambitious targets for the quantity, type and location of homes to be delivered and we are also ambitious for climate action.  We will ensure that the quality of the homes we are building for future generations continues to achieve the high standards we are setting for decarbonising our built environment. <\/p><p> I and my colleagues will be happy to address any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

We welcome the move away from fossil fuel heating systems to more energy efficient heating.  What will Part L of the building regulations provide in respect of future-proofing our heating systems, particularly in new homes that are now being built?  What is the likelihood of these homes having to be retrofitted in upcoming years in order to meet new standards?  Deep retrofitting has limited scope at the moment.  What are the Department's plans for expanding on that?<\/p> <p>  On non-residential buildings like schools and hospitals, the committee was told a number of weeks ago that for new schools built today, the Department of Education and Skills has determined that the most suitable heating system is oil.  That is under technical guidance document TGD033, which was only issued by the Department this year.

I will answer them to the extent that I can.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would take the lead in rolling out local government capacity in terms of functions such as those that the Tipperary Energy Agency discharges.  At a broader level, we have macro-level responsibility for the local government sector, while other Departments take the lead on particular issues.  At a very broad level, as is reflected in the policy document on local government reform published in 2014, we certainly see local government expanding its role in community development and local development, which would encompass things such as local energy initiatives of this kind.  However, the specific energy-related dimension is something on which the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would lead in terms of engagement with individual local authorities.<\/p> <p>  On Part L and the requirements for new residential developments, as I outlined, we have come a long way on the journey towards nearly zero-energy buildings as far as the residential sector is concerned, through changes that were made over ten years ago.  We are very much guided by NZEB and what it requires us to do to complete that journey.  We are at a very advanced stage and will shortly finalise the new Part L provisions that will provide for us to get that remaining part of the way along towards NZEB.  That will deal with new homes and also with the issue of retrofitting.  I will ask one of my colleagues to say a little more about that in a minute.<\/p> <p>  On the approach on which the building regulations are based, I mentioned in my opening statement that they are and have always been performance based.  They set the standards that are to be achieved and it is then left to the designers and promoters of developments to work out the best technology to achieve that.  On the impact of the regulations and the changes that were made in 2007 and subsequently, we can trace that the performance-based approach has led to significant change.  That approach will be reflected in the revised Part L regulations when they are made.<\/p> <p>  The policy on offshore energy is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but I think the question was more about the legislation.  That is complex legislation which we have been working on in collaboration with a number of other Departments for a long period.  At the moment we are awaiting legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  We expect to get that shortly.  How quickly we will then be able to bring the legislation forward will dependent on what that legal advice tells us.  We are very alert to the fact that the legislation is hugely important in terms of ensuring that there is an appropriate consent regime in place for the expected development of offshore renewable energy which we expect to see in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Sarah Neary, to say a few words on the approach in the building regulations, particularly in respect of the performance-based approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As the Secretary General has said, the building regulations are performance based around energy efficiency and CO2 emissions.<\/p><p>In setting standards, we are technology neutral.

As Mr. McCarthy explained, that is a life-cycle cost which takes into account the capital and operational costs over a 30-year period.  Mr. Armstrong is involved in producing cost-optimal figures on a five-year basis.  They show, in cost-optimal curves, the point at which our regulations should be set.  Currently, that point allows a number of forms of heating system to be used, for example, gas boilers, photovoltaic solar panels and heat pumps.  These would meet the CO2 emission and energy performance requirements under Part L because they take into account costs over the capital and operational periods.  Given the volume of houses and other buildings currently required, keeping a broad supply chain available is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Is it a question of capital and operational costs as opposed to carbon emissions or is it a balance?

They are possibly the most advanced performance requirements in Europe.  We are slightly ahead of the curve, and the rest of Europe will be following us in the next 12 months because we are all working to the same directive.

It is great to have them here.<\/p> <p>  Given the Department's role in respect of local government and its policy remit, it is an important player in this debate.  Mr. McCarthy explained in detail how the planning of our cities and towns was going to be key and that building 40% of new housing on infill and brownfield sites would be required to proceed.  Speaking as a public representative, that is an important initiative that needs to be driven forward.  Will the Department get that support from the elected members of local authorities?  Most of the 40% will fall under the remit of county development plans and, consequently, local councillors.  How will the resistance in some cities and towns to high-rise developments play out for the Department's proposals?  Members of some local authorities are anxious about high-rise developments, so this obvious issue needs to be addressed.  Should legislation determine how county development plans are drafted or how would Mr. McCarthy go about ensuring brownfield sites in cities are developed and, if appropriate, developments go upwards?<\/p> <p>  Part of Mr. McCarthy's presentation was on solar farms and the lack of associated guidelines.  Will he elaborate?  I took a considerable interest in the large number of solar farm applications that had been granted in recent years in my part of the world.  There is a lack of planning guidelines.  There seems to be a reluctance on the part of Mr. McCarthy's Department and that of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, to get involved in drafting and proposing such guidelines.<\/p><p>We have guidelines and renewed guidelines for the wind energy but we do not seem to have guidelines for solar farms.  Whether it is for a community that might have an issue with a solar farm or for the developer, we must consider security of tender because a gap exists.  Perhaps the Secretary General will clarify the following.  Does he believe solar farm guidelines are important?  Does he believe that we should seek clarity in that market?  If so, does he think a body of work will be done?<\/p><p> Amazingly, there is a proposal to build 500,000 units between now and 2040, which is a very significant sum.  As one will have seen from the budget yesterday, the local authority element will be a considerable part of that development.  I presume that the Department is proposing that there will be an exceptionally high energy standard for those units.  How long does the Secretary General think it will take local authorities to retrofit the entire housing stock of 136,000 local authority houses and bring them up to standard?  It will take a considerable body of work and finance to retrofit 136,000 units.  Where does he see that project fitting into the proposals?  Is there a timeline for the project?  <\/p><p> Electric cars is a significant issue.  The Secretary General mentioned electric cars and the appropriate infrastructure towards the tail end of his speech.  In 2010, a programme to provide 1,000 charging points for electric cars was rolled out.  Will legislation be invoked to ensure charging points are included in planning permissions?  There is a vast sum of money attached to local government and local government developments at present.  I am not aware of any social housing or formal housing project that has charging points attached.  Where does the Secretary General think the Department's guidelines, planners and engineers will be involved in any plans received?  If there was a plan to build a local authority housing estate in Cork tomorrow morning, would the Department insist that one of the qualifying criteria for planning permission be the installation of electric charging points?  Should the local government section and local authorities take the initiative and ensure we have so many electric charging points per housing estate?  I believe that we should have such core infrastructure and ensure it is attached to planning permission.  If the local government does not provide such infrastructure then it is very hard for developers to do so.  When does the Secretary General propose to move that kind of technology and infrastructure into the existing housing stock?  By investing a significant amount of money in such infrastructure would show leadership.  Significant developments, and I mean Part VIII planning permissions, have been granted throughout the length and breadth of this country but we have not seen much infrastructure to allow for charging points.  I ask the Secretary General to clarify these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#E01300","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I shall answer the questions in order and I might call on some of my colleagues to answer as we work our way through them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the NPF, as the Senator has rightly said, the ambitions of the NPF are significant in terms of what it seeks to achieve around how we plan for future development.  It is very clear that the framework aims to deliver a pattern of development that differs from what we have had so far and I suppose it has a disruptive element.  Obviously the framework is a high-level national strategy.  The two next critically important pieces of the jigsaw will be the regional spatial and economic strategies, which are being worked on by the three regional assemblies at the moment.  The strategies will likely go to public consultation in all three cases within the next few weeks.  When those are adopted they, in turn, will guide the adoption of city and county development plans.  It is really to try and ensure that there is a cascade from the centre to the regional and to the local, and that it all makes sense at the end of the day. <\/p> <p>  As the Senator rightly said, when it comes to the regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, and then to city and county development plans, they are for the elected members to adopt as part of the democratic process.  I am sure, and I think there are already, in the context of RSESs, quite a few debates going on and that is as it should be.  If the NPF is designed to try to deliver a different form of planning and development into the future, it would be a bit worrying to some extent if there were not debates of that kind going on.  I have no doubt that such debates will continue on through the consultation process on the RSESs and down to city and county development plans.<\/p> <p>  In terms of high rise units being part of the plan, there is high-rise and high-density development.  Certainly, in many areas where we have planned and developed over the past while, we have come a long way in terms of higher density without necessarily going very high-rise.  One can achieve a lot in that space by good and imaginative design. <\/p> <p>  The consultation period has just finished for new guidelines on heights for apartment developments and I expect the guidelines will be finalised shortly.  I will not say where they will land because we are considering the responses received as part of the public consultation process.  There are choices and decisions that must be made if we want to deliver an Ireland in 2040 in the planned way mentioned in the NPF.  It does have to differ from the way that it was done heretofore, which presents challenges around density and high-rise issues, and the use that we make of brownfield sites.  <\/p> <p>  Ultimately, one would hope that the process through the RSESs and the city and county development plans would get us to where we need to be.  I am around long enough to know that difficult situations arise.  There are times when ministerial powers of direction must be considered and, sometimes, deployed.  We will just have to see how things progress with the work that is under way.  The level of ambition and future way of planning is hugely attractive.  I hope that the city and county development plans will recognise and reflect that in due course but we will have to see how that goes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The Secretary General has great faith in elected members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#F00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I fundamentally believe in democracy, Senator.  People have genuine concerns and issues but the debates that are taking place reflect a sense that people want to get their heads around what these things mean.  We will see how all of that pans out.<\/p> <p>  In terms of solar farms, we are talking to the Department of Community, Climate Action and Environment on the issue and specifically, as part of that Department's renewable energy roll out, whether the need for planning guidelines is something that we need to act on.  We tend to roll out planning guidelines sparingly enough in the overall context.  Certainly, when one considers other jurisdictions and the extent to which they issue planning guidelines from the centre, we tend to do them for very specific issues and types of development.  As I said in my opening statement, we have to go through that process with that Department, and if the outcome of that process is that there is a need for consistency and guidance on how those types of developments are dealt with by individual planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, then we will engage with that need as we have on other areas.  We are trying to finalise the wind energy guidelines, as I referred to at the start.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the housing ambition, the Senator was correct to say that the figure is over 500,000 new homes.  That is how many units the national planning framework considers will be required over the period to 2040 and the figure takes account of the population projections that are in place.<\/p> <p>  In terms of social housing, I outlined at the start the ambitious performance-based requirements that we have in place already through Part L of the building regulations.  We will accelerate the requirement further once we finalise shortly the revisions to those regulations that are necessary in order to get us the final part of the journey towards nearly zero energy building, NZEB, performance.<\/p><p>Social housing developments will have to comply in the same way as any other housing development.  Local authorities have a reasonable track record in coming forward with proposals, sometimes ahead of time, that are almost as good as demonstration projects.

It is in no one's interest for local authorities to say that something takes two, three or four years while we say it does not.  To deal with this, we recognised when we put Rebuilding Ireland in place that we were moving from a situation where local authority house building had virtually ground to a halt and we needed to move and ensure we could move from that situation to delivering the ambitious build programme for which Rebuilding Ireland provides.  To position ourselves to do that, we agreed a programme with the local authority sector and that takes us all the way from the first thought of a social housing project to getting on site.  We have mapped it versus best practice in private development, and it is a period of 59 weeks from first thought to getting on site.  When we have spoken about that, I have heard some people saying that it takes 59 weeks for the Department to approve a project.  When I say 59 weeks, I mean that is 59 weeks to design it, take it through the Part VIII process, take it through procurement, and get on site.  There are four stages within that period of 59 weeks, and for each stage we have made commitments on how long projects will be with us.  Of the 59 weeks in total, a project is with us for 15 weeks, and the remaining 44 weeks is for the design work by the local authorities, the Part VIII process, which takes a number of weeks of public consultation, and the procurement, which takes time.<\/p> <p>  From all our points of view, and I think the local authorities share this perspective now, our key requirement is that we have that timeline in place and adhere to it in order that we can push projects.

The committee would have had some discussion on this with colleagues from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment when they were before the committee.  They lead in the climate agenda, on the mitigation action plan and on climate adaptation.  From our perspective I have no sense that a lack of interdepartmental engagement is a barrier.  Colleagues here are in different interdepartmental groups.  There are a range of interdepartmental structures for how we work together, including in the climate sector.  Some colleagues here are on some of those interdepartmental structures.  It is evident from some of the conversation today on renewable energy that we have major engagement with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment around the plans for offshore development and what that means for us in terms of the regulatory regime we need to put in place.  We have talked to Senator Lombard on solar and what we might need to do from a planning point of view for the roll-out of solar infrastructure.  Again, that is with Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, we are active in interdepartmental engagement.  I suppose it is more the knottiness of some of the issues rather than lack of engagement.  Sometimes that is the nut that needs to be cracked.<\/p> <p>  I might move on to the national planning framework and then I will come back to the other issues because they are similar in a sense.  The national planning framework and the national development plan together fall under the Project Ireland 2040 umbrella.  As part of the implementation process the Government agreed to put in place a delivery board.  The board is co-chaired by me and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which leads on the national development plan.  The board is comprised of all Secretaries General of the Departments that have a role in implementing the national planning framework and in delivering on the national development plan.  That structure has been put in place and is now up and running.  The board has met on four occasions.  The board reports back to Government and the relevant Cabinet committee.  The intention is that it will produce an annual report to show the work it is undertaking each year in delivering on the national planning framework and the national development plan.  For example, one thing we have been looking at in the early meetings is the issue around the regional, spatial and economic strategies that I discussed with Senator Lombard.  These form the crucial next steps in taking what the national planning framework aims to achieve and cascading it to regional level before it moves on to local level.  Representatives from the three regional assemblies have been in to talk to us about the work they are doing as part of the cascading exercise.  Again, it is all part of the process of trying to ensure that the various pieces of the jigsaw are in place and slotting in together as needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>We had asked earlier whether we could get a copy of the first report from that forum.

Alternatively, an engagement specifically on climate issues and which would be promoted could be broadcast each month or on another basis.

This is an important opportunity for the committee to try to deal with some of these issues.<\/p> <p>  On electric vehicles, did Mr. McCarthy state that from 2020 all new developments containing more than ten dwellings must have charging points in place?  Will that come into force on 1 January 2020 or 31 December 2020?  On a related matter, are there plans or is there work under way to retrofit charging points into hospitals, local council offices, Government buildings and departmental offices such as those of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?<\/p><p>It is probably best if I ask all my questions now.  On another planning issue regarding solar and wind energy, Mr. McCarthy stated:<\/p><blockquote>It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced in the coming weeks, with the aim of issuing the finalised guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in early 2019.<\/blockquote><p>This has been going on for years.  The witness was in that Department with Mr. Phil Hogan when he was the Minister.  I was my party's spokesperson on that brief.  Former Deputy Pat Rabbitte and a few other Ministers have come and gone since then.  Can nothing be done?  What is happening here - and I have told the Minister this - is that the door will be closed after the horse has bolted.  The wind farms that should not be built have already been built.  We need wind farms but there are some bad examples, particularly in the midlands.  These wind farms have been built without proper guidelines, not to mind regulations, being in place.  It has already happened.  I met representatives of the ESB last Friday to discuss a number of matters, including this one.  They said, in respect of the development and roll-out of wind farms, that the grid is almost up to capacity in some areas.  There are parts of the country where there will be no more wind farms.  The show is over, and without having the necessary guidelines in place.  I could see this happening and I am on the record for saying it month after month to Minister after Minister.  I am taking this opportunity to put the question to the officials.  For God's sake, will somebody try to get those in place?<br\/><br\/>The offshore element of wind energy generation has been much more costly up to now, but there is new technology.  Some countries are using floating wind farms.  In England, Scotland and Wales, 8.5% of total generation comes from offshore wind.  In terms of our research, what is the current position on moving into that space?  Obviously, we have an advantage because Ireland is an island nation.  Some people in the engineering profession claim that we could export that offshore wind energy to France, for example, given that we will soon have the Celtic interconnector.<br\/><br\/>I will move to the subject of housing.  The witness referred to the 59-week process and the four stages.  Within those four stages, there are 19 stages.  They are on the list circulated by the Department to local authorities.  I do not have a copy of it with me.  It is in my briefcase in my office.  There are a number of steps.  I will take the example of the scheme in Portarlington, the 22 houses at Ballymorris.  It took three and a half to four years from conception to getting them built.  Local councillors and officials are frustrated with this and one can imagine what it is like for the people on the housing waiting list.<br\/><br\/>I will put something that puzzles me to our guests.  When I drive to Deputy Pringle's county, I see houses along the way that are very similar in design to the houses in my county.  They were all built in the period from the 1930s to the 1960s.  I have talked to officials and engineers in the local authorities about one of the things that is slowing down the process - it would turn one's hair grey quicker than mine is already turning - which is the fact that every house has to be designed from scratch.  I accept that this is not the 1930s.  People had no technology then whereas we have now.  Some of the officials will be familiar with Conniberry Way in Portlaoise.  The houses there fit into the category of being nearly zero-energy structures.  I have been in them and they are top of the range.  One could heat them with a candle even in freezing weather owing to the standard to which they were built.  I give full credit to everybody involved in that project.  Why can we not use that design?  I am told by the engineers in the county councils that what is causing one of the problems is the design for energy.  Can we not take that template and use it in Donegal, Offaly, Waterford, Dublin, Mayo and elsewhere?  We could have three or four basic designs.<br\/><br\/>Those who want social and affordable housing will be okay if there are 700 or 800 people in another county living in similar looking houses.  It will not keep them awake at night.  It certainly will not keep me awake at night and it should not keep anybody here awake at night if we are getting people housed instead of tripping over them sleeping on the street outside this building.  Unfortunately, that is happening in provincial towns as well.  Why can we not have four generic designs for one, two, three and four-bedroom houses and get on with it instead of having to go back to scratch?  The architects are rubbing their hands about this because they have skin in this game.  One cannot blame them.  It is their job to design.  That is their profession and I am not knocking them for that.  My point is that there is no need to start from scratch each time.<br\/><br\/>I remember when the requirement for houses to be architecturally designed was introduced.  If the officials are ever in County Laois I will show them the houses that the council designed.  They were built from the 1970s up to the 1990s.  My recollection, and I was a county councillor at the time, is that in the period from 2001 to 2003, there was a change to them having to be architecturally designed.  I can show the officials both types of houses.  The ones that are architecturally designed had huge maintenance problems from the start.

For the record, while it has nothing to do with climate change, I would be appalled if we were to restrict ourselves to three or four public housing designs.  In south County Dublin, there was an architect, Thomas Joseph Byrne, who designed several Carnegie libraries and local authority houses using innovative architectural techniques.  He won many architectural awards for his designs.  Architecture needs to take context into account.  There is something Stalinist in having three or four housing designs, particularly in view of the scale of social housing we are going to build.<\/p> <p>  As a former local authority member of long standing, I am of the view that cycle parking facilities have been overlooked for many years.  We tend to locate cycle parking outside residential buildings as opposed to within and, certainly, outside commercial and office buildings.  I do not see why they should not be incorporated within.  It would encourage much more use.  In Dublin city, for example, there is only one car park where one can park a bike for free, namely, that on Drury Street.  As we are encouraging more people to use bicycles, the Department needs to put its stamp on this and mandate local authorities, particularly in urban areas, to start providing this.  I was in Utrecht with a colleague recently.  The biggest bicycle park in the world right is located right in the heart of that city.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about reusing existing building stock and encouraging the use and re-use of buildings in urban and rural areas while influencing transformational change in the pattern of development and settlement by securing more compact growth.  Everything is local.  I know Mr. Paul Hogan from sitting opposite him in the South Dublin County Council chamber.  He was highly esteemed by both his colleagues and elected representatives.  When we were going through the last development plan, I noted they are quite mature areas in my constituency where one has incredibly long back gardens.  In the city, they tended to be used for the development of mews buildings in the past.  Under the development plans, it is allowed for their development but the public is not aware of this.  In my constituency, there are gardens between 120 ft and 200 ft long.  I presume that ties into the compact growth the witnesses were talking about because it uses existing land, facilities, utilities, roads, transport and schools.<\/p><p>I would not like to see the idea of the much maligned granny flat binned because in all probability -  I am just throwing out this figure - one in five houses in my constituency is an empty nest.

Let me clarify that Ms Sarah Neary was talking about internal layouts and specifications.  We are very clear on that.  I do not think local authorities would thank us for imposing a limited number of external designs on local authority housing.  What one sees from the outside of a house has to take into account context and location.  We have seen some very creative designs from the local authorities that others in the private housing development have latched on to.  I would not want anything we do to try to standardise and streamline processes to curtail creativity and good design in any way.<\/p> <p>  As the former planner who we in the Department poached is held in such high esteem, I might ask him to comment on compact growth.  However, I wish to say a few general words.  I do not disagree with the point made by the Deputy on the cycling strategy.  We look forward to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment rolling out a broader cycling strategy.  We would look to that to inform planning policies and approaches in development plans that would then facilitate that as part of an overall national strategy.  We would be very keen on that.  Whether it is the use of long gardens or other ideas, the point Deputy Lahart makes is essentially what we are about when we talk about compact growth.  We are trying to prioritise the use of buildings or areas of land that are underutilised for development, so that the roll-out of the carpet of development does not continue but becomes more concentrated in areas where there already are established services that can be relied on to support them.  I will not dwell on the granny flat proposal but as we recognised two years ago, one of the five pillars of Rebuilding Ireland is how to utilise the existing housing stock.  We are very conscious of the fact - and I do not want to stray into territory the Chairman wants to keep me out of - that this development is important from the compact growth point of view and how we plan better in order that it can have a positive influence in respect of emissions.  We are very conscious that in any country, inevitably there are houses that are underutilised by virtue of life cycle.  We put in place a competition designed to bring forward a proposal or concept that would look at what might be called an empty nest home and how it could be modified for an older person to continue living in the ground floor, and this makes sense in terms of mobility and so on, but perhaps converting the upper floor into a self-contained unit.  We conducted that competition and the project that won through on that is now moving on to the concept testing stage in a house in Clondalkin.  I think there will be a lot of learning arising from that project and - incentives aside - that learning and the promotion of that learning could be hugely important in terms of supporting people who might want to do that.  We have had previous discussions on whether we were forcing people into this but that is not what it is about.

High rise is ultimately a relative concept and sometimes it is better to talk in terms of higher rise because there are probably locations in parts of our main cities where houses are fundamentally two storeys high.  Even going to three or four storeys in those locations would not be considered high rise by many people but it is certainly higher and potentially a better and more efficient use of land, with all of the climate benefits flowing from that.  <\/p> <p>  When we talk about high rise, people automatically assume sometimes that we are talking 20 or 30-storey towers all over the place, that is not the case, it is the concept of higher relative to two storeys and how we can move from what is a very low-rise scenario to something that makes better use of land and provides us with a way of achieving what the national development plan provides for.

The apartment guidelines were recently reviewed, and provide more generous off-street parking standards for bicycles within the buildings, even in cases where car parking is now optional or is not necessary depending on location, in recognition that apartments are more likely to be built in areas where the inhabitants use bicycles.  We are also due to update the national development plan guidelines.  Certainly we would be seeking to incorporate the latest best practice thinking from the NTA, which is quite expert on these matters.  This now goes beyond residential or workplace standards, and looks at city and town centres where people might park their bicycles.<\/p> <p>  The second point was the reuse of building stock and compact growth, the biggest gains probably are to be made in former industrial estates closer to the city, where people can cycle or take public transport or have the Luas near them.  By modest increases in density, as Mr. McCarthy has said, we can achieve quite significant changes.  It is trickier, as we know from our former discussions and deliberations in the suburban areas, where there is an established character and existing residents are quite concerned about change, but an incremental element of change is okay.<\/p><p>I think the issue the Deputy and I discussed previously - at the county development plan stage - was whether it was acceptable to change the proportion of an area based on subdivision.  We were not necessarily talking about granny flats - we were talking about subdivision generally, as is found in other cities.  It think it merits further examination, particularly where there are large gardens and where cars are not a necessity in all cases.  It depends on location.  More work is required on it.  We would be better placed to look at it in our role in the Department.<\/p><p> The issue of sunlight in the context of high-rise developments is a more complex one.  To a certain extent, different forces are at play in such locations.  The designated areas in a city are of interest.  In the main, this is considered from a commercial perspective, as opposed to a residential perspective.  I think there was a degree of uncertainty about building heights because of local development plan standards.  One of the benefits of the imminent publication of the Department's height guidance will be that a degree of certainty or flexibility will be offered depending on what is required.  This guidance will provide for decisions to be made in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>What percentage of social housing stock is over 40 years old?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#O00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Approximately 30% of social housing stock, or some 40,000 units, falls into that category.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I would like to mention two other things.

I have been thinking about phenology, which relates to plant species.  Met &Eacute;ireann is a communication tool.  I think it could serve as a good way of bringing the public on board with regard to climate change.  If this is done on a monthly basis, we will have missed all the storms that are passing so I suggest it should happen on a daily basis.  I was reading on my phone last night that eight people had died during severe flooding in Mallorca.  We have a task that requires urgency.  We have to apply that urgency in how we go forward as a State and as a nation.  As we saw in yesterday's budget, we are losing opportunities.<\/p> <p>  The question of getting the minutes of interdepartmental meetings arose during our last meeting.  Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to a memo.  I ask the officials to think of all documentation that could support us in this process.  We only have until January to come up with a report.  If we could access the minutes of cross-departmental or interdepartmental meetings on climate change, it would be useful in bringing us up to speed.<\/p> <p>  I would like to raise the question of mitigation.  Is provision being made at the moment for houses in low-lying areas that are in flood zones?  Winter is coming, which brings with it the potential for severe weather.  Given that we know sea levels are rising, what is being done to mitigate the current stock of housing, as opposed to new builds, in low-lying areas?<\/p> <p>  Which Department is responsible for peatlands?  At present, the total level of peatland emissions is approximately 9 metric tonnes per year.  What is the potential reduction in peatland emissions?  The national peatlands strategy is almost aspirational regarding the rewetting of degraded peatlands.  When will we have a coherent plan to reduce peatland emissions?  Action needs to be taken to provide for the rewetting of bogs.  No one has spoken about peatlands at today's meeting.  Issues relating to greenhouse gases and methane arise in the context of peatlands.<\/p> <p>  The officials mentioned that 50% of our social housing has been refitted in the first phase of the programme.  What building energy ratings, BERs, have been achieved?  Will all of the stock that was refitted in the first phase be involved in the next phase, which will involve deep retrofitting?  If so, questions have to be asked about the efficiency of the programme.  I wonder why all of this work could not have been completed in the first run.  Are there any policy measures to drive refitting in private rented housing?  Have standards been revised to introduce a minimum building energy rating for rented housing?<\/p> <p>  No climate impact assessment was done with regard to Project Ireland 2040 before it was announced.  The Environmental Protection Agency's projections up to 2035 were announced after the launch of Project Ireland 2040, which meant they could not be included in it.  A special report of the International Panel on Climate Change was published this week.  If any assessments are being carried out or any reports are being prepared on foot of all the information that has become available recently, we should have access to them as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The final matter I would like to raise is the offshore renewable option.  A week ago, I attended a meeting at Waterford Institute of Technology which was attended by the Minister of State, Deputy English, and Mr. Philip Nugent.  They were launching the maritime planning framework baseline report.  I would like the officials from the Department to tell the members of the committee whether we will have to wait for a draft to be published in mid-2019 before a maritime area and foreshore Bill is introduced.  We know from evidence we have heard during recent meetings that this country has significant offshore potential.  This is a huge opportunity for Ireland.  When will we see the legislation to facilitate that?  Are we going to have to wait for the marine planning framework?  Will the legislation be introduced before that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#O01400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who are due to come before the joint committee might be able to give us more information on peatlands.

There is a great deal of modelling work to be done to bring it to fruition in four to five years.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to the Project Ireland delivery board.  I think representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are coming to the committee and have no doubt that the minutes will be publicly available, like any other document.  There is no mystique about this.  We have had four meetings of the delivery board thus far and it is has been about taking the NPF document and working our way through the things we need to roll out to ensure they will progress as envisaged under the framework.  I referred, for example, to the regional spatial and economic strategies which are of critical importance in moving things on and which have been the subject of one of our discussions.  Another matter which may be of direct relevance is that four funds were provided for under Project Ireland, one of which is a climate fund.  We also have our own urban regeneration development fund within the Department.  We are talking about how to move these on to have the available funding deployed to support projects of relevance as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>  Retrofitting residential stock in general has two angles.  We set the performance standards which apply to new dwellings and those which apply when dwellings are being renovated.  The piece on which the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten's Department is leading relates to incentives and measures which may need to be put in place to bring forward retrofitting.  We cannot force people to carry out renovations under the building regulations, but we set the standards which need to be achieved when the renovations are being undertaken.  However, there is a broader economic issue surrounding the economics and supports available to encourage people in the homeownership or private rented sector to bring forward renovation projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I understand there is a phase 1, but I am getting to the deep retrofit where the State gets in with grants and all of the incentives to do a full and thorough job in one run, as opposed to bit by bit, with such an amount being done this year and a requirement to come back next year to do a deeper job.

The point I was making was that the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten's Department was leading on the housing stock issue generally and how retrofits could be encouraged.  However, social housing stocks falls within our remit.  Through the local authorities, we are the custodians of that part of the housing stock and, as such, are involved in and support the retrofitting process in the sector.  Phase 1 retrofitting was designed to use the limited resources available in 2013 when we started doing this work to try to have as much attic and cavity wall insulation work done as we possibly could from a comfort and fuel poverty perspective, as much as from any other.  It was clear that the level of funding available at the time was only sufficient to cover these basic, albeit important, works.  Phase 2 will be a much deeper exercise.  While we are still working to finalise the arrangements for that phase, our ambition is to achieve a B2 BER standard for these social housing units.  As I said, the 30% of our stock which is more than 40 years old is where we will target our initial efforts most as they are the buildings in greatest need of this deep level of retrofit.<\/p> <p>  A strategic environmental assessment of the national planning framework was completed and the report has been published and is publicly available to anyone who wishes to access it.

I will be the fourth Deputy to ask about the refurbishment of the existing housing stock.  The Department has outlined that 30% of housing stock is more than 50 years old and that this will be refurbished to B2 standard.  How much will that cost?  The Department will not give a timeframe or indicate how long it will take.  It says that it depends on the budgetary process.  The Department must know how much it will cost.  Will it tell us how much it will cost and how long it will take to complete?<\/p><p> On offshore wind, and I will be the third Deputy to ask about this, when was legal advice sought?  On the role of local authorities and the Tipperary energy body - I cannot remember its exact name - Mr. McCarthy again said that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would be responsible for whether this would be rolled out to other local authorities.  What role does the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government actually have in terms of local authorities?  Will Mr. McCarthy expand on that because it seems the Department does not have any role?  Will he expand on that issue because it would be very interesting to hear more about it?  Surely the Department, as the governing body for local authorities, could instruct local authorities to roll out this function.  While the local authorities might have to seek funding from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, but surely the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government could exhort them to do this.  The Department provides circulars and sets regulations and planning guidelines, all of which must be consistent with the national planning framework.  It has the role of reviewing local authority development plans.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also under the Department.  Given that it is in charge of development and such matters, the Department must have some role in determining whether the local authorities will deal with this issue.<\/p><p> On Part L regulations and the future-proofing of housing, the Department stated that these changes have been flagged since 2006 or for ten years.  I went on Donegal County Council's website yesterday while preparing for this meeting to look at current planning applications for housing.  Of the nine applications covering 11 houses, which I was only able to briefly look at in the time available, only one would comply with the regulations the Department is talking about.  As far as I can make out, and Mr. McCarthy will advise me if I am wrong, ten of those 11 houses had at least two chimneys.  As I understand it, that would not comply with the regulations the Department is talking about.  They also have solid fuel heating.  If we have been preparing for these regulations for ten years, why is that the case?  These are applications on which Donegal County Council has not yet decided.  Why is that happening?  What is the role of the Department if that is the case?<\/p><p> Mr. McCarthy said that 63% of all capital spending on climate change comes from non-Exchequer funding.  Where will the other 37% come from?  How much will come from Mr. McCarthy's Department?  How will it be spent?<\/p><p> We want to encourage people not to develop in rural locations.  The rural development we have has been used as an excuse for not complying with climate change targets.  The Department, however, is not doing anything to encourage people to move into towns and villages.  Even in the small towns and villages such as are found in my area or in any area of the country, nothing is done to encourage development to take place or to encourage people to develop in the town as an alternative to developing outside of those areas.

Our relationship with local authorities is an issue which is raised with us quite a bit.  If one goes back 20 years, virtually all significant local authority functions were carried out at central government level and were vested in what was then the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  The landscape has changed significantly since then.  Responsibility for roads was transferred to one Department, community development responsibilities were transferred to another and environment was transferred to yet another.  To ensure we are clear in respect of our role, we do not instruct local authorities on what to do in respect of roads or energy.  We do not have that responsibility.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport looks after the roads programme and deals directly with local authorities in that regard.  If I was to do as the Deputy suggests and instruct local authorities to do something in the energy space and tell them to seek money from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, it would not make sense.  It would not achieve anything because I would be instructing local authorities to take an action in the energy space which I am not qualified or competent to ask them to do.  That is why it is for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to roll this out.

Maybe Mr. Hogan will be able to answer on this because it falls within the planning regulations and it is essential when a construction firm or anybody is submitting an application for planning permission.  It is to do with providing more natural environments in our cities, given that cities now hold 50% of our population.  It is projected that 70% of the population will live and-or work in cities within the next 20 years, worldwide and in our own country also.  Is there a comprehensive set of regulations around greenery and public natural spaces?  City planners should be trying to imitate nature as much as possible, not just for people's well-being but also to cleanse the environment of all the pollutants that humans bring.  Has South Dublin County Council heard about that?  I know the local authority in Tipperary has adapted it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of recycling and zero tolerance, plastic and polystyrene are prominent in the headlines and people are much more aware of them.  The public has a sense of guilt about what is being shown on nature programmes and news reports on the toxic seas have had a significant impact on people's behaviour.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are using recyclable disposable cups instead of plastic ones, for example.  On trying to phase out plastic and polystyrene, those materials have been used in the construction of roads and some buildings.  They are quicker to process, recyclable and much more durable and robust that other construction materials.  Is that a legend or is there anything that we might be able to consider doing to use up these seas and mountains of plastic?  As an island nation on the periphery of Europe, we have much more access to the pollutants in the sea which we could try to recoup and put to some positive use.<\/p> <p>  I love Met &Eacute;ireann as I think do most people in the country.  It is about educating the public.  Many of the anachronisms of this place go over people's heads.  Met &Eacute;ireann was to conduct much more research on flooding and how to report it.  Although the young do not watch the State news, a majority of people watch the news followed by the weather.  Could there be a daily or weekly segment in the Met &Eacute;ireann broadcast giving three points of education, including the positive as well as the negative?  We need to use it as an educational tool.  Propaganda is the wrong word but it should be an advertising tool because people listen to it.  Ordinary people would not understand the terms we use in these committees or that are used by the various State agencies.  They shut down and the message goes over their heads.  Something very simple, clear, concise and eye-catching would be effective.  The positive must be reinforced as well as the message about what else needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  Considering yesterday's &euro;121 million increase for landlords under the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and getting back to the points made by Deputy Pringle and Senator Grace O'Sullivan, there is significant investment in rental accommodation.  The private market is taking a significant chunk of what we would have had for social, affordable or cost-rental housing.  The BER rating, I understand, is a private matter for a private household.  The regulations were amended recently for rented units for which RAS or HAP are paid.  The emphasis is now more on the landlord's responsibility.  The provision that rodent infestation was the tenant's responsibility has been removed and landlords are now responsible for fire alarms, laundry facilities and so on.  Could that be further amended to introduce a BER rating?  We do not want to scare off landlords in the current climate but they are getting substantial support from local authorities.  Surely they also need to have responsibility for the energy efficiency of the properties they are offering tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#R02600","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>There are some issues with plastics with which the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment may want to deal, but perhaps it is in the marine space that this Department could deal with them.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy asked a question about Met &Eacute;ireann.

If we are expecting more people to live within existing towns and cities, we must improve their liveability and quality of life.  The old-fashioned planning word is \"amenity\".  It is a word that comes up a lot, whether in planning applications or reference to the amenities of a place.  However it is described, it is just about things like providing quality public spaces and routes for people to take exercise and clear their heads.  There are great examples in the docklands in Dublin, along the river and the quays and also in some of the greenways, particularly the ones in rural areas, but there are ones on the way in urban areas that are taking a little longer to provide.  These are important in the context of what we are talking about.  There are four funds being assessed on foot of Project Ireland 2040, two of which relate to urban and rural development.  To go back to the point raised by Deputy Thomas Pringle about encouraging people to move into towns and villages by choice, the point of the funds is to make a difference, to make it more attractive to develop and invest in urban places, whether cities, towns or villages.  Over a period of ten years &euro;2 billion has been committed for urban regeneration and &euro;1 billion for rural regeneration.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is considering the urban fund, while the Department of Rural and Community Development is considering the rural fund.  The Department had received 170 or 180 bids before last week's closing date, while the Department of Rural and Community Development had received 300.  The things for which the Departments would be looking are exactly what the Senator described such as, for example, investment in public spaces to make places more attractive but also to generate real development and provide for things like water services to improve the capacity of small places.  That is very much on the agenda.  The Department recognises that people will not change their behaviour by choice and that there must be a degree of prioritisation from an investment perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Will it be an essential criterion when a planning application is received?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#S00600","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>It can be difficult at the level of the individual planning application where one particular site or scheme has to fit in.

Crossmolina is under threat of flooding and facing into another weather warning.  It underlines the importance of adaptation works, the work the OPW is undertaking under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme and the work it undertook before it.  Crossmolina was listed in advance of the CFRAM programme and that body of work, but, unfortunately, it has still been flooded twice in the recent past.  Some people have no insurance cover.<\/p> <p>  Many of the flooded areas in County Mayo are not areas where new development has taken place.  They are in the old parts of towns built on rivers, as Mr. McCarthy said.  The surges from rivers are different, as are the weather conditions.  The communications from people lliving in them are stark.  I hope people have not been flooded, but we are fearful of what will happen over the weekend.<\/p> <p>  Some minor work schemes have been approved by the OPW in Crossmolina, as in other areas, until the major flood defences are built.  I hope they will provide protection up to a certain height. <\/p> <p>  I have a few points to make and questions to ask.  We are facing the prospect of not achieving our 2020 targets.  It is fair to say that in 2009 when we signed up to our renewable energy directive commitments, nobody thought we were being overly ambitious in the areas of electricity generation and renewable energy.  Ireland has the best onshore and offshore wind energy resources.  We have an abundance of renewable resources, including wave energy.  For us to move forward there is a need for an expos&eacute;, perhaps by somebody like Mr. McCarthy.  He has been less involved on the climate action side of things in the past two years, but up until this point, it has fallen within the remit of his Department.  Why have we not achieved the targets set?  We have better resources than other European countries, but we have not achieved the targets set.<\/p><p>Will the witnesses comment on our planning process, delays in planning and lack of guidance?  How can it take so long for a review of the 2006 wind farm guidelines?  What are we learning from this?<\/p><p> Planning for electricity has been a problem.  I agree with Deputy Pringle about the issue of agreeing a marine spatial plan and looking at our marine resource in a sustainable way and as part of the solution for our renewable energy needs.  People like Mr. McCarthy, under whose stewardship this was happening, need to answer the question.  Many people point fingers at Government, saying it is not hitting targets.  Not much drilling down is being done into different moving parts and community acceptance.  The witnesses did not have the review of wind energy guidelines.  It was promised to many people and many people have objected.  I would also like to know how many energy projects have been refused.<\/p><p> I would like to tie into that, when Mr. McCarthy is addressing the planning system, the Apple project in Athenry, which included a proposed wind farm.  I understand there are questions on environmental concerns which were to be referred to the European Court of Justice.  I do not know if they are technicalities.  I have asked for more information on it.<\/p><p> Every time we try to develop in this country, there seem to be problems with environmental designation.  I have talked about this in different contexts relating to the building of infrastructure, special areas of conservation, SACs, habitats, birds and so on.  Derrybrien wind farm was built on a bog.  I presume it was an SAC.  It is said that proper environmental studies were not done but when one is building a wind farm in a remote area where it is not interfering with people, it would seem it cannot be built on an SAC.  Will the witnesses give some analysis of where it has all gone wrong when, on the face of it, we should be head of the class, especially with renewable electricity?<\/p><p> I welcome the energy retrofits that have taken place in local authority housing stock.  Mr. McCarthy referred to more than 64,000 houses in his presentation.  How much has that cost?  What building energy rating, BER, has that brought those houses to?  What BER had they previously?  Mr. McCarthy mentioned 20,000 or 30,000.  Is that for deep retrofitting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#S01700","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Ms Neary mentioned works done in different local authority areas.

They changed the heating system to an upgraded oil boiler.  There are many people who are now locked into a fossil fuel, oil.  I could never understand why more was not being done.  People complain that we are not levying more carbon taxes but, at the end of the day, these people have no choice about switching their heating system.  They are very much dependent on State policies, whether of the local authority or what central government is doing for them.  I suggest that is a missed opportunity and, going forward, those heating systems will not be pulled out again.<\/p> <p>  The point made to me the most by many people who had this work done was that, while they were glad to get new windows and such, there could be older people who had ranges, fires or even back boilers taken out of their houses.  They were no longer allowed solid fuel because it was wrong and it was a fossil fuel, but they were allowed to have oil.  At the same time, from their point of view, they had more control over burning solid fuel on an open fire with a back boiler than they had with oil.  There are now people living in a form of fuel poverty because they are watching whether the price of oil is going down and if they will have enough.  I fully appreciate that where people are on basic incomes, they are getting a fuel allowance, but it is not conducive to comfort people who are older or sick and who need much more heating.  It does not make any sense.  The Department has presided over that and it is wrong.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the witnesses' presentation.  We would like to think that, as we move forward with energy efficiency and renewable energy, there comes a point at which it becomes more economically viable.  If we invest in renewables, over the longer term, we will pay less, whether as a business, a home or the State.  There is an initial cost, whether it is changing the heating system, upgrading, etc.  I want to look at the issue of cost.<\/p> <p>  At a previous meeting of this committee, I asked the question, maybe of the Department of the Minister, Deputy Naughten, if there was a committee or group of people who were looking at the cost of building houses to nearly zero energy building, NZEB, standard, and the answer was that it would be better if the witnesses gave us costings.  I see the witnesses gave us a costing of 0.7% to 4.2% of an additional cost on a social house.  I presume that would also apply to the private sector generally across the board.  That will be an additional cost for all the houses we need to build in the country to address our housing situation, not that many houses were built in the past ten years.  I know there have been complaints, even prior to the operation of the NZEB standard, about new building regulations.  These have not just been about energy performance but also about structural soundness, making sure there are no problems with blockwork, and the fact the procedures required have created additional costs.  I wonder about the effect of that, apart from the cost of building materials, when it comes to the cost of houses.  Besides NZEB requirements, what have changes in building regulations and standards in the past ten years added to the cost of building a basic house?  Do the witnesses have that information?<\/p> <p>  What is the witnesses' term for the major upgrading of a house?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#T00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Deep retrofit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Major renovations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#T00500","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539176400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Major renovations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101000002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539176400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>A situation in the country has been identified.

Ireland's emissions profile stands out very much apart from many other EU countries because of the extent of the emissions from agriculture.  I am sure representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will come before the committee at some stage.  It is a big challenge for Ireland and, from memory, it seems only Denmark has a non-emissions trading profile that would see agriculture accounting for anything near the share of emissions that it accounts for here.

There are certainly parts of the country where vacancy continues to be a significant matter.  We have tried to do a number of things.  We have tried to introduce schemes, including those mentioned by the member, to try to bring some of those vacant properties back into use.  For example, with the repair and lease scheme we allow up to &euro;40,000 in capital funding to repair a property and it would be leased for a minimum of five years.  With the buy and renew scheme we are more flexible.  In reality, with a buy and renew property, comparatively less money would be spent because the property would be in such bad nick, with the bulk of the money having to go into a renovation.<\/p> <p>  A number of local authorities have people on the ground doing surveys in areas where the census suggests there should be vacancy hotspots.  Fingal is one and Waterford is another, and the information coming back is that the level of vacancy in the areas that have been examined is massively less than what the census suggested.  We should bear in mind that when the census counted vacancies, it included properties for sale and rent that were just turning over in the normal market.  We have established a vacancy office in the local government system, which is run from Mayo and is trying to promote among property owners the fact that we have funding available to try to bring vacant properties back into use.  We are providing a web facility where vacant properties can be notified to the local authority so they can be investigated to see if they can be added to the housing stock.

I am joined here today by my RT&Eacute; colleague, Mr. Rory Coveney, and Mr. Mathew Horsman from Mediatique, which completed the review, entitled &quot;RT&Eacute; Orchestras: Ensuring a Sustainable Future&quot;, with Ms Helen Boaden.<br\/><br\/>The petition to Minister for Culture, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, came on foot an announcement by RT&Eacute; that it would conduct an independent review of its orchestral provision.  The fact the petition garnered such support, and that is has been presented for the formal consideration of the Oireachtas, is testimony to the importance of this issue.  RT&Eacute; concurs with that position, and we welcome the opportunity to discuss the findings of that review with the members here today.  As members will be aware, this review was conducted against challenging financial circumstances facing the organisation, and these circumstances persist.<br\/><br\/>Members may have seen that just last week the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s regulator, having completed a statutory five-year review of both RT&Eacute; and TG4, recommended:<\/p><blockquote>at a minimum, that RT&Eacute; should receive an increase in its annual public funding of &euro;30m per annum.  Given the urgency of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s current funding position, the increased level of public funding recommended should be available to the broadcaster immediately.<\/blockquote> <p>In presenting its recommendations, the BAI has taken account of the fact that, notwithstanding its frequent funding recommendations to Government in the case of RT&Eacute;, there has been no television licence fee increase in more than ten years.  RT&Eacute;'s total income decreased by approximately  &euro;100 million per annum, or 24%, between 2008 and 2016.  Commercial growth has been modest since 2016 and the television licence fee system remains unreformed.<br\/><br\/>As Mathew from Mediatique will explain shortly, orchestral music in other countries is typically supported by a variety of public funding mechanisms and grants at national, regional and local government level.  In Ireland, by contrast, full-time orchestral music is dependent on just one public funding source: the TV licence fee.  While RT&Eacute; orchestras have been relatively protected, their budget has declined by 11% in that period, much more than other areas of RT&Eacute;'s output.  We now have significant vacancies in our orchestras and have had to sharply reduce commitments to touring and educational activity.  Morale within the orchestras has suffered, as has the overall public value of our orchestral provision.<br\/><br\/>As the review was triggered we were looking at more cuts to budgets and were finding it difficult to see how we could accommodate even the current level of provision.  There was no possibility of the increase in budgets that would be required for the orchestras to return to full strength and undertake touring and education programmes.  Put simply, RT&Eacute; commissioned the Boaden review because it was clear to us that, as far as the RT&Eacute; orchestras were concerned, the <i>status quo<\/i>could not continue.  Although there might have been some erroneous assumptions made that this review was intended to reduce orchestral provision, there was a wholly correct observation in the following statement: <\/p><blockquote>The implications of these cuts are shocking, especially given that Arts and Music Education in Ireland is already severely underfunded, and one of the worst systems in the whole of Europe.  Something needs to be done to preserve and develop these orchestral institutions.<\/blockquote> <p>It was within the spirit of exploring viable solutions to address this situation that RT&Eacute; commissioned the review.<br\/><br\/>RT&Eacute; is aware of the importance of our orchestras within the wider cultural life of the nation and the role we have played in this for the past 70 years.  The issues raised, as evidenced in the online petition and the Mediatique-Boaden review, affect not just RT&Eacute; but Ireland as a whole.  The review carried out in-depth analysis of the options facing us, ranging from outright closure to a merger to retention with full funding restored.  Critically, the review concluded that neither of the two orchestras should be closed.  In fact, they suggested both orchestras should be brought back to full strength.  It became clear to the review authors, as they consulted widely, that there is widespread support for the retention of both orchestras, across the orchestra sector, among all political parties and within Government but, owing to the review, there is also now a wider understanding and recognition of the challenges facing RT&Eacute; with much more constrained financial resources.<br\/><br\/>The review outcome and key recommendations are consistent with the analysis of previous reviews such as the PIANO report.  It recommended that the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, be either established as a cultural institution in its own right or move to become part of the National Concert Hall.  A key provision of the review is that it promotes RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s role as a key orchestral media partner, through ongoing stewardship of National Concert Orchestra and close affiliation with the NSO in the future.  It recognises the balance between RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s financial constraints and its public service role in promoting music, arts and culture.<\/p><p>Flexibility will be required from orchestra members, but the recommended approach provides a sustainable means of restoring the orchestras to former strength and the basis for a new creative vision.  RT&Eacute; was acutely conscious that any decisions that followed the review were not to be for it alone to make.  The overall funding and governance arrangements for orchestral provision in Ireland are as much a matter of public policy as they are considerations for RT&Eacute;.  The support of Government, therefore, will be essential if orchestral music in Ireland is to flourish and if the recommendations of the review are to be implemented.<\/p><p> In July, the Cabinet considered the review and its recommendations.  We included the statement issued by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, in the materials we sent to the committee.  It will be seen that the Government has decided that the National Symphony Orchestra is to come within the remit of the National Concert Hall.  In addition, the Government authorised the initiation of discussions on the implementation of the recommendations of the review.  Those discussions are to be led by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, through both an oversight group and working group and the relevant stakeholders, RT&Eacute; and the National Concert Hall, and with appropriate wider consultation.<\/p><p> There has been initial contact between the various stakeholders and the terms of reference for the groups is now being finalised.  We hope to begin the formal discussions shortly.  That is where things stand today.  We thought it would be useful for the committee in considering the petition, and the related issues it has raised, to hear from the authors of the Boaden\/Mediatique review about their findings and their analysis.  Ms Helen Boaden, unfortunately, could not be here but Mr. Mathew Horsman of Mediatique is here to give a brief overview of the outcomes of the review.  We will take questions after that, if the committee wishes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018101000002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; Dubhghaill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539174600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I propose we hear the submission from Mathew.

We spent several months talking across the market, to many different people in orchestral music and classical music and most, if not all, of the stakeholders with some skin in this particular game concerning the future of orchestral music in Ireland.  As we started the process and went through it, we were aware that the review was coming at a time of financial challenge for public service broadcasting.  RT&Eacute;, throughout this period, and for some time before, had been facing funding pressures with the licence fee as well as commercial revenue weakness.  That was exacerbated by the structural challenges faced by media companies.  I refer to the new entrant challengers such as Amazon, Facebook, Apple, all of the things that people talk about.<\/p> <p>  When we set out to do this work, we also understood two other important contextual issues.  One was that there were no countries or markets in the world where orchestral music is not publicly funded.  There is no commercial funding model for orchestral music - there is always a public funding element.  We were also aware, however, as we went through the international benchmarking, that Ireland was very different from many markets.  It had only one form of public funding, that is the licence fee, and the only full time orchestras in Ireland were both operated by RT&Eacute;.  That was the background for the report.  <\/p> <p>  The question we were asked to answer was not whether one should shut orchestras or merge them.  The question was about whether we sustain the provision of orchestral music in Ireland and that was what we set out to answer.  We did international benchmarking but I will not go through the detail because it is in the pack.  We looked at a number of sources of evidence, including stakeholder interviews and data from surveys asking people what they thought.  There was widespread support for orchestral music, even among those who do not necessarily consume it.  People also believed there should be an element of public funding, so there was a good measure of support in the survey.  We also did much financial modelling and checking across the market for market sizing and context for all this.  While we were completing the recommendations, which I will finish on, it was very clear to us that the challenge for RT&Eacute; was huge.<\/p> <p>  Between 2008 and 2016, the last year for which we had data at the time of the report, income decreased by 24%.  The orchestras were actually quite protected in that period, being down by 11% and so less than the overall hit RT&Eacute; took.  From looking at the situation, however, it was difficult to see how RT&Eacute; could continue to fund the current level of provision, given the demands on the licence fee and commercial revenue, let alone increase the orchestras' traditional touring and educational activities back to historic levels.  We did think those traditional touring and educational activities were very important in respect of the overall situation of orchestral music in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  We concluded the orchestras were so important that they were more important than RT&Eacute;.  Even though our job was to answer a question put to us by RT&Eacute;, our answer became more complicated because RT&Eacute; did not have, within itself, the full answer.  We felt that answer should, therefore, be a statement that both orchestras should be safeguarded, they should be brought back up to their traditional strength and they should again tour and do educational programmes but that only the concert orchestra should remain within the control and direct operation of RT&Eacute; as a traditional public service orchestra.  The National Symphony Orchestra, living up to its name, would be a true national symphony orchestra either as a cultural institution in its own right or through the evolving status of the National Concert Hall.  It was a natural partner through its operations and facilities.  <\/p> <p>  We did not come down on one side or the other.  That was something for the players and stakeholders to decide.  We felt that something that would give the NSO independence from RT&Eacute; would safeguard its future.  We also thought that would give both orchestras the chance to have a renewed creative vision and to work together.  I will underline, as my last comment here, that we had some suggested funding outcomes, but that is, again, for the stakeholders to decide.  We suggested there needs to be an ongoing contribution from RT&Eacute;, even to the NSO, in the form of what we called the broadcasting fee.  That was because it was important that the RT&Eacute; continues to support the orchestra.  There would, however, be a shortfall if we were to get the kind of outcome we wanted, and that we think is desirable in Ireland, of returning to historical levels.  The Government would be asked to step in to meet that shortfall.  Our recommendation was that would occur and I was pleased to see, around the time the report was published, that the Government agreed that these were interesting recommendations and worth taking on board. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018101000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mathew Horsman"},{"type":"speech","time":1539174600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Cassells.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018101000002#C00600","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1539174600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I welcome the three witnesses.  I thank them for the presentations and the discussion we are having on the National Symphony Orchestra and the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra.  I greatly value both.  It is, perhaps, often forgotten that the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra has a presence beyond Donnybrook and the National Concert Hall.  I was delighted last year to welcome the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra to my own home town of Navan.  As part of its programme, the orchestra played a gala concert to mark the tenth anniversary of Solstice, our own arts centre in Navan.  A native son of Navan, Mr. Brian Byrne, was conducting that night.  It was greatly valued by our patrons and indeed by the people of our county.<\/p> <p>  Days and weeks of practice, however, were required for people to enjoy those two hours of entertainment and pleasure on that Friday night.  There is the rub in respect of funding in this budget week and the discussions we are having to sustain a valued cultural contribution to our country.  I am familiar with the issues Mr. &Oacute; Dubhghaill has raised about income.  I looked at the report and the &euro;100 million drop in total revenue over the past ten years is something I, and the Committee of Public Accounts, have pressed when we have discussed this.  I refer to the need for an honest appraisal by all bodies and for them to state they will stop dodging the bullet and actually deal with the funding issue for our national broadcaster and all of the other activities that entails.  If we do not do that, as a result of the conversations here today, there is an overhanging threat, implicit in the background, to the future of our concert orchestra.<\/p> <p>  The challenges other platforms are posing to commercial income, as Mr. Horsman has said, because of where commercial partners are now going as opposed to the traditional areas, has to be taken into consideration when funding is being decided for RT&Eacute; and all that it provides.  On the review itself, as Mr. &Oacute; Dubhghaill said, I welcome how it has brought a spotlight onto these issues.  It has, perhaps, also shown that there is greater public awareness than people anticipated.  The statistics produced are interesting in respect of those 35% who have attended an RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra performance, and some people attended more than once.<\/p><p>That is a very encouraging statistic.  The listenership for orchestras on Lyric FM is at 16% every month.  There are strong percentages there for what is a very niche market.  It shows a greater public awareness than perhaps many people thought.  It is interesting to have that debate and it shows the value of having the review because it underscores the commitment to keeping funding.<\/p><p> Assuming we can get past this impasse and services are retained, how can we make sure we do not come back to this again?  How do we ensure that it grows and that there is not this threat of a part-time orchestra and so forth?  Mr. &Oacute; Dubhghaill talked about the flexibility that would be required from orchestra members.  He might elaborate on that somewhat.  He spoke about synergy and the work of the National Symphony Orchestra coming within the remit of the National Concert Hall.  How has all that panned out and how is it coming together?  What are some of the challenges the witnesses are facing?  I welcome them, thank them for the work that has been done and assure them that I will be advocating for the funding that is necessary to make sure we protect and grow a valued part of our culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018101000002#C00700","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539174600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>The future provision of orchestral music in Ireland is so much in everybody's hands here at the moment.

The review has attempted to create a road map for a sustainable future.  What happens next is important.  As Mr. &Oacute; Dubhghaill said, these are not decisions just for us to make.  We have been heartened by the reaction of Government.  It was swift in supporting all the findings of the review, which has implications in terms of finance and governance for people other than just us.<\/p> <p>  The Cabinet considered the review in total and the recommendations therein in July and made an important decision around the ultimate home of the NSO.  There are two options in the review, as Mr. Horsman stated, and the Government came down on the side of joining the National Concert Hall and the National Symphony Orchestra in one cultural institution into the future.  That has challenges, of course, but there is logic to it.  It is the current physical home of the NSO.  There is no doubt that there are significant challenges for the hall to absorb the very big new responsibility of running the National Symphony Orchestra, not least the number of people in it.  It is growing its head count very significantly - in fact, it is tripling.<\/p> <p>  There are associated governance arrangements in respect of the legislation that underpins the National Concert Hall.  Some of that may need to be adjusted and the board structure of the hall itself may need to reflect the new responsibilities.  Ultimately, as the review recommended, there is a new funding mechanism which would require a grant of some kind to be delivered, most likely through the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, a continued funding relationship between RT&Eacute; and the NSO and, obviously, commercial income generated from the performances as well.  All of that is to be worked out over the next year or so, along with the physical transition in terms of employment rights and everything else.  That process between RT&Eacute; and the National Concert Hall is to be managed by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which has been mandated by Cabinet to do so.  It is chairing the respective working groups to get this done in a way that works for everyone.  So far, so good.  <\/p> <p>  I should also say that this has been very difficult for the musicians from the outset.  They have had their future dangled in front of them and uncertainty about their future has been around for some time in RT&Eacute;.  The review understandably made everyone somewhat nervous.  There is a plan and there now appears to be support for it.  We are hopeful that all the stakeholders can deliver it as soon as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018101000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Coveney"},{"type":"speech","time":1539174600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

Every 80 cent per euro spent comes from RT&Eacute;.  There is a critical breakdown of this on page 4 of the pack we have provided.  We point out that there is also a little bit of Arts Council funding for some of the other groups, some non-RT&Eacute; commercial income, adding up to just 5% of the total market, and some other small public grants.  When so much rests with a single provider a very unbalanced market is produced.  That was the main observation in the market sizing analysis we started with in this process.<\/p> <p>  Many stakeholders we spoke to outside RT&Eacute; have been around long enough to remember the PIANO report from some years ago which recommended that the National Symphony Orchestra be set up as an independent orchestra outside RT&Eacute;.  We were mindful of previous reports while carrying out our work, but we very much responded to the current set of dynamics.  We did not seek to parrot the contents of older reports.  From our perspective, it was interesting to hear repeatedly from stakeholders that we need two orchestras because they are the magnets of the sector.  To safeguard it they believed the National Symphony Orchestra should truly be a National Symphony Orchestra, independent and set up as a separate entity.  That view was expressed widely among those we spoke to.  There were different points of view and differences of opinion, but most people subscribed to that idea.

In terms of funding, is it the case that we are already paying for the orchestras through the licence fee?  Mr. &Oacute; Dubhghaill referred to seeking extra money from the licence fee, and the director general of RT&Eacute; has said the same.  Is the case that we fall back to the same old solution of increasing the licence fee?  Pat Rabbitte, when he was Minister, propose a model to change that.  It costs &euro;4 million to maintain the orchestra and RT&Eacute; has a statutory obligation to do so.  Is that correct?  The Government provides X amount of money and RT&Eacute; provides Y.

Is there scope to receive monies from the Creative Ireland funding announced earlier this year?  We are all conscious of the need for reform, but if the orchestras are placed under the jurisdiction of the National Concert Hall, as the Boaden review suggests, how can growth of the orchestras be prioritised given that there has been an attrition of musicians?  We have to provide certainty for them.

The witnesses are most welcome.  Going back to the petition that came in, it was very important because it has opened up a new debate on the orchestras.  I was just thinking of all the fantastic performances involving the orchestras, whether on \"The Late Late Show\" or with Daniel O'Donnell, Mike Denver or some of the pop stars.  Amazing shows have been put on.  I cannot think of the name of the guy from Mullingar with whom the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra did one recently.  It was fantastic.  Right throughout the country there is huge - I will not say \"recognition\" as I think there is an issue with recognition - but acknowledgement of the good thing this is.  I hope from what is happening here we will have further recognition of the orchestras.  I am just looking at a piece of material about the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra here, which states \"Enhancing life through music's extraordinary capacity to communicate, motivate, uplift, educate and entertain is at the heart of the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra.\"  From my 20 years of involvement in media - producing, presenting and doing a lot of music at times - I can really appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  I have just one or two very brief questions.  First, how many full-time musicians do the orchestras have?  I do not know whether that has been clarified yet.  Second, obviously, financial constraints perhaps in recent years have been an issue.  If the orchestras had a substantial sponsor - I do not know whether they can get one; I am just asking - could they get out into the country more?  I think this type of music would be a hit in every county.  Obviously, the orchestras cannot be on the road every week of the year but I think this would be a significant area of creating more finance and getting better known.  Everyone will talk about the orchestra when they see it on \"The Late Late Show\", \"The Ray D'Arcy Show\" or some other show or in concert with someone but I think it goes out of people's minds then.  What the orchestras do is fantastic, and they are staffed by absolutely amazing people, so it could be very positive if they had the right financial backing.<\/p> <p>  They are the two things I would like clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018101000002#F00600","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539174600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Both the models to which the Deputy referred, between sponsorship and actually getting people to back us in whatever way possible, are undoubtedly looked at constantly.

They are not sponsoring the arts specifically, but they are certainly not sponsoring orchestral output.  It is getting more and more difficult to get anyone who is interested in such sponsorship.  This is a global issue, however, not just here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the size of the orchestras.  The National Symphony Orchestra had 81 players; it now has 68 players.  The RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra had 45 players; it now has 40 players.

The issue of sponsorship and commercial support is related to a clear future as well.  An orchestra which is fully staffed, touring routinely and attempting more and more ambitious programming starts to become much more attractive to our sponsors as well.  There is something of a virtuous circle here.  If one gets a baseline level of funding that enables one to do very exciting things with two orchestras, other commercial opportunities open up.  We have seen some of this in the concert orchestra in recent years.  I am not sure if any of the members have been to the Jenny Greene gigs around the country, but they have been at the Live at the Marquee event in Cork four times now and are due back again.  It is a 1990s dance retrospective with an orchestra, which is getting an enormous reaction.  It is very different.

It is very expensive to run an orchestra and to take it on the road.  Looking at the period we looked at, 2007 to 2016, the number of regional performances outside of Dublin by the NSO was 11 in 2007 and just three in 2016.  There were 20 educational performances in 2007 and just 13 in 2016.  This was because of the constant need to find cuts.  The easiest thing to do is to stop travelling and to stay in one place.  It was not the best outcome culturally or artistically but it was a necessity financially.<br\/><br\/>I will make a final point.  We felt - Helen Boaden and Mediatique felt - very strongly that it was incumbent upon us to consider how to get to the point of funding certainty and to be realistic in what we said.  We therefore thought realistically about the commercial revenues that were possible.  In our modelling, worked on by my colleague George Smith behind me, we worked through what the commercial revenues might be, and in our assumptions they are higher than they have been, so we assume that with better functioning of and more excitement about the two fully staffed orchestras, they could make more money.  There is a limit to this, however.  This is how we focused on the amount of the gap.  I refer to the XYZ calculation: X from broadcast fees from RT&Eacute;, Y from the commercial world and Z from the gap, which would be a direct grant of some kind.

I just wanted to give the witnesses an opportunity to respond to that point, which was put on the record in another committee in these Houses.  If RT&Eacute; had its choice, and if approximately &euro;4 million was the figure that a State Department or the Arts Council was to put in to make up the shortfall, would RT&Eacute; prefer to just get that &euro;4 million rather than seeing a new entity created?  If that had been the case, could it guarantee that the &euro;4 million would be spent on the orchestras as opposed to getting consumed?

I understand the committee, as part of its deliberations, wishes to discuss, in particular, two planning issues relevant to the topic, namely, the appropriate planning considerations related to the location of proposed fast-food outlets in the vicinity of school premises and the availability of public spaces for children's activities.<\/p> <p>  By way of introduction, it is important to state the overall thrust of national planning policy is to promote the development of good places in which to live, work and play.  A key part of the place-making agenda is ensuring, through the planning processes, we take all necessary steps to encourage, facilitate and integrate physical activity for citizens of all ages and physical abilities and levels of mobility in the design of existing and future communities.  In practical terms, one of the best ways to achievie this is by prioritising forms of development that benefit from good accessibility in terms of walking and cycling facilities and striving continually for the improvement of such facilities in both existing and newly developing areas.  This is in the overall context of an increase in the national population of approximately 1 million by 2040, with the number of people aged 15 years or under predicted to continue to increase until the early 2020s and decline only slowly thereafter. <\/p> <p>  While national and strategic planning policy is set out in the national planning framework, regional economic and development strategies and local authority development plans, the key operational planning document that deals with the issues under consideration by the committee is the statutory guidelines for planning authorities for local area plans issued by the Minister in 2013.  Section 5 of the guidelines offers advice on the structure and content of local area plans and sets out a range of policies that can be put in place to promote and facilitate active and healthy living patterns in local communities.  They include policies on promoting walking and cycling as modes of transport; access to public open spaces and recreational and sports facilities; the proximity of new developments to sustainable travel modes; the provision of play areas; and the careful consideration of the appropriateness of the location of fast-food outlets in the vicinity of schools and parks. <\/p> <p>  A practical effect of the guidelines with regard to fast-food outlets is that consideration can be given to the appropriateness of their location in the vicinity of schools and parks, for example, in newly developing areas, while at the same time taking into account wider land-use considerations such as the clustering of uses in close proximity to each other to allow for access by foot or bicycle.  With regard to the many schools located in or near existing developed town centres, however, the practical implications of restricting fast-food outlets in these circumstances need to be carefully considered in view of the mix of existing uses typically found in urban areas.  Moreover, in focusing on limiting the exposure of schoolgoing children to the availability of fast food, there could be unintended consequences regarding the location of future schools in that they may be located in less central locations, with knock-on implications for promoting non-car accessibility. <\/p> <p>  In addition, planning policy on the location of fast-food outlets needs to be considered within the wider policy context of practical steps that can be taken to promote more widely and facilitate active and healthy living patterns by enhancing the scope for activities such as walking, cycling and sports and active leisure pursuits and their associated facilities.  For example, ensuring effective pedestrian and cycle networks can develop between residential areas and between those areas and schools and locations where shops and local services are provided should be a priority.  In reality, the development or even the retention of such links which are so essential in maximising physical activity can be highly contentious locally, to which many committee members may attest. <\/p> <p>  On the availability of public spaces for children's activities, our general planning policy approach has been and will continue to be one that actively promotes their provision.  Over a long period planning policy has sought to support the delivery of a range of public spaces commensurate with the scale of development, from informal open spaces to regional parks that allow for a range of activities.  Furthermore, in the light of an increase in the population, this means that the continued provision and enhancement of facilities and amenities for children and young people such as playgrounds, parks and sports grounds remains necessary.  They will need to be maintained at similar levels for the foreseeable future.  It also means that, with a significant proportion of future population growth to occur within or close to the current built-up footprint of settlements, it will be possible to maximise the use of existing facilities near where children and young people live through the provision of enhanced facilities. <\/p> <p>  A key planning issue is the integration of healthy living into the built environment.  This allows for the informal incorporation of fitness into everyday life.  To assist in achieving this objective, the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets, DMURS, has been produced.  It provides practical guidance to assist in the design and development of active and safe neighbourhoods for walking and cycling.<\/p><p>In this regard, it is important to emphasise the need to integrate good, appropriate linkage for walking and cycling to public spaces, particularly those at the level that serve a town or large urban settlement, where more formal physical activities such as field sports are undertaken.  This allows for children or young adults, as appropriate, to access these facilities without necessarily relying on the car.<\/p><p> From a planning perspective, a key consideration in promoting active and healthy lifestyles and physical activity and combating one of the causes of obesity is improving accessibility within our urban settlements for non-car-based modes of transport.  At the same time, however, we have to recognise there are a range of uses which are appropriate for urban settlements in order for them to serve all members of the community.  I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018101000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539160200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation extended to the City and County Management Association to address it in regard to the urgent issue of childhood obesity.  I understand from our inquiries the committee is particularly interested in looking at ways in which the planning and development control system can assist, particularly in regard to the siting of takeaway and fast food outlets near schools and other places frequented by children.  Having considered the wider roles of local government and where our plans and policies can assist in tackling issues around childhood obesity, I have decided to look at the topic not just from a control and regulation point of view, but also in the context of other areas such as the local economic and community plans and the Healthy Ireland plan, which is now produced by each council.<\/p> <p>  The making of county development plans is a key strategic function of local authorities, and is a reserved function of the elected members of a county or city council.  The plans not only set the context and policies which govern planning applications but, at a more fundamental level, a development plan is described as &ldquo;a spatial framework, which, while acknowledging wider social, economic and environmental trends, needs to focus on the 'big picture' planning issues, possibilities and considerations that will underpin how the development process in that area is to be structured in order to achieve the plan&rsquo;s objectives for the wider community.&rdquo;  I suppose we are also talking about the current trendy phrase, \"placemaking\", and Mr. Ryan referred to making great places to live and work.  Essentially, however, all this means that while a new development plan must conform to a whole series of legal requirements, as set out in planning and development and other legislation, as well as the guidelines to which Mr. Ryan referred, the plan is also about a vision for the particular city or county and about making that a great place to live, work and play.  This allows councils to add their own flavour and priorities to their development plan.  In the case of my own county, Louth was the first age friendly county in Ireland and our policies around the age friendly agenda are embedded in our development plan.<\/p> <p>  With regard to childhood obesity and the city or county development plan, I understand the committee is interested in planning law, the siting of fast food outlets and so on.  Certainly, there has been a growing and vocal lobby advocating for the inclusion of bans on fast food outlets near schools via city and county development plans.  That is at different stages in different counties and some of the plans, to which I will refer later, are quite recent, whereas, in my county, we are not due to begin reviewing our plan until the end of next year and all current plans are sitting waiting.<\/p> <p>  A number of county chief executives have expressed concern about such an approach, citing, in particular, concerns about the situation in a smaller village where the presence of a school might result in a total ban on such outlets in that village.  However, a number of councils have already adopted development plans which contain restrictions.  For example, South Dublin County Council has included an objective &ldquo;to restrict the opening of new fast food-takeaway outlets in close proximity to schools so as to protect the health and well-being of school-going children\", although this particular example does not set a specific distance.  Dublin City Council has a policy to &ldquo;safeguard the health of young people that no further fast food outlets should be permitted within 250 m of primary and secondary schools (not to apply to delicatessen and convenience stores), unless an evidence-based case is made by the applicant that the proposed development would be in the interests of the proper planning and development of the area.&rdquo;  Wexford has a more clear-cut statement that the development of hot food takeaways will be strictly controlled and a proliferation of this use will not be encouraged.  It goes on to say that proposals for this type of development will not be permitted where it is within 200 m radius of educational establishments, which gives it a wider application.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, these examples show it is possible, within the provisions of existing legislation and guidelines, to include policies and objectives of the type being considered by the committee.  At present, those policies included by councils are generally around fast food near schools but perhaps new guidelines or recommendations could be developed to offer advice about a range of policies that might be considered.  As I mentioned, local government is in a pause period while we engage in the translation of the national planning framework, Project Ireland 2040, to the new regional plans.  Following its adoption, all city and county councils will work on their development plans either to bring in variations or to bring in entirely new plans, which will have to reflect both Project Ireland 2040 and the regional, social and economic plans for their areas.  Now is a very good time to consider new guidelines or to consider how issues around childhood obesity might be considered in the next round of development plans.  I know the land use and transportation, LUTS, committee of the City and County Management Association, of which I am a member, would be willing to look at such a policy area and at the implications, given, as Mr. Ryan mentioned, there are both positive and negative implications.  We would be more than willing to co-operate if the committee wishes to go down that road.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the other side, that is, the more positive action rather than the \"big stick\" action, in County Louth the LCDC, or local community development committee, which is a statutory committee, has produced its Healthy Ireland plan for the county.  This is largely a subset of the overall statutory plan - the local economic and community plan for County Louth.  Healthy Ireland is based on the premise that health and well-being is affected by all aspects of a person&rsquo;s life, including education, housing, financial status and physical environment.  The Healthy Ireland plan sets out to increase the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of life, reduce health inequalities, protect the public from threats to health and well-being and create an environment where every individual and sector of society can play its part in achieving a healthy Louth.<\/p> <p>  Goal 4 of the Louth community plan is about health and well-being and is to be achieved by providing environments and conditions that support healthy, self-directed, fulfilled and purposeful lives.  The Louth Healthy Ireland plan flows from national policy and objectives and it is about taking a positive and proactive approach to health and well-being, rather than using a regulatory approach, as would be the case in banning fast food outlets near schools.  It is about encouraging and educating people to take responsibility for their health and well-being from a very early age.  For example, the first objective is about active-friendly environments.  The plan asserts that in creating active-friendly environments, cycle lanes, playgrounds, well-lit paths, and so on, local authorities will engage with local communities, schools and other stakeholders to plan facilities that are appropriate to the needs of the community.  There are many examples of this.  We have a greenway along the shore of Carlingford Lough, where the local schools regularly take the children out on bicycles.  It is about getting results.  In the communications and knowledge sharing priority of the plan, the aim is to link communications expertise and capacity across sectors to ensure consistent, complementary, cutting-edge, accessible and persuasive health and well-being communication strategies are developed and implemented in full.<\/p> <p>  For children and young people, the emphasis in the plan is on creating opportunities for increasing activity and exercise.  There are also objectives in Louth around healthy eating, including plans to develop programmes to improve healthy eating for mothers-to-be, preconception, and for infants and children up to two years, along with an increase in breakfast clubs to offer a healthy breakfast to children from deprived backgrounds.  We are aiming at a preconception level with our promotion of the healthy eating and healthy lifestyle message to mothers in order that children are born into that atmosphere.  There is also an objective to provide healthy eating programmes in schools, youth facilities and sports organisations in order to increase the numbers of children and young people with a healthy weight.<\/p> <p>  As committee members can see, there is an option for local authorities to include policies and objectives around healthy living and healthy weights within the city or county development plan process.  There are also other areas, including the Healthy Ireland plans, where local authorities, in collaboration with other agencies, including the HSE, are setting out to work together with the aim of having a healthier population in the years ahead.  I suppose I am advocating a carrot rather than a stick approach.<\/p><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to meet the committee this morning and, as always, the CCMA stands ready to listen to its recommendations and assist its work in any way possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018101000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539160200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>There is certainly food for thought in both contributions.  One of the most important things to observe in terms of the built environment from Mr. Ryan's perspective is that for the most part, certainly from my community's perspective as a new developing community in Fingal in north Dublin, the vast majority of the towns and villages in my constituency are developing at a rapid rate.  This presents a wonderful opportunity for local authorities to approach it from a development perspective and add in public open spaces, recreation spaces, adult exercise equipment, playgrounds and sports campuses.  It is much more difficult to do this in more established communities.  In my capacity as Chairman of this committee, I was recently asked to present awards alongside David Gillick at a youth club in Dublin 1.  The event, which was sponsored by a health insurance firm and another private firm, was very beneficial to the children in question.  One of the remarks I heard from the teenagers was that there were very little city centre-based recreation facilities for them, which is a fair observation.  Obviously, Dublin city was developed at a time when pleasure parks were all the rage as opposed to running tracks, swimming pools and so forth.  It is a challenge for local authorities to build in facilities such as public parks, even on a small scale.  It is unlikely that a city centre development would accommodate a public open space of the size of Mountjoy Square or St. Stephen's Green but there are options.  If one looks at what Dublin City Council is doing to Mountjoy Square, one can see that what the council is trying to achieve with that public space, which has been a no-go area in the past, particularly after nightfall.  This is a positive development and it is nice to see the city approaching it from that perspective.  That is one of the observations I would make based on first-hand experience from Dublin 1 residents.  Young people had in mind what was on their doorstep to aid them in pursuing a healthy lifestyle in terms of physical exercise.<\/p> <p>  The \"no-fry\" zone approach some local authorities are considering is a cure rather than prevention.  The cure is to build through the local authority planning system opportunities for people, young and old, to avail of physical exercise.  The prevention element involves the actions some local authorities are taking to prevent fast food outlets from opening in close proximity to schools.  I accept both principles and I do not dismiss the witnesses' softer approach, with which I do not necessarily disagree.  It would be helpful if we developed central guidelines rather than having individual local authorities approach the matter on a county basis.  It would be helpful if the CCMA, in tandem with the Department, were to develop a policy on this in the development guidelines.  A centralised approach would be more beneficial than having this done by individual councils.<\/p> <p>  I have gone through what steps the various local authorities have taken on this, including Fingal County Council.  One of my local authority members, Councillor Tom O'Leary, proposed the introduction of a \"no-fry\" zone in Fingal County Council based on the Wexford example that was raised at this committee a number of months ago.  The proposal has gone to the appropriate strategic policy committee in the council for review.  I accept that it is not possible to close a fast food outlet.  One would even have to define what a fast food outlet is and review what a convenience store is in terms of what it is selling.  I accept, therefore, that this approach has pros and cons.<\/p> <p>  Would it not be better to empower local authorities to restrict the opening hours of such facilities, regardless of where they are located, whether within 200 m or 300 m or whatever other arbitrary figure we choose, to ensure they are not open at lunchtime?  As somebody who works in a village on Mondays and Fridays when I am not in the Oireachtas, I see school uniforms outside the chipper, which is less than 100 m from my office door.  It is quite depressing because it is more than a mile from the school but the students seem to have time to get to and from the chipper.  This happens every day.  Those children are then going home and having a full meal as well.  Would it be better to approach this issue from the point of view of opening hours?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018101000002#E00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539160200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>We would be capable of restricting opening hours as part of a developed management decision.

Do all local authorities feel as empowered as others?  Perhaps they do not exercise their authority in that way.  I cannot speak for every other local authority but my experience of Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council was that they approach this issue differently.  I accept the existence of the right referred to by Mr. Ryan.  The difficulty is that if a fast food outlet is located right next to a community school, as is the case in my constituency, it will open for breakfast and will be open throughout the day.

The restrictions we have on opening hours are similar to those that apply to building sites.  Opening hours often apply when housing developments are being constructed.<\/p><p>Those kinds of restrictions are well established.  There is long-established precedent, custom and practice so, if one went into court, one would be very confident.  I suppose the first question to have in mind, if a new type of measure is introduced, is how will a court approach it and whether a court will feel it was proper planning and development.<\/p><p> In terms of enforcement, in reality, the most likely way a council would act on something like that is if it got a complaint.  For example, if the principal of a school wrote in to say, \"This place is supposed to be closed at lunchtime and it was open yesterday\", we are legally obliged to investigate the complaint.  What I would point out is that the process of planning enforcement is long and tortuous, and it is not a quick-fix solution.  If somebody complains about something today and we then write out and say the business is not complying with its planning permission, and the business willingly and voluntarily changes its behaviour, that is fine.  However, if we end up having to go to court, it is a very long process.  With a new and very different type of condition, where somebody might say we were interfering with economic activity, or some other issue like that, it would be have to be tested.<\/p><p> Certainly, local authorities take their planning enforcement role seriously and we receive a very large number of complaints.  If we end up having to go through a legal process with all of those, it is an enormous and costly undertaking.

I am currently dealing with a case that I have dealt with many times in the past.  It can be very difficult.  However, very often, if we write out to somebody under a certain condition to say we have a complaint, that can be the end of it.

The Deputy is talking about the matrix that is set out which shows what is open for consideration in all of the different zones.  If the original draft plan is now in conflict with the policy that the council has adopted, the staff will have to go back and ensure that if there is to be no takeaway in this particular area then it is not open for consideration.  The plan cannot be in conflict with itself across its breadth but as we have said earlier, it is not a simple matter and there is the whole issue of ancillary use where something is permitted for development means and another use can also be allowed as long as it is ancillary.  It is a complicated area and one size does not fit all.  If it could always be dealt with in terms of a local plan area, the particular circumstances of a particular town or village could always be taken into account, but we would not go down to the level of doing local plan areas for every single town and village.  It is not easy.  Who knows what might happen with these plans?  They could be challenged or tested at some stage along the way.

When we are looking at building roads and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is awarding funding contracts, the delivery agent is the local county council.  In respect of the delivery of brand new roads, I refer to the N63 in Galway, where &euro;8.9 million has been spent on doing a particular section of about 2.5 km to 3 km in length and it is brilliant.  The road has been widened and realigned and a walkway and cycle path have even been put in but we forgot to put lights on it.  This is a suburban area of Galway city and when people come home in the evenings they cannot go out walking on it in the evening because it is dark for six months of the year and yet we are trying to promote people being active.  The local people had lobbied the council and TII quite heavily to put in the infrastructure to facilitate the residents going out to walk in the evening.  Is that not something that should be looked at nationally going forward?  When we are putting new infrastructure in place that goes through local towns and villages should we not put in the infrastructure to get people active and moving as well?

I presume that details around lighting should come as part of the broad premise but it depends on where the road is because national primary routes might not all be lit as the Deputy is aware, but in urban areas they generally are lit so that might be something to look at, broadly speaking.  It depends on the location of these projects and what their function is.  The function of a national primary route is broadly to remove large amounts of traffic nationally and a local route is for moving small amounts of traffic locally and I mean that in a broad sense.  That is commensurate to access for walking, cycling and so on.  Broadly speaking, maybe it should be looked at in respect of where this infrastructure is going in and I know that by and large, urban areas are lit.  They might be improved from time to time but by and large that is the case.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's previous point, the development plan is for a framework of development and on uses and zoning, there is generally a flexibility on the type of uses that could be looked at, which allows the local authority to make a decision that does not contravene the development plan.  In a town centre a range of uses will go in such as hotels, shops, takeaways, schools and other housing and the local authority is given the capability to make a call on that from a development management point of view.  The other issue is that then there is a development management point of view, namely, in the decision making around development applications and that has to be dealt with separately to the plan.  While it takes cognisance of the plan, as Ms Martin said, that might be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Those issues have to be taken into consideration in making the plan.  It is flexible enough and clear enough in terms of its intent but it has the operational capability on a day-to-day operational basis to make decisions that are in line with the proper plans for sustainable development in the area and in line with the zoning objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018101000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1539160200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I take on board what Mr. Ryan has said about the urban areas but if we go back to the road issue that is exactly my point because in the rural areas where there are upgrades it is not happening.

One is that if someone is driving on a road, the issue of moving from lit areas to dark areas is difficult for drivers.  When drivers get to the edge of a town it is better for them to go back into darkness and not to have odd lights here and there because it disturbs their night vision and there are road safety issues around that.

In Castlebar, County Mayo, there are delis beside the secondary schools where children can get chips, chicken rolls and sausage rolls, which are really unhealthy.  The deli counters are full at lunchtime.  The students are also buying bottles of Coke, or whatever else, with that meal.  How does one go about counteracting that from a planning perspective?  There are deli counters in filling stations and shops and delis have expanded to deal with the demand in local schools.  I do not see how rejecting a planning application for a Supermacs down the road will make a significant difference to that.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on cycleways and greenways.  It was my experience when I was on Mayo County Council that it was difficult to get a footpath or a greenway over the line.  There appears always to be a reason not do it.  When trying to build a footpath in a village to connect additional houses in order that people can walk to mass or to the football ground, I am given explanations such as the land required a compulsory purchase order, or that others will not agree to it, it will be costly, or the council does not have the staff to do it.  It is just \"Yada, yada, yada\".  There are always many reasons not to do it.  It is so difficult to get these projects over the line and they do not appear to be a priority for the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Ms Martin made the point about councillors changing every five years, which is a challenge.  Equally, the chief executive officers may change every seven years.  There is often rotation of staff between different sections within the council and, for example, the walking officer this year may not be the walking officer next year.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on longer term planning, for example when the executive changes or when the councillors rotate, so the plan does not get lost?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to Project Ireland 2040.  I have reservations about that plan because we are not delivering in 2018, never mind in 2040.  There needs to be a longer term perspective from the local authorities with fewer excuses and improved delivery.  When they are approached by people with ideas, they should not be thinking of reasons not to implement them.  They should only consider solutions.  In my experience it has been challenging to build simple, basic walkways.  I am not talking about top-end footpaths that one might have in the main street of a town.  Even gravel footpaths to the left or right of a thoroughfare, which are inexpensive, are proving very difficult to secure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018101000002#J00800","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539160200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's point about delicatessens, a shop is defined as selling something that is ancillary.

I have one question on foot of the contributions by Deputies Rabbitte and Chambers.  Mr. Ryan mentioned permeability.  As I am sure he will be aware, there are always conflicting views when building a new estate in an existing community.  One of the main issues in my local authority, particularly in my old electoral ward, is where an estate is added on to an existing development but the main road is not upgraded.  If one thinks of a linear development with housing along the road and a development at the back, the permeability is not there.  There is a deliberate attempt by the councillors to limit access to the main road directly through the existing linear development.  They route it around the road.  They might call it a distributor road.  It will come out at a particular point, which might be a few hundred metres from where the existing houses are located but there is no footpath linking the new road to the existing footpath network.  I wish it were only new developments but it is not.  I am referring to what are often ten-year old, 15-year old or 20-year old developments.<\/p> <p>  The councillors have the objective of limiting the ability of the planners to put in a footpath access point.  In certain instances, they might even close an access point.  It defies all logic, apart from when the objective is to address anti-social behaviour.  The greater good often has to be considered in these circumstances.  My question was about permeability and the ability of a local authority.  Perhaps in such instances the overarching perspective should overrule the perspective of one or two individuals on something and permeability should become a permanent element.  Otherwise we are spending public moneys, trying to facilitate access often through compulsory purchase orders.  I can name one which I am sure Deputy O'Reilly, my constituency colleague, is very much aware of on the Feltrim Road, where the owner of a small private house is refusing to facilitate a footpath which would benefit hundreds of houses.  Perhaps that was an observation rather than a question.  An overarching approach is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018101000002#K00600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539160200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>The Chairman has touched on the nub of the issue in urban development.  I accept Deputy's Rabbitte's point that when one is outside an urban settlement, there are different parameters and considerations.  At the root of the matter is the question of whether the issue is the promotion of permeability, which includes the linking of what might be seen as back-to-back housing estates or the linking of a housing estate to a town or village centre or something like that.  It is a general observation that it poses great difficulties for the local authority and planners with regard to its promotion.  It comes down to what I was trying to get at in my opening statement, which is the basic issue of linkage and infrastructure that allow people to move around the place more easily.<\/p> <p>  Senator Warfield pointed out that cyclists are vulnerable road users because they are forced onto larger roads where there is traffic.

From a bluntly practical point of view and from a local democracy point of view, local councillors are faced with a difficult decision to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018101000002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1539160200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I will be a small bit parochial to illustrate a broader issue.  In this instance, I am sure the Chairman will not object because I believe he shares the concerns I have.  Fingal County Council has an objective regarding the location of fast-food outlets.  I fully accept the point that was made earlier about local shops being turned into what are effectively fast-food outlets.  What is the difference between a chip and a wedge?  The lines get blurred.  Aggressive marketing techniques are employed by fast-food outlets.  Fingal County Council has an objective.  It has put its own flavour on that objective, which can be overlooked.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman will be more than acutely aware of an issue in Skerries because I am sure he has been involved just as I have.  In that case, objections have been lodged against the location of a fast-food outlet.  In the context of A Healthy Weight for Ireland, the obesity action plan, and, notwithstanding what was said about cycleways, this is right beside a school.  While the objectives are included in the local development plan, they can be ignored.  There does not seem to be any push to develop more stringent guidelines.  There does not seem to be any focus on ensuring that objective becomes a reality.  We can talk about things that we might be able to do into the future, things that cost a huge amount to build, and whether to use a compulsory purchase order.  The building of cycleways is extremely important but, in the intervening time, while we await the funding for cycleways and a decision on a compulsory purchase order, the objectives are still being bypassed.  This happened in Wicklow, Fingal and other areas as well.  If there is an objective in the local development plan, how can we ensure it is implemented, particularly where it relates to the siting of fast-food outlets and drive-through outlets within close proximity of schools?  The example I have given is also on a dangerous bend but I will not get into that in the context of the obesity strategy.  It is right beside a school.  Fingal County Council has objectives under the Healthy Ireland plan.  It says all the right things but how can we make sure that translates into practical action?  How can we ensure, as a community, that the proposals reflected in the local development plan are turned into reality for the kids who are in the school?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018101000002#K00800","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539160200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>The chief executive can only grant planning permission in accordance with the county development plan.

I do not want to sound pompous.  I am a former local authority member.  I really enjoyed my time on the local authority.  I went through two development plans as a local authority member.  However, it really needs to be instilled among local authority members that permeability, particularly in a built environment, has to be an integral part of a planning application and its granting because if one does not have permeability one has isolated island communities.  My constituency colleague and I would know of several desperate examples of bad planning in the county of Fingal dating back generations that have led to all sorts of problem from a social perspective because there are isolated islands of development with no footpath linkage, in one case, even after 40 years.  Permeability is key.  It aids healthy environments and healthy living.  It permits parents to have peace of mind.  Both Deputy O'Reilly and I are parents.  I would very much like to be able to allow my children to walk to school at some point in the future when they are old enough.  At present, I would not because it is not safe.  That is a regret.  I am sure it is a consideration of parents up and down the country.

Screening programmes are the health service asking people, on behalf of the State, to come forward.  This places increased responsibility on the health service to ensure the programmes are well run and organised.  That applies across the screening agenda, whether it be for colonic cancer,  breast cancer or cervical cancer.  Screening programmes are different in that way.  They are also different in that there is a balance to be struck between benefit and disbenefit in screening.  Breast screening is a good example because the active screening process exposes and has exposed some women to small levels of radiation which irradiate them.  That was certainly the case pre-digital mammography.  The benefit is that cancers will be detected early.  The benefit outweighs the disbenefit in a well run and well organised screening programme.  It it exactly the same with cervical screening.  A well run cervical screening programme should prevent up to 75% of cervical cancers or detect them at an early enough stage to allow effective treatment.<\/p> <p>  Along the way there is the issue of what happens when the screening slides do not reveal the cancer or the pre-cancerous changes.  That could occur for three reasons.<\/p><p>Even though the woman has an abnormality, no cells may be present in the slide, so the finding will be that the cells are normal and there is no problem.  Alternatively, cells may be present but the persons who are reading the slide, which are generally dealt with by more than one cyto-screener, may not spot an abnormality.  That may be for one or two reasons.  It may not be very distinct or it may be a matter of judgment and their judgment is that there is nothing significant.  Alternatively, it could be a very plain error where there are sufficient signs of abnormality but the person misses it.<\/p><p> I think a mechanism should be put in place to compensate a person due to an error which has potentially serious consequences.  It should be done in such a way as to avoid adversarial proceedings and there should be a system in place to cover, I would argue, all the screening programmes, and immunisation should be dealt with in that way.  In the UK, there is a system in place for immunisation where the Government has dispersed a very sizeable sum of money in compensation to a very small number of people who may be adversely affected by immunisation.  That is in recognition of the fact that immunisation happens for the benefit of everyone but some people have, for whatever reason, an extreme reaction where that has resulted in disability to a certain level and there is an expert view that it cannot be ruled out that it was caused by immunisation, and so compensation may be awarded.  A similar scheme would be appropriate in the case of screening.  We ask people to come to us to have testing done.  If they are failed by that through genuine error, there should be a mechanism to deal with that.  I hope that Mr. Justice Charles Meenan will consider that but it is outside the remit of our report.<\/p><p> With regard to open disclosure, if one goes back to the review of slides and the way it was conducted, it was initially conceived of as an educational process for the laboratories.  When CervicalCheck knew about cases of cervical cancer, remembering that it did not know about all cases, it sent a notification to the laboratories involved and those laboratories generally reviewed the slides.  In some cases, particularly those we are interested in, they had an alternative reading of that slide which indicated that there were changes visible that would have indicated a change in treatment.  The process was not designed to generate information to go back to CervicalCheck in particular.  It was meant for use by the laboratories themselves, for their own educational purposes about the performance of the laboratory and its staff.  Although a copy of the report came back, those were not aggregated or passed on to anyone.  There was a decision to put those in a structured and ordered fashion and gather that information.<\/p><p> That decision came about at a time when the Health Service Executive implemented its open disclosure policy.  A member of staff heard about it entirely fortuitously because that member of staff had been working in a hospital and still received some emails from that hospital, then received an email with an invitation to a meeting about open disclosure.  This person came back to CervicalCheck and said there was a new thing called open disclosure and that it needed to take it into account in what it was doing.  That is how open disclosure started to happen within CervicalCheck.  We know it was not done at all well.  As I made abundantly clear in the report, I find the open disclosure policy and guidelines that were in operation seriously deficient.  They were not so much open disclosure guidelines as a policy where clinicians were encouraged to disclose if they wanted to.  The guidelines gave them every chance of not disclosing and made it really easy for them not to disclose.  It was not really open disclosure at all.  That is why my recommendations are very plain and simple about open disclosure, particularly that there should be a statutory requirement for disclosure.<\/p><p> On the commission of inquiry, as the Chair correctly pointed out, it was not one of my recommendations, though it was my view.  My view is that we were fortunate enough, partly because of the increased timespan that we had, to be able to deal with a substantial number of the issues in substantial depth.  I was very cognisant of the view that had been expressed to me by quite a few of the women and relatives, that a major concern was to make sure that the screening service was fit and safe for their daughters and nieces in the future.  Such was the range of deficiencies that I identified that I made recommendations across that wide range to put the system right.  I feared that, if there was a move straightaway to a commission of inquiry, it would further delay the implementation of the recommendations and it would distract the system and the HSE in particular from getting on with doing what they should be doing.  As I said in my foreword, that was my personal view rather than a recommendation.  I would not have made it a recommendation because I would have been usurping the right of the Oireachtas to make that decision for itself and I have no business making a recommendation to the Oireachtas.

Sorry, that was just a bit of a joke.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their work.  I was embarrassed that they felt they needed to apologise about timelines in the beginning.  Their work is excellent.  It is one of the best reports we have seen in these Houses in my time, especially one delivered in a short time.  I have many questions but will prioritise them.  Some of the questions relate to the report and I have discussed that already.  I will not go over them because the witnesses have been quite accessible.  I have questions about the future and where we need to go.<\/p> <p>  The most important thing related to the report is that the recommendations are implemented as soon as possible.  We should work from that baseline and take that as our priority.  Everything else is subsequent to that.  It should be all about protecting this generation and future generations.  That is what the women who are affected, their families and patient advocates have as a priority too.  I have spoken to them numerous times.<\/p> <p>  I want to drill into the terms of reference the witnesses were given, which are partly our fault as legislators.  There is a lot of commentary on this issue.<\/p><p>Journalists and politicians need to be careful sometimes about the language they use because language is very important here.  Sometimes there has been a use of language which was not necessarily accurate.  Dr. Scally was not asked as part of the terms of reference to go in and investigate what happened in the 221 cases, as regards the laboratories themselves.  I believe that is something we probably left out.  I am not sure if he would have been able to do that anyway from a timeline point of view, but that did not happen.  I am aware there is an ongoing review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, but let us be clear, the investigation of the laboratories and the 221 cases, or whatever the number is - I think it is slightly more - was not part of remit.<\/p><p> In particular when we outsource such work, and also when we insource, contracts are in place and reviews are built in as part of that.  There would be built-in reviews as part of these contracts using organisations such as HIQA.  When the HSE became aware of issues, why did it not drill down into what was happening and investigate each of the cases?  Why did it not happen?  Will it ever happen?  Will we ever find out what happened in each individual case?  Will we drill into the detail of each individual case as regards the people who were looking at the slides, the fact that they were misread and that the information was not brought to the attention of management?  Why did that not happen?  According to the contracts which I have looked at, there were meant to be regular inspections but they did not happen.  There were five inspections over eight years.  Issues did arise in the inspections but they were not followed up.  That was a failure.  Why did that not happen?<\/p><p> I am sorry for asking all these questions.  No inspection has been carried out since 2014.  Is that acceptable? On the errors, probably the most important finding was that the laboratories appear to be statistically in line with international norms in their findings, but how do we know that is corroborated in the 221 cases by follow-up investigations in the individual cases?  Does Dr. Scally follow what I am saying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#C00500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Dr. Scally could not get into that detail.

I think that is likely.  We must go back to the way this review was run.  It was entirely unsatisfactory in that they only looked at the cases of cervical cancer that they knew about, so they did not get a full data set, as happens with breast cancer, of all the cervical cancers from the cancer registry, which is the most complete register.  They ran an alternative register of their own and the only cases they knew about were the ones they heard about or were notified within the screening service.  That is not a good basis for a review, and it does not give one the kind of population data that would allow one to say how many cases of slides being wrongly or differently interpreted post a diagnosis of cervical cancer there were over the entire cervical cancer programmes in the country.

If a very experienced cytologist is presented with a slide to look at from someone they know has got cervical cancer, he or she will spend a lot more time and attention to it and find more things than would be found by a cervical screener looking at the slide within a fixed time span within a whole batch of slides.

My comment also applies to the medical advisory committee but that was the only meeting of the lead colposcopists in the ten years of the existence of CervicalCheck.  There was an annual educational meeting for the colposcopy community but otherwise this was the only one.  Colposcopists did not feel part of CervicalCheck, even though CervicalCheck funded them via the hospitals and they often worked in clinics with CervicalCheck branding on them.  They were given no role or input into the development of the review or any of its seven iterations and they felt quite alienated from the whole organisation.  They did not like the idea that they were expected to talk to women about their results and this did not go well.  Some behaviour was terrible and this was front and centre in my report.  These attitudes have no place in medicine and it would make any doctor ashamed to hear the comments.  On the other hand, some disclosure was done well.

I absolutely welcome that.  People had the opportunity to vote for that twice in the recent past.  They did not do so but the unfortunate events we are discussing will, I hope, put a bit of focus on open disclosure.  It is regrettable that it will take legislative underpinning to make it happen but if it does, that is fair enough.  There were descriptions of a paternalistic attitude in how the women were spoken to, which takes away from much of the good work done in the health service.  I would love to be in a position to say I was wildly shocked by this attitude but, as a woman who uses the health service, I was not shocked.  Is Dr. Scally confident that we can address that situation and change it?<\/p> <p>  I remember that the decision taken to outsource services was purely political and no clinician advised that outsourcing should happen.  When the then Minister was questioned about it she said it was good value for money but nobody ever said there was a good, sound, clinical reason for it.  It was outsourced and then re-outsourced.  Dr. Scally talked about the medical advisory committee not meeting.  He expressed surprise at the level of quality assurance and said it was not in line with best international practice.  Presumably, according to best international practice the person in charge would have sight or knowledge of the slide and would know where it was.  Slides appear to have been sent to one site in the United States and then outsourced to another site.<\/p><p>Honolulu is more widely recognised as a holiday destination than a centre of excellence for medicine or laboratories.  How can Dr. Scally and members have confidence that everything was in order when the laboratory there does not apply the ISO standard which I understand to be a benchmark and we do not know how many tests were outsourced to it?  Members have asked that question on several occasions.  The first time it was put to representatives of the HSE was at a Wednesday meeting of this committee, and the impression was given that we would have the results by the following Friday and that it was simply a case of someone in the HSE pressing a button to give us the breakdown of which labs were doing what.  We still do not have that information.<\/p><p> While the average standard in the laboratories may be acceptable, some of the labs could be out of line.  We have no way of knowing whether the lab in Honolulu was out of line with what is considered international best practice or international norms.  Has Dr. Scally tried to ascertain the figures on what slides went where, who looked at them and whether there were any outliers in that regard?  We have asked for that information but, unfortunately, we have not been given it.  We want a detailed lab-by-lab breakdown which we can examine.  I am not comfortable relying on averages.  As a colleague of mine used to say, if a person has one foot in a bucket of boiling water and the other in a bucket of ice, the person&rsquo;s two feet are wrecked but, on average, the temperature is fine.  Averages do not tell us anything.  We are seeking a detailed breakdown for each lab.  Is it possible for Dr. Scally to obtain that?<\/p><p> On contract governance and the shredding of contracts after ten years, I too was quite taken by the efficiency with which that was done.  As one quite familiar with the HSE, I can state that it does not have a reputation for being hugely efficient.  However, it certainly was efficient in this aspect.  Is it possible to get copies of the contracts from the laboratories in the United States?  The contracts could be examined in regard to the re-outsourcing.  I am concerned that, while there does not appear to have been a very deep and meaningful relationship with the contracted labs in the US, there was no relationship with the labs to which the tests were subsequently outsourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#E01200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Dr. Denton will answer some of the queries on the laboratories.

One of the good things about contracting is that some of the quality standards that are demanded in Irish contracts are higher than the US standards.  For example, there is a limit on the number of slides that screeners can look at.  During her visits, Dr. Denton has been looking at the screener records to ensure they are accurate.

It appears superficially that there are differences in the rates of certain categorisations from the various laboratories.  The problem is that these differences are very difficult to interpret.  There could be perfectly legitimate reasons for them.  One of the things that makes it particularly difficult to interpret the data that CervicalCheck has collected, and is still collecting, is that it includes samples taken from colposcopies, which tend to be taken from women who are already known to have abnormal smears.  This increases the rate of abnormality significantly, which means that the proportion of the slides which come from colposcopy determines the abnormal rate for that laboratory.  Obviously, this is not satisfactory.  That is why it has been recommended that the data specification should be altered to exclude such samples.  A number of recommendations were made about improving the quality and robustness of data to allow for links with other factors which we know to have an influence on the rate of abnormality.  If all of those recommendations are implemented, they will give a CervicalCheck a toolbox for making meaningful comparisons between the laboratories.  I feel that should be a priority.  It might transpire that there are differences which require further investigation, and such investigation might or might not indicate that there is a problem.  CervicalCheck cannot start to discuss or consider that until it has robust data to work from in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karin Denton"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Denton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#G00800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Scally and his team for a comprehensive report which deals very well with all of the issues.

Did it occur to front-line staff that they should go back and look at the smears that had previously been taken?  Did front-line staff raise concerns to the central management system of CervicalCheck at any stage?  Dr. Scally said earlier that there seemed to be a disconnect between front-line people and central management.  Did he conduct an examination to ascertain whether people who were involved in CervicalCheck on a front-line basis might have dropped out at an earlier stage because of their concerns about central management?  Does any documentation indicate that concerns were raised at a far earlier stage, perhaps before the audit was done?<\/p> <p>  The second question I would like to ask relates to the number of cases covered by the audit.  It was decided to do an audit.  As I understand it, the front-line staff were not aware that the audit was being done.  Why was that information kept from the people who were dealing with the patients?  It was only at a later stage that they became aware of the audit and the results of the audit.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to ask about the period of time that elapsed between smears being done and people being identified with cancer.  Were there some cases in which the all-clear was given six or 12 months earlier?  We have heard about cases in which mistakes were made in the reading of smears not once but twice.  Serious questions are raised when a patient's smear is misinterpreted on two occasions.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to raise with Dr. Scally the number of people we have in the country and the number of front-line clinicians here.  I understand there are approximately 135 consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country, even though all the reports indicate that we should have 180.  Do we have a sufficient number of people working on the front line at the moment?  If not, what would be a sufficient number, based on a comparison between the ratio in this country and the ratio in other countries?  Should we have many more people with the requisite expertise dealing with this area?  What do we need to do to get more people into this area?  I am raising this aspect of the matter in the context of the need to provide a far more comprehensive service and ensure the same errors are not made again.<\/p> <p>  The final matter I would like to raise is the educational process.  This will not give an exact result every time.  Regardless of the system that is introduced, there will be a failure in it.  I understand that cervical cancer does not identify womb cancer.  A clinician told me recently that there has been a huge increase in womb cancer in this country.  It seems that there is some connection with the increase in obesity.  I am not clear what the connection is.  There is a higher incidence of womb cancer where there is obesity.  The level of education regarding this issue has not been as comprehensive as we would need it to be.  I wonder what Dr. Scally would do to get information out there.  We need to make sure information is made available at an earlier stage to those who have a higher ratio of risk.<\/p> <p>  I will recap some of the issues I have raised.  I referred to a ratio.  I asked about the time gap between being given the all-clear and the cancer being identified.  Has any information been identified in that regard yet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#G01100","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Burke for a varied group of questions.  Dr. Denton and I will try to provide some answers between us.  The Senator asked whether the colposcopists were aware.  I believe they had some awareness that a review was going on.

There is a clear breakdown in the report of what happened when the cases were being re-examined.<\/p><p>Although the bulk of the cases where a review was needed concerned cytopathology, there were also cases where there were possible failings in colposcopy or in the administrative system.  Therefore the colposcopists would have known something was going on in that regard.<\/p><p> The major problem was that their connection and engagement with CervicalCheck was very poor.  I logically expected that there would have been routine meetings.  These were very important people in the whole process of cervical screening and looking after women whose smears were abnormal.  I would have expected that there would have been regular meetings.  After all, the health service was funding those clinicians to work for CervicalCheck as part of the screening programme.  There was not that engagement with them and they certainly were not involved in the construction of the review and the audit process.

I understand there are pressures on the workforce in terms of seeing all the women in a timely fashion.  That was not specifically part of our remit.  I agree with Dr. Scally that the most important thing is that they were not engaged with the programme.  They were signed up to management meetings and they were not involved in drafting policy.

It may well have happened.  Certainly at the time of the outsourcing of the laboratory work, there was clear evidence of cytopathologists being extremely unhappy about that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the overall numbers, workforce planning was not part of our remit.  However, we made it clear in the report that there needed to be a workforce review of the cervical screening programme to ensure it was properly staffed and had proper access to the expertise it needed.  One of the most important recommendations is that there should be a national screening committee because the means of making policy decisions on the screening programmes, including issues relating to staffing, is quite unclear.  There needs to be a national screening committee with expertise and independence which can advise about the programmes, about new programmes and about any changes or modifications needed to existing programmes.  That does not exist, which is why it is one of our key recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Education is extremely important.  I take that two ways.  I draw the committee's attention to one thing I did not address in the report and perhaps should have done.  There is no requirement for training in taking samples or indeed working with women to have a successful cervical screening experience, in other words, getting a good sample and getting the consent of the woman.  Some very good training is carried out, but it is entirely voluntary.  I wonder whether that should be compulsory and that a modicum of training should be provided for all the clinicians involved in taking the samples and dealing with the women, if only to ensure they can explain properly to the woman what is happening and also in the context of the whole programme shifting quite significantly next year to the HPV testing as a primary test, which will be much more accurate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I seek clarification.

When they came forward with those symptoms they were told they had just had a normal smear, they had no need to worry, and that they should go away and come back if it did not stop.  There seems to be a failure of education there in that the staff did not understand that the test might not pick up everything and that serious symptoms should be dealt with on a serious basis irrespective of when they occur.  There was some evidence of delays in the treatment of women because of them having had a normal smear and it was regarded that it could not possibly be a serious cervical cancer issue.<\/p> <p>  Education of staff is extremely important.  Education of patients on cancer in general about early recognition of symptoms is also important.

One of the most distressing aspects was the degree to which many of the women with whom I interacted had lost confidence in their treating clinicians.  I was really disturbed by that.  It was brought home to me in the first of the meetings I had with the women in Dublin early in the process.  Two young women came to that meeting and sat down beside each other, purely by accident, and found that they knew each other, were from the same place and had been at school together.  They were both in the same boat with having cancer.  Both of them believed that they had not been told or disclosed to properly when they should have been.  They had both lost confidence in their clinicians who had been looking after them.  As they were discussing this, they discovered that they had both decided to shift to the other's clinician.  They thought this was very funny.  It was the only light-hearted moment in the meeting.  It brought home to me how difficult this is for many women, and we are still not through that at all.<\/p> <p>  At the outset I said, and I hold it even more strongly to be true, that when things go wrong, there are three things patients want to happen.  First, they want to be told what went wrong and why.  Second, they want someone to say sorry for something having gone wrong, and they want it to be someone who means it.  Getting a letter from the chief executive, or the same letter being sent to all those affected, really does not cut it in this regard.

The system needs to get better at convincing women that this is a good service, that they should come to it and that they would be welcomed to it and looked after properly.

I asked the question before of the HSE, when we were trying to get to where Dr. Scally got in his investigation, but it was pretty much dismissed.

The figures at which we can look are not telling us about the women with cancer who are being missed.  They are telling us about the proportion of women who have abnormalities detected.  The majority will not have cancer, but there will be changes which, if left untreated, might at some point over many years develop into cancer.  It is not an absolute measure of a laboratory's ability to prevent cancer from developing, but it is a reasonable surrogate because they are data that are relatively easy to get and are current.<\/p> <p>  Much of the problem is that when there is a look-back, many of the samples in respect of which the diagnoses were altered may have been taken many years before.  Although it tells us something useful, it does not necessarily tell us how a laboratory is functioning today.  It is important to keep the two matters separate.  There is no measure of how likely it is a laboratory will miss a diagnosis that will lead to cancer in a sample reported today.  We simply cannot measure it.  As a surrogate, we look at how good they are in detecting precursor abnormalities today, which we can do.<\/p> <p>  On real-time monitoring, that is the best we can do.  The audit tells us something different, which is what it should be doing from the point of view of improving laboratory practice, namely, identifying samples where a diagnosis was missed.  It could have been difficult, as Dr. Gabriel Scally said, but could then be used to feed into training and supervision.  I would think it would be unusual for a poorly performing individual member of staff to be detected through the audit because it would be too late.  They already have been reporting for five years at that point.  Accordingly, many of the quality assurance measures at which we look are process measures such as how does one check up on members of staff, monitor their performance and detect problems in real time.

In that way, he or she would go about it in an unbiased manner.<\/p> <p>  How many other countries or jurisdictions have screening programmes similar to the one that operates here and how do those programmes compare?  Do they work better than ours?  Are they more accurate?  What are the comparative statistics in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to inoculation programmes in various countries and the fact that there can be reactions in some cases.  Is it possible to identify patients, with any degree of accuracy, who may react to a particular inoculation programme?  It would be hugely beneficial to all practitioners if that were possible.  Finally, are the witnesses satisfied that the recommendations in the report will be implemented unconditionally?  There is no sense in the witnesses having gone to all the trouble to which they went in order to examine the issues if their recommendations are not taken into account and put into operation immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#L00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan has asked an interesting set of questions.  On open disclosure and how it operates, the acid test is how it operates in hard cases.  These were hard cases and it operated badly.  I would like to be able to say that there is really good experience elsewhere but I cannot do so.  The hyponatraemia inquiry in Northern Ireland, for example, with which I had some involvement, actually uncovered a much worse situation of cover up, lies and dishonesty among clinicians.  I am deeply disappointed that medical colleagues would behave in that sort of way.  When it comes to hard cases, there is an element of collegiality in the medical profession that is sometimes good but at other times, unhelpful.  It can be really unhelpful when it comes to telling patients and authorities the truth when things are going wrong.  I am very hopeful that this can and will be changed.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of switching clinicians, I do not know if the women went ahead with doing that.  I was hoping to ask them that last night but as they did not come along, I could not do so.  Like Deputy Durkan, I would like to know more.  I do not know if they have done so but I suspect that they may have gone ahead and switched clinicians.  Sometimes it is easier to start afresh with a different clinician and to build a new relationship, especially if there is any resistance to going back, sitting down and speaking the truth to each other.  That is difficult.  I look forward to hearing about that.  I worry about the fact that women continue to tell me that they are worried about their relationships with their clinicians because of all of this.  They would love resolution to it and I would hope that they find it.  I would certainly encourage any attempts that might be made in that regard.  I know that some of the women would like to sit down with their clinicians and discuss what happened in the light of my report and of everything that has happened.  They would very much like to say how they feel about what happened and would like their clinicians to tell them honestly about what went on.  I know that some women would like that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan's question about the inaccuracy of the test being used as an excuse for complacency is interesting.  I will think on that further but certainly some of the clinicians in their dealings with women dismissed things that went wrong on the basis that everyone knows that the test is not completely accurate.<\/p><p>I agree with the sentiment that lies behind the Deputy's question that it is not right or helpful.  It is our duty to make the tests as accurate as we possibly can.  I am hopeful that the shift next year to the HPV vaccine, which is a much more accurate test, will reduce that problem.<\/p><p> On the question about inoculation, we are not really here to discuss immunisation but part of the issue with it is that there are people who should not be immunised because of the likelihood of them reacting to a vaccine.  They are then entirely dependent on the rest of the population who can have the vaccine having the vaccine.  I wish there was a way to identify everyone who reacts but, sadly, that is not possible.  It comes back to what I was saying at the beginning about a compensation scheme that runs in the UK for immunisation.  It is a limited amount of money and there is a high level of disability involved in the judgments about that.  It is an important thing to look at nonetheless.  I invite Dr. Denton to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>There are a couple of other questions the Deputy asked that were laboratory specific.  On whether the perceived accuracy of the test had an impact on those doing the audit, I heard two aspects of that: the clinicians and the laboratories.  Having spoken to people in all the laboratories, I found they were all committed and keen to look again at the slides and learn what they could from them.  It interacts with the question of bias, however, because they knew these women had all developed cervical cancer.  Different individuals had different approaches to how much they tried to compensate for that bias, but it was not their fault because no one told them what to do.  There was no protocol that said one either must or must not compensate for this review bias.  The clinicians were all keen to learn what they could from reviewing these slides.<\/p> <p>  The protocol, such as it was, listed cases that had to go for an external review, and this can be found on pages 86 and 87 of the report.  Slides that were identified on internal review as having a significant difference were sent for an external review, which addresses the question the Deputy asked of whether there was another pair of eyes on them.  The difference between those internal reviews and the subsequent external reviews is what precipitated CervicalCheck to wonder if there might be an issue with the internal reviews.<\/p> <p>  I was also asked about how many other countries do an audit like this, and the answer is not many.  It is quite unusual.  The one we are most familiar is that which runs in England and Wales.  It should be recognised that trying to do the audit is a laudable thing, but not every country does it, and most countries have not had this experience.

When it comes to the hard cases, it sticks in our craw to come out and say it.  I thank the Chairman for his introduction, which gets me going.  I also thank Dr. Scally and his colleagues for the work they are doing.<\/p><p> My remarks and questions relate to the position, comfort and status of girls and women in Ireland.  There is something going on here that goes beyond what is in the eye of this storm.  It goes to the heart of how comfortable, included and well-treated women and young girls are in this country.  Dr. Scally spoke of ensuring this would become an increasingly rare event and said he was honoured to meet and talk to many of the women concerned and took great encouragement from their help and support.  Those remarks need to be underlined and repeated.<\/p><p> Does Dr. Scally have a view on whether there may be governance and organisational issues that stretch from the Oireachtas?  This committee deals with health and has a relationship with the Department of Health and Health Service Executive.  While it is easy for us to talk about what happened elsewhere, everything that happens elsewhere is subject to oversight and responsibility.<\/p><p> No one would regard CervicalCheck screening or other health screening programmes as anything other than very positive developments.  As time goes on, I expect there will be more of these proactive interventions to try to catch nasty conditions before they come our way.  I am intrigued that despite our good motives, we have had unnecessary deaths and cases of near death, which have caused major anxiety?  I would appreciate any observations on that.<\/p><p> Speaking about the issue of open disclosure, Dr. Scally stated that many of the attitudes displayed by clinicians have no place in medicine.  He then spoke about attitude and culture and indicated he was hopeful that the culture would change.  He said that open disclosure had to be the rule rather than part of a menu.  What else will be necessary to encourage this change of culture?  Dr. Scally spoke about collegiality being both a good and bad thing.  This is evident in other areas of public service, including policing.<\/p><p> Dr. Scally spoke strongly on compensation being a core element, if I understood him properly.  Should a compensation fund become part of the cost of providing a service?  One will always hope that one does not fully expend it but it strikes me that if there is to be open disclosure and honesty, we must all be honest with people.  This means saying that sometimes, even with the best will, honest mistakes will be made.  We must have an upfront system that tries to remediate that.<\/p><p> Dr. Scally refers to the range of deficiencies he found.  He made 50 recommendations and may have made a 51st recommendation this morning.  We have had 25 or more years of tribunals, inquiries and scandals.  It strikes me that this could, sadly, become another inquiry with a big report, which lays out all the issues.  If Dr. Scally met someone at a bus stop or in a waiting room and the person realised who he was and asked him what are the three, four or five things that need to happen to turn this around, what would he say?<\/p><p> We have had a love affair with finding people and entities to blame and responsibility must be borne.  However, when something like this happens we need to immediately start to right the ship in whatever way we can and get a better system in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#N04500","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539158400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Senator Colm Burke took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for a fine set of questions.  He asked about the Oireachtas and its potential role in this matter.  I will link that with his final comment on finding people to blame.  It is undoubtedly true that there is an appetite to find people to blame.  In this situation, I do not know where one stops.  Senator Dolan invited me to speak about the role of the Oireachtas and politicians in all of this.  A reason we have this problem, as Dr. Denton has indicated, is that cervical screening is relatively recent in this country, having been in place for only the past ten years.  It has been in place in the UK for 20 years and in a number of other European countries for much younger.  I find it difficult to understand why it took an eight-year pilot before the programme was introduced.  An eight-year pilot for a programme that has been well tried and tested elsewhere does not make sense to me.  I have no idea why that occurred.<\/p> <p>  As the Senator will have gathered from the report, I am critical about the removal of the external governance of the HSE and that situation going on for so long.  I am very pleased that it has been restored and with the appointment of the chair.  A fine chairman has been chosen and I have confidence in that person.  It is very unfortunate that certain things happened, for example, the decision to postpone the implementation of the HPV vaccination.  I am very pleased that is in place now and that vaccination are on the way up.  There was a decision to postpone its implementation.<\/p> <p>  As I have expressed already, I am a strong advocate - I hope there is no longer any argument about it - for the necessity of a statutory duty of candour being placed on individuals.  The Oireachtas had the opportunity to do that and chose not to, for whatever reason.  One can look at the entire system, from legislators all the way down to people on the ground, and find things that did not go well.  I said I am hopeful that the culture will change.  By nature, I am an optimist, but I come from Belfast where there is a saying that an optimist is someone who has not heard the bad news yet.<\/p><p>I hope there will not be bad news about these 50 recommendations.  I hope they will be implemented and that the country will get the cervical screening service it deserves.  I will certainly be doing what I can and what I am asked to do to help in that respect.<\/p><p> Regarding changing the culture, I have indicated in the report that certain provisions need to be put in place, including a national screening committee centre.  On the Deputy's question on the future of other programmes, particularly in this modern age of genetics, I am quite confident other screening programmes will come forward.  Ireland does not yet have a proper mechanism for looking at screening in a highly professional and consistent way, which is why I have recommended that a national screening committee be put in place.  That would serve the country well in the future and would enable a rational approach to screening and oversight.  <\/p><p> It will not have escaped the Deputy's attention that among my recommendations I made two regarding matters I have mentioned.  I recommended there should be patient advocates on the board of the HSE.  I also recommended that there should be patient advocates on the national screening committee, and I have made other similar recommendations in the report.  I have been deeply impressed by the advocacy shown by some of the people affected, notably Vicky Phelan, who exposed much of it.  I was also deeply impressed by some of the patient advocates involved in the Madden committee some time ago.  I would encourage that approach to involving patient advocates at the highest level but with one caveat.  I recall one day chairing a committee, on which we had  included patient advocates, and as I looked around those attending it occurred to me that the only people who were not being paid to be there were the patient advocates.  I am conscious that is unfair and exploitative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":678,"content":"<p>It must be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":679,"content":"<p>There are people with respect to this issue who are making enormous sacrifices to try to aid and move it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":681,"content":"<p>We should not in any sense be seen to be exploiting patient advocates.

I firmly believe that.<\/p> <p>  Another element is to ensure there is a better understanding of citizenry among the citizens of the Republic of Ireland.  I am still not convinced that the people do not have too deferential an idea of doctors.  They need to be more robust in dealing with the medical profession and to have higher expectations of doctors.  The public should not hold them in awe any longer.  Those days have long gone.  I hope this report and the exposure of some of the ridiculous attitudes that they hold will encourage the public to be intolerant.  Because I come from Belfast I am an advocate of intolerance at times.  Being intolerant of doctors who are patronising and sexist is a good thing to be.  I would encourage people to address that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of compensation, the Deputy's point was very well made.  Part of the cost-benefit analysis of a screening programme should include issues of compensation for those who are actively damaged by the screening programme just as it needs to take into account the physical damage that can sometimes be caused by over-investigation as a result of a screening test, or the anxiety that results from having a screening test and then having to wait a very long time for the results.  That is a stress on people that should be avoided if at all possible.<\/p> <p>  I firmly believe that patients turn to lawyers and litigation as a last resort in the absence of any other way of getting their issues dealt with.  The best way of stopping the lawyers getting involved and the costs associated with that is to return to the points elements I mentioned, namely, telling patients what has gone wrong and why, getting someone who is responsible to say \"sorry\" and mean it, and assuring them that everything will be done to try to ensure it is not repeated.  All the evidence from across the world shows that if that is done properly the public is much less likely to go to court to seek satisfaction.  I have seen it happen many times where people go to court, sue and the only way the courts have of responding to that is in terms of a financial settlement.  Such a settlement may be fine in one sense, but it does not bring resolution for many people.  I look forward to Mr. Justice Meehan's proposals and to reading what he has to suggest in regard to that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding three, four or five key points, one is open disclosure; the second is a national screening committee; the third is that screening services need to be brought out of the cold, given a higher profile within the HSE and better management; and the fourth, which is a negative rather than a positive point, we should not indulge in the blame game anymore that we have to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Deputies Kelly and O'Connell want to raise two brief issues and then I will bring in Senator Swanick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00800","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>In fairness, Senator Swanick should speak before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00900","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I had to step out to deal with a Commencement Matter in the Seanad.

In the last week, it has become an issue of higher importance for the inquiry team and today it becomes an issue of huge importance for us.  The comment on patient advocates is spot-on.  Demographically, it is impossible to get the appropriate people to sit on all of these groups unless there is going to be some form of recompense for their time off work.  One will not get people of my age or younger to join a group because of the cost of child care and so on.  That must be dealt with and as a committee we should advocate a payment.<\/p> <p>  We will not get to it now, but the RCOG review will not deal with the question I have asked about why the laboratories were not investigated under their contracts when issues were found.  That needs to be dealt with somewhere.  In fairness to Dr. Scally, he has said that quality control was, in effect, a joke and was not in place after 2014.  We do not even know what was going on or who was accountable.  All of that must be encapsulated somewhere.  It is a big chunk that was missing.  It is no one's fault, but it is missing.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the inquiry team's follow-up work on the laboratories and outsourcing.

Those backlogs will continue to increase as long as the number of samples carries on at current levels.

It is a real problem.<\/p> <p>  The cervical cytology slides themselves do not really have a life-span problem.  They will last more than long enough to allow them to be properly reported.  The problem comes with the HPV testing which is currently undertaken as a reflex for certain grades of abnormality because that has a lifespan limit.  We are probably getting quite close to the point at which some women may not be able to have the reflex HPV test because it is out of date.

According to the report, CervicalCheck organised the training of those responsible for imparting that information, so it is, surely, at fault for the poor training in that regard.<\/p><p>My main concern is that before any of this started I assumed that CervicalCheck checked the slides.  I assumed there was a lab somewhere with people checking slides.  We now know that doctors or nurses take smears in the community and labs abroad test some of the samples.  Page 26 of the report details the organisational structure of CervicalCheck.  If outside services were responsible for the testing and screening, the people whose roles are detailed on page 26 seem to have only been administering a service.  As they only had one meeting in ten years and nobody was joined up, they do not seem to have had any proper role.  The early part of the report twice refers to nobody being in charge.  A concern of mine is that in January 2014 the NSS moved into the directorate of health and well-being.  I cannot see any logical reason for that and such is not detailed in the report.  Is there any reason for that move?<\/p><p>On the job description, although it is a funny anecdote it is very serious because even in the smallest business one is required to have a job description.  It is very easy to ensure it is in place.  I worked in the NHS.  It is very easy to make sweeping statements that the NHS or the HSE is dysfunctional but this is a prime example of an arm of the organisation that is as bad as we could imagine.<\/p><p>On page 29 there is a reference to the recession.  Is that the only excuse for incompetence that was offered to Dr. Scally?  It seems like a fairly weak excuse.<\/p><p>On page 30 it states: &ldquo;The QA Committee had a number of subgroups that concentrated on the development of standards for key functions in the screening process, such as cytopathology, primary care, histopathology, colposcopy and administration.&rdquo;  Is there a reason screening standards were not included in that or am I missing something?<\/p><p>The report states on page 32 that all was not well in the screening process.  On what evidence is that comment based?  Do we know anything about why CPL stopped screening in 2013?  Is there any reason for that other than financial concerns?<\/p><p>The National Screening Service risk register report for October 2017 is quoted on page 35 as stating, &quot;<i>Clinical Audit process established and embedded in CervicalCheck by December 2017.<\/i>&quot;The report then states: &quot;This is also difficult to understand, as the audit process commenced many years previously.&quot;  Discussion of the audit process began in 2009.  It seems the relevant CervicalCheck staff were just making forms, creating standard operating procedures, having meetings and basically doing nothing.<\/p><p>Although he may not have wanted an answer to the question, Dr. Scally asked why there was an eight-year pilot and why it took so long to roll out the HPV vaccine.  We were coming from a very primitive background in this country in terms of women&rsquo;s health.  If one looks at the media coverage of the roll-out of screening and the HPV vaccine, one will note comments by some religious organisations that one would not need a HPV vaccine if one led a pure and chaste life.  That is the reason for the delay.  There was huge pushback when the Minister for Health at the time, Ms Mary Harney, brought in cervical screening.  Connections were made between a person's lifestyle and positive screening results.  There was also significant pushback against HPV testing from what could be called interest groups or destructive people, which contributed to the low vaccination rate.  The primitive attitude to women&rsquo;s health held by some in Ireland is probably the answer to the question to which Dr. Scally may not have wanted an answer.  We are now beginning to catch up in that regard, albeit far later than would be ideal.<\/p><p>I am very concerned that this arm of the HSE which employed all these people who were getting paid big money, judging by the wage bill, some of whom were eminently qualified rather than people who came in off the street, seems like such a basket case of an organisation that it could not even manage its data right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#R00700","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I am having difficulty disentangling the questions from the observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Scally to do his best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#R00900","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":716,"content":"<p>That is normal for Deputy O&rsquo;Connell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#R01000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":717,"content":"<p>It is normal enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#R01100","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I am happy to respond to some of the questions in detail in writing.

However, also within the contract - it may have been at clause 39, I cannot remember off the top of my head - was that this facility for subcontracting out and giving away slides was included in case one's plant went on fire.  That is my reading of it.  I have looked into it and my reading of it was that the clause - I think it was clause 39 - was there so that if 1,000 slides were coming from Ireland and the laboratory burned down or another disaster happened they could be sent elsewhere.  It is under that line that the laboratory was saying they could be sent to Honolulu or wherever they were sent.  To my mind that is breach of contract.

I know that sometimes the right hand side of the room is a bit difficult to see.  An improvement in the Acting Chairman's peripheral vision is needed.  Two questions come to mind.  First, Dr. Scally made an interesting reference a few minutes ago in respect of the chain of command.  This is something we have raised at these meetings on many occasions.  Is there a chain of command?  To what extent does it work?  It used to be a product of the old health boards.  In the health boards there was a programme manager who was responsible for a series of issues and protocols.  He or she was regularly held responsible for those.  I believe that has disappeared and does not exist any more.<\/p> <p>  The other question that comes to mind, to which reference has already been made, relates to tendering.  I used to be a kind of half-expert on tendering once upon a time and in a different capacity.  To what extent did visits take place to the laboratories that were likely to tender?  Were all laboratories visited?  Were the terms set out in the tender documents such as to ensure that all possibilities were catered for in the future, including the issues about ISO standards and so on?  Whenever I see reference to tendering I get uneasy.  It is a feeling which has affected me on many occasions in the past.  I wonder about that.  Are there grounds for optimism in respect of the tendering process?  How was it gone about?  Who actually promoted it?  Who was in charge of it?  How were the tenders opened?  Were they opened in public?  Perhaps Dr. Scally would like to comment on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#T04700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":805,"content":"<p>I do not have answers on those points, as Deputy Durkan will understand, but they are valuable and we will include them in the work we are doing.

The purpose of our first session is to consider a Government motion to exercise the right to opt in, pursuant to Protocol 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to two measures in the civil justice area.  The first is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No. 1393\/2007 on the service in the member states of judicial and extra judicial documents in civil or commercial matters, that is, the service of documents.

The three-month period during which Ireland can make the necessary notifications of our intention to participate in the adoption and application of a proposed measure is linked with the timing of that proposed measure becoming available in all official EU languages.  We became aware during the summer recess that all language versions of one of the proposals which is before the committee today were available with effect from 18 July, and that the effective date in respect of the other proposed measure was 25 July.  As the proposals are being dealt with together in the interests of efficiency, it is the intention that the required notifications will be made by 18 October.  Negotiations have already started so there is an additional degree of urgency attaching to this matter.<\/p> <p>  The proposals which are before the committee today are for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 1393\/2007 on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, and for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206\/2001 on co-operation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters.  I appreciate that the issues before the committee do not, at first glance, seem to be as significant as those with which it normally deals.  Nonetheless, the scrutiny of these proposals by this committee is important in its own right and is also a necessary step in facilitating the moving of the motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas, which will enable the opt-in to both measures to be exercised.  <\/p> <p>  Committee members will be familiar with the legal basis of the proposals which are before us today.  That legal basis is to be found in Title V of Part 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, otherwise known as the Lisbon treaty.  The application of Title V to Ireland is subject to the provisions of Protocol 21, which provides that Ireland shall not take part in the adoption and application by the Council of proposed measures under Title V, unless it notifies its wish to do so in accordance with Article 3 of the protocol, within three months of the proposal being presented to the Council.  Under the same protocol, Ireland may at any time after the adoption of a measure by the Council under Title V notify the Council and the Commission, in accordance with Article 4 of the protocol, that it wishes to accept that measure.  <\/p> <p>  Article 4a of the same protocol provides that the opt-in provisions of the protocol also apply to any measure, proposed or adopted under Title V, which amends an Act into which Ireland has already opted.  That provision of the protocol is of particular significance where the measures which are before the committee today are concerned.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the service of documents, there have been two previous proposals on this matter, in both of which Ireland has participated from the outset.  The current proposal builds upon the previous proposals in an organic way, and non-participation at this time could be misunderstood both by the Commission and by our EU partners.  The service of documents is a critical element in a range of EU instruments operating within the civil justice space, and the view may be taken that our participation in the amended service instrument is essential for the effective functioning of those instruments.  In this regard it should be borne in mind that Article 4a of the protocol contemplates the possibility that, if non-participation by the UK or Ireland in an amended version of an existing measure makes the application of that measure inoperable for the member states or the Union, the existing measure shall no longer be binding upon or applicable to the UK or to Ireland, as appropriate.  <\/p> <p>  Where the taking of evidence proposal is concerned, Ireland has participated in the 2001 regulation on the taking of evidence from the outset.  The efficiency of judicial procedures in civil or commercial matters requires that the transmission and execution of requests for the performance of taking of evidence should be made directly and by the most rapid means possible between member states&rsquo; courts using modern digital technology.  For similar reasons to the service of documents proposal, continued participation in the evidence regulation and its proposed amendment is considered to be highly desirable.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the proposals themselves, as I said already, they provide for amendments to existing regulations in the area of service of documents and the taking of evidence.  In both cases the existing regulations apply to civil and commercial matters in cross-border cases.  I propose to deal first with the proposal for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 1393\/2007 on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.  The existing service of documents regulation provides for fast-track channels and uniform procedures for transmitting documents from one member state to another, for the purposes of service in the latter.  The regulation includes certain minimum standards on the protection of the rights of defence, including providing that papers to be served on a party must be written in, or accompanied by a translation into, either a language which the addressee understands, or the official language of the member state addressed.  Uniform legal conditions are already in place for serving a document by post directly across borders.  <\/p> <p>  The European Commission has conducted a review of the operation of the 2007 regulation and while it concluded in broad terms that its application and operation was satisfactory, it also took the view that the passage of time, developments in respect of other regulations and advances in information and communications technology gave rise to a need to propose amendments to it.  The aim of the amending proposal is to streamline and modernise the arrangements for service of documents between member states, thus making them more effective and efficient.  The proposal clarifies that the regulation applies in all situations where the addressee is resident in another member state, with the aim of ending the current questionable practice in some member states of serving documents in that same member state on parties in another member state by what are referred to as alternative or fictitious methods of service of documents.<\/p> <p>  As part of the modernisation process the amending proposal envisages utilising, where possible, modern information and communications technology rather than existing paper-based systems.  It is proposed that communication and exchange of documents between sending and receiving authorities would be carried out electronically, through a decentralised IT system made up of national IT systems interconnected by a secure and reliable communications infrastructure. <\/p> <p>  Another element of the amending proposal is for member states to assist in locating a person on whom a document is to be served.  The proposal offers three alternative options, from which each member state must provide at least one in its territory for persons asserting their rights from other member states.  Those three options include provision of judicial assistance through authorities designated by the member states.  Also included is the provision of access to public domicile registers through the e-justice portal, or provision of detailed information via the e-justice portal on available tools for locating persons in their territories.<\/p> <p>  Further new provisions are those which concern electronic service of documents, where it is proposed that such electronic service would be an additional alternative method of service under the regulation, and treated as the equivalent of service by post.  In addition, the existing provision concerning the rights of the addressee to refuse service of a document in certain circumstances is strengthened and clarified in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice.  Finally, the current provisions concerning the giving of a judgment in default of appearance are updated.   <\/p> <p>  I will turn to the proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206\/2001 on co-operation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters.  The existing 2001 taking of evidence regulation provides for the taking of evidence in a member state other than the one in which judicial proceedings are or can be brought.  This is an important instrument for European judicial co-operation given that it is often crucial to present sufficient evidence to the court to prove a claim.  The regulation establishes an EU-wide system for the direct and rapid transmission of requests for the taking of evidence between courts and lays down precise rules as to the form and content of such requests.  The efficiency of judicial procedures in civil or commercial matters requires that the transmission and execution of requests for the performance of taking of evidence is made directly and by the most rapid means possible between the courts of the member states.<\/p> <p>  The regulation provides for two methods of taking of evidence; first, the taking of evidence by the requested court following a request transmitted directly from the requesting court to the requested court; and second, the direct taking of evidence by the requesting court.<\/p> <p>  The initiative to amend the 2001 taking of evidence regulation is closely linked to the initiative concerning the service of documents regulation which I have just outlined.  In 2017, the European Commission conducted an evaluation to assess the operation of the existing regulation.  It has been acknowledged that overall the regulation has made a contribution to achieving objectives and has improved the efficiency of legal proceedings.  It increases mutual trust between courts and helps to reduce the burden for citizens and businesses engaged in cross-border proceedings.  However, according to the evaluation report, contacts between the bodies designated by the regulation are still almost exclusively paper-based, with adverse impacts on cost and effectiveness.  Also, video-conferencing is rarely used to hear persons in another member state.  <\/p> <p>  The aim of the amending proposal is to improve the smooth functioning of the area of freedom, security and justice, and of the Internal Market, by increasing the efficiency and speed of the cross-border taking of evidence.  It proposes to achieve this by adapting Regulation (EC) No. 1206\/2001 to technical developments, exploiting the advantages of digitalisation and ensuring that more use is made of video-conferencing.  It is hoped that the initiative will increase legal certainty and thereby help to avoid delays and undue costs for citizens, businesses and public administrations and address shortcomings in the protection of parties&rsquo; procedural rights.  <\/p> <p>  I will now outline the principal amendments proposed to be made to the taking of evidence regulation No. 1206\/2001.  It is proposed to replace Article 6 of the regulation dealing with the transmission of requests and other communications.  This amendment introduces the mandatory electronic transmission of requests and communications through a decentralised IT system composed of national IT systems interconnected by a communications infrastructure.  It is proposed to amend Article 17 and to insert a new Article 17a in order to ensure more frequent and faster use of direct taking of evidence in accordance with Article 17 via video-conference where this available to the courts in question.  It is proposed to insert a new Article 17b to facilitate the taking of evidence by diplomatic officers or consular agents.  This relates to the taking of evidence, in another member state, by hearing nationals of the member state which they represent.<\/p><p>It is proposed to insert the new Article 18(a) to ensure that digital evidence taken in accordance with the law of the member state where it was taken is not rejected as evidence in another member state solely due to its digital nature.<\/p><p> Overall, the proposal to amend the regulations seeks to address the need for modernisation, in particular digitalisation and the use of modern technology, in the cross-border taking of evidence.  These changes are expected to generate benefits for citizens and businesses involved in cross-border proceedings.  <\/p><p> Negotiations on both proposals which we are examining today commenced on 4 October.  Ireland has, in the past, taken a positive approach to participation in the various civil law instruments which have been presented and our approach on this occasion is in keeping with past practice.  It is important that we honour the commitment given in the context of successive treaties that we will take part in relevant measures in the justice area to the maximum extent possible and early opt-in does not necessarily mean that all elements of the Commission's proposals are acceptable to us.  It will, however, strengthen our hand in terms of any policy stance which we may take, whether alone or in consultation with other member states.  That policy stance will be influenced by appropriate consultation with interested parties including relevant Government Departments and the Courts Service.  It is important that Ireland is seen to be in a position to play a full part in these negotiations and a positive response to the motions which have been tabled will facilitate that objective.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for making the time available to deal with these matters today.  I look forward to the comments of the committee members and am happy to address any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#D00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":821,"content":"<p>The Minister of State might like to take a breath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#E00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":822,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is skilled in delivering such a detailed paper and he did so well.

As has been mentioned, I head up the operational support department and am based at the PSNI headquarters in Belfast.  I have had senior responsibility for the delivery of local policing for more than 12 years as the operational district commander for Newry, Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon and as the chief superintendent and assistant chief constable for local policing across Northern Ireland.  I am also the national lead in the UK for police contact management and am a director of the Police ICT Company in London.  I have had the privilege of working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for many years, including with the gentlemen to my right in particular but also the rest of the senior team, on cross-Border investigations, cross-Border operations and cross-Border major event planning.  I am a graduate of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na executive development programme, which is run by the Garda with the UCS Smurfit School, and I am the co-author of the cross-Border strategies involving the Garda, PSNI and the respective justice Departments, North and South.<\/p> <p>  Since early 2018, I have been involved in a PSNI review of local policing across Northern Ireland.  This review became necessary because our society, crime and, accordingly, how we delivered policing were changing.  While crime in Northern Ireland has reduced significantly over the past ten years, we know from experience that the complexity and type of work faced by policing has become more challenging, for example, the changing nature of public protection work.  The increasing vulnerability in society is also having an impact on policing.  The PSNI regularly deals with approximately 150 calls for service each day linked to a person with identified mental health issues or a related vulnerability.  The growth of cyber-enabled crime has impacted on policing significantly, as has the emergence of more diverse communities and an ageing population.  In addition to these changing and growing demands, we have a reducing police budget and fewer police officers and police staff.<\/p> <p>  These impacts are felt right across policing and, indeed, our partners.  I would, however, contend that the greatest impacts are likely to be felt in local policing, where there is something of a triple impact.  The first impact is that, in organisations where resources are under pressure, local policing as a resource-intensive area will be required to make savings or reduce numbers as part of that effort.  This may be accompanied by the consolidation or centralisation of some functions or resources to achieve economies of scale.<\/p> <p>  The second impact is that, with the increasing complexity in demand, more specialist skills and roles are being deployed within policing to meet them.  This increase in specialism in public protection, cybercrime and interagency working, to name but a few areas, inevitably serves to draw further resources away from local policing.<\/p> <p>  The third impact is that, with increasing demands and reducing resources, the amount of reactive service provision required to be delivered through local officers and its increasing complexity are putting added pressure on the ability to do proactive and preventative work in local communities and fulfil the associated community engagement roles.<\/p> <p>  These issues are reflected in recent UK reports published on the matter.  The National Effectiveness Review 2016 of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Services on the functions of neighbourhood policing teams, the College of Policing's modernising neighbourhood policing guidelines published this year and the Police Foundation's report, The Future of Neighbourhood Policing, which was also published in 2018, all point to these stresses and strains.<\/p> <p>  While the choices being made have a sound basis in threat, risk and harm and in policing and keeping people safe, the inevitable reduction in the visibility of local police, perhaps combined with local station closures, has an impact on public confidence in policing and satisfaction in local services, which were previously based on visibility, accessibility and familiarity.  It can also be argued that some of these impacts are felt more in rural communities, including cross-Border ones.  In recognition of this, the PSNI has had for some years a rural crime lead who oversees the PSNI's rural crime strategy and the related delivery by us and our partners.  This sits alongside relationships and practices established under the original cross-Border policing strategy and that the refreshed cross-Border policing strategy seeks to further develop under a specific strand of work, that being, policing with the community in rural areas.  This work entails continuing to build on existing practical co-operation to develop a joint Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na-Police Service of Northern Ireland crime prevention strategy for the Border region, which will assist the joint Garda-PSNI tasking and co-ordination group.<\/p> <p>  Funding for policing is a political choice.  There are pressures and challenges, but there are also opportunities and answers.  Policing and service delivery will need to change and choices will have to be made.  Communities and other stakeholders need to be part of that discussion and the decision on what that will look like.  There are opportunities that, if properly considered and well delivered, can continue to keep people safe and build confidence in policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":833,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Todd for his opening address.

As the people who deal with the victims of rural crime, especially burglaries, every day, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acutely conscious of the impact this crime has on people, families and communities, both urban and rural, and in particular vulnerable victims.  Burglary is not just an economic crime.  It is one that can have a devastating impact on people emotionally and personally.  That is why we are so determined to tackle it.<\/p> <p>  In November 2015, the Garda introduced Operation Thor, with which the members are familiar.  It was a new approach with a large number of units across a wide range of different areas and disciplines working together to prevent and detect burglaries based on analysis of crime trends and intelligence to target criminal gangs and repeat offenders.  It saw us denying criminal gangs the use of the motorway network and increasing patrolling in areas worst affected by burglaries.  It has resulted in many of those involved in burglary being arrested and charged.  Since November 2015, more than 8,300 arrests have been made, more than 9,500 charges have been preferred, 34,000 searches and 203,771 patrols have been undertaken, and 143,231 checkpoints have been mounted.  In addition, we have heavily publicised locally and nationally crime prevention advice through our \"Lock Up and Light Up\" campaign.  All of this activity has seen residential burglaries reduce by 34% and non-residential burglaries down 23% since November 2015.<\/p> <p>  We have maintained that focus in 2018.  This year up to the end of August, residential burglaries are down 17% on the same period last year.  However, we will not be complacent, particularly when we are coming to the time of the year when burglaries traditionally increase due to the longer winter nights.  We also know that, while we have significantly reduced burglaries, this is no comfort to those who are burglary victims or are in fear of being a victim, particularly elderly people living in isolated areas.  In this regard, the winter phase of Operation Thor has started.<\/p><p>There will be increased patrolling and more checkpoints with a particular focus on criminal gangs and repeat offenders.  The assistant commissioner for special crime operations is meeting all the detective superintendents from across the country tomorrow to reinforce this message.  <\/p><p> I ask members of the public to lock up and light up, particularly in the evenings.  During the winter, nearly 40% of burglaries happen between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m.  Burglars are most likely to enter homes through the rear door or a window.  I ask members of the public to use timer switches to make their homes look occupied, lock their doors and windows and not to keep large amounts of cash in the home.  We also ask people to mark their property so that when we recover it, and we recover a large amount of property each year, we can return it to them.  It is vital that people report crimes.  We can only investigate crimes reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and each and every crime is investigated.<\/p><p> Thefts from farms have fallen nationally by 8% in the past year, but again we are not being complacent.  We fully recognise the terrible impact theft from farms can have on the livelihoods of farmers and their families and their sense of security.  We are continuing to work with local communities, community groups and farming bodies to reduce farm theft.  For example, this was a major focus for the Garda during the recent ploughing championships.  We advise members of the farming community to restrict access to their yards, lock gates when not in use and ensure their property is well lit as more farm thefts occur at night than during the day.  Farmers should also ensure that machinery, tools and vehicles are secured properly and details such as serial numbers and property markings are recorded and photographed.<\/p><p> In the context of community policing, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is dedicated to policing with the consent and support of the community.  We have a strong connection with the community we serve and maintaining and enhancing that bond is one of our key priorities.  We recognise, however, that we need to change in this area.  Society is changing at a rapid pace and we have to keep up.  Society is demanding a more responsive service and we will meet that demand.  With the numbers of garda&iacute; starting to increase, we can put in place measures to deliver a policing service that is better positioned to address the concerns of local communities.  We will ensure community policing is the ethos of policing in Ireland.<\/p><p> As identified by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, like many police services around the world, has struggled to put in place structures and practices that support a truly community orientated police service.  The commission acknowledged the work done and innovation shown by many excellent garda&iacute; in this area but found that their implementation of community policing lacked specific direction.  International research has shown that changing this requires more than just a technical fix.  It needs restructuring, decentralisation of decision making, greater empowerment of front-line officers and, most critically, having an external focus where we regularly and actively listen and react to the needs of the community.  It requires that all our personnel have a strong community orientation.<\/p><p> As the Garda Commissioner has said, the Commission on the Future of Policing provides the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a pathway in this area and other areas to improve our service in conjunction with our policing partners.  In this regard, following extensive research we are developing a new model of community policing based on delivering localised policing services to meet the differing needs of different communities.  It will result in our systems and structures being reorganised with the aim of having a real and deep understanding of other communities and what citizens require from a modern police service.  It will reinforce that communities and their needs are at the heart of the organisation.  The division will co-ordinate all community issues and develop tailored policing responses to communities based on their needs.  This approach will be part of the new proof of concept divisional policing model that we will introduce in four divisions, namely, Galway, Mayo, Cork city and Kevin Street, in the first quarter of 2019.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a public service and must provide a quality service that meets the needs of the public.  That is the focus of our approach to community policing and policing in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":836,"content":"<p>I thank Assistant Commissioner Leahy.

Is that a useful use of resources or do members of the public need to recognise that one cannot have vast numbers of garda&iacute; on the street all of the time?

It is pretty much the same picture across the United Kingdom.  This debate on the visibility of local policing has been going back and forth since I joined the police service and that was not yesterday.  I can remember a chief constable in Bristol saying 25 years ago there will be no more cops on the beat and coming under significant political fire for making that statement.  That debate has continued until now in the way the Deputy outlined it.<\/p> <p>  Local communities take a significant degree of reassurance from seeing their local police.  I spoke earlier about visibility as well as accessibility and familiarity, in other words, people see the police, can make contact with them when they want to and they knows who they are.  This means people feel linked and engaged with the police.  The significant reassurance that comes from that should not be underestimated.  Similarly, we talk about police stations and the very fact that bricks and mortar provide confidence for local communities because they have a police station.  If a police station is closed or moved, it is generally a source of significant local stress.  All of those things have a value for the community.<\/p> <p>  In light of changing demands and the complexity of the circumstances we face, it is difficult to put one's finger on the cash value of having police officers on patrol providing reassurance.  Then we get into the debate as to whether we know the cost of everything but the value of nothing.  The honest answer to this question lies betwixt and between the cost and the value.  Most emerging models try to bridge that space by having local based teams which are also responsible for a substantial amount of service delivery.  Depending on how this approach is modelled, it can work very well because every time a crime or an incident is reported, it presents an opportunity for the local team to engage and be involved in problem solving and building of solutions around that.  If one puts too much into that aspect, the teams do not get to engage in policing and instead become response teams engaged in what amounts to fire-fighting, which is a pejorative term in these circumstances.  Everybody draws a line and strikes a balance in a different place but finding the right balance is one of the tricks in designing a model.  The stress has been there for many years and no one professes to have the wisdom to solve this issue.<\/p> <p>  On ways to do this differently and sometimes better, the PSNI now has a social media outreach with more than 900,000 followers.  In most towns in Northern Ireland more people follow the PSNI on social media platforms than ever meet a police officer.  We need to be clever about how we use this platform and publicise it daily.  For example, we can show people that while they were at work, we were patrolling their area, making arrests or recovering property.  This is a way of showing the value of the police work that takes place through the use of social media channels and outreach.  It provides visibility in a wider sense, rather than only seeing officers in uniforms on the streets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":839,"content":"<p>Does the PSNI know every day what percentage of its officers are out on the ground?

Another issue is capital costs and whether it is worth spending capital on maintaining buildings that are not in use.  If we put officers into buildings, they are not on the street, which takes us back to the issue of visibility.  People like the thought of having a local police station but in a fixed resource pool the choice is whether to have police officers sitting in the station or out on the streets?  Having them out on the streets is effective in terms of preventing crime, detecting crime and providing reassurance to people.

I will go back to one of the questions Deputy O'Callaghan asked earlier about community policing and boots on the ground.  We have reached a watershed in terms of the report on the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I have the report before me.  The report, on page 17, states:<\/p><blockquote>There are many excellent garda&iacute; who know their communities well and perform an exemplary service, but it is clear that the community policing system as a whole is under strain.  Neither the structure of the police organisation nor its practices support the image it has of itself as a community police service.<\/blockquote> <p>That is a fairly strong statement.  Basically, it indicates that we are not structured and the practices we are engaged in reflect something other than a community policing service.  The report identifies and acknowledges the islands of innovation and the individuals who have put great work into community policing.  The commission is effectively asking us to do a complete flip in terms of how we deliver the service.  The commission is looking for a paradigm shift.  I know this because I have discussed it with members of the commission.  I have tried to get inside their heads to find out what exactly they had in mind when they were discussing this.  They are looking at something really different.  They are saying that we have to change what we do considerably and that we have to bring all instruments of the organisation into alignment with a community policing ethos.  They are looking for a paradigm shift.  One of the members of the commission stated that the commission got a clarion call from communities to the effect that this is what they want from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They want a community policing service that we can really call a community policing service.  Our structures and practices need to reflect that.  They are saying we need to change our philosophy.  If we are to call ourselves a community policing service then our activities behaviours and structures should reflect that.  Really, what we are looking at is something altogether different.  Internationally, there is a language of community policing that exists but when we start to dismantle it, much of it amounts to tinkering at the edges while the traditional model remains at the core of policing.  The commission is asking us to change that substantially.<br\/><br\/>I will set out what we are bringing to the table.  The framework we are developing at the moment is attempting to address this but it will come with significant challenges.  Changing the orientation of policing and changing the philosophy towards a community orientation have not really been achieved anywhere.  Generally speaking, police forces have add-ons and we have all seen that in operation for years.  For example, there may be a handful of really good people and some great initiatives.  We have great initiatives throughout the country but the commission is saying there is no national structured approach to community policing.  It is almost an add-on to the traditional model.  We are being asked to do something significant and it would be important to go through that with the committee at some stage.  We need to tease out how we perceive this and what it will look like.  We may need a presentation on that at some stage.  We are being asked to engage in a paradigm shift and it is important to get that message out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I am pleased to hear that because community policing is sometimes a motherhood-and-apple-pie concept: everyone is in favour of it but no one really knows what it is.  Sometimes it can be vague.  It is important to imbed it so that people can know exactly what community policing is.  Then, when resources get undermined and reduced, it can stay there and remain unaffected by the vagaries of the Garda budget.  Is that the objective of the new model of community policing the Garda is working on at present?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#H00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":849,"content":"<p>That is the framework on which we are working.  It will represent a complete restructuring of what we have in place.  The idea is that we will have a national structure and that we will be able to know from a national position down who owns every area in the country in terms of community policing.  The idea is that, as the national lead in this area, I know who the community garda is in west Kerry or Cahersiveen and that we can communicate directly.  The idea is that the people in these locations know who their community garda is as well.  We are aiming to achieve a situation whereby everyone will know who their community garda is.  Although everyone on the commission says that all of those at district level will be community garda&iacute;, there has to be a graduated level of community orientation.  This is because detectives are detectives and while they need a community policing ethos, they have to be skilled in other areas too.<\/p> <p>  We maintain that the entire front line will be geared towards community policing.  Training, recruitment, promotion and so on &ndash; these are all instruments - need to be aligned to show that is the case.  This is a real orientation towards community.  We have to take a complete outside-in perspective.  We will have to put in place the technology and some sort of customer relationship management system to connect us completely with the community.  The idea is that we are in constant communication with them and that we are logging and tracking all the issues that arise.  These are non-emergency issues but we need a full problem-solving approach to policing.  The idea is that someone owns it and is responsible and accountable for it at street level, team level and as part of a national structure.  That is what we are being asked to do and that is what we are working on.<\/p> <p>  We had a draft ready for some time and we were moving in this direction but, in light of the commission report, there was no point in moving on it.  Using the census data and a satellite mapping tool we mapped out the entire country.  Every division in the county has been mapped out down to a Central Statistics Office level.  We have all the data captured.  Many areas have been mapped out to what we term community policing area level.

It is interesting for us from several points of view.  The similarities North and South are interesting, as are some of the differences.  Perhaps we could explore the whole area of co-operation along Border communities, especially given the onset of Brexit and so forth.  What level of engagement has been embarked on in terms of rural crime?<\/p> <p>  I am struck by a particular matter.  We are sick of the lads being before the committee.  We have them in all the time and we are well used to them but it is an extra privilege to have Mr. Todd before us in order that we might learn from his experience.  We often look to the PSNI model post-Patten.  We say it was instrumental in shaking up the culture that existed previously.  One point made by Mr. Todd is striking.  He said that the level of evaluation and analysis has continued into the evolving role of a police service.  We are a little behind in the South perhaps but we have begun that process.  It has been added to a little by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland but we are still a little behind the PSNI.<\/p> <p>  This may be a little eclectic but several points stand out for me.  One emerged last week on foot of the presentations we received.  It relates to the service changing from a more traditional role in crime, targeting, arrest and detection into being far broader in scope.  Mr. Todd referred to 150 calls each day linked to mental health issues.  That would have emerged in a project we did on the Prison Service and the number of people who are incarcerated now who traditionally would have been in psychiatric institutions.  The criminal justice system has become a hoover for many social problems.  How does the PSNI deal with that?  What is the interface?  I imagine it is a question of the interface between the PSNI and other organisations.  In the South, it has certainly been something of a problem in engaging with the likes of Tusla, the HSE and others organisations.  How does the PSNI deal with the connection with other state agencies that deal with health and mental health?  Mr. Todd referred to specialist services and the requirement for more specialist skills to deal with those areas.<\/p><p>How does the PSNI deal with the emphasis away from crime and detection to being something much broader?  We have identified in the South as well, but the PSNI may have been dealing with it a bit longer.  The numbers in the Police Service of Northern Ireland have greatly reduced.  Obviously there were security elements in that, following the Good Friday Agreement and all of that.  The PSNI seems to have managed quite well with lower numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#H00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":854,"content":"<p>If I miss any pieces, the Deputy will bring me back because there is quite a bit in that.  I will deal with the partnership aspect first.  I am not being humorous in this.  When communities say that they never see the police I could quip that if one pops into accident and emergency departments one will generally find them there.  That is really indicative of the crossover between healthcare and criminal justice issues, and the number of people coming into the criminal justice system because of missed opportunities, service gaps or whatever the causation is on the health or education side of the equation.<\/p> <p>  That has been increasing.  In 2007 and 2008 when the security situation was improving markedly, a previous visitor to this committee from the PSNI, Sir Hugh Orde, introduced armed response units as a tentative step towards a routinely unarmed service in an improving situation.  I was a commander at the time.  It was a significant drain on my resources to establish that new resource.  I had some reticence and scepticism about the wisdom of that choice.  I am now in charge of those units as part of my portfolio.  While they are really busy, they are not busy doing the task for which they were configured.  Armed response units were introduced to deal with gun crime, knife crime and people who are dangerous committing crime.  They still do that and do so very professionally.<\/p> <p>  However, more than half their business is now generally in interventions with people self-harming and harming others because of mental health issues.  They have a high level of training and provide a high level of non-lethal intervention in situations that might otherwise get out of control for police officers.  This was something we never did or were never skilled, trained or equipped for.  Ten years on those units are flat-out busy every day of every week at every point on the clock.  It is more than an anecdote; a lot of data sits behind that.  That is just the societal shift with which policing deals.<\/p> <p>  Custody areas have been a revolving door for us.  We see familiar faces in custody - the same people.  When we sit down and talk to those providing healthcare we find they fall into two categories.  They are either frequent attenders at accident and emergency departments and other medical services or they are not on the health service's radar at all but actually have significant health needs.  That is a healthcare and equality issue.<\/p> <p>  We have just put staff into the custody suite for the proof of concept two weeks ago having spent two years working on this.  It is moving from just having the standard forensic medical officer, police doctor, in the custody suite who might confirm that person is fine and is fit for interview, to a nurse-led healthcare arrangement in custody suites.  We are trying to identify why this person is consistently coming in to us; what the healthcare gaps are; and how we can signpost them to healthcare interventions so that they are not rocking up to accident and emergency departments when it gets out of control and they are not getting arrested and brought to the custody suite.  We are trying to break that vicious cycle through a criminal justice and health partnership.  That has been co-funded by the Northern Ireland Departments of Justice and Health.  It has been put into action with 17 new nurses recruited as part of that package from 1 October now completing their training under medical supervision.<\/p> <p>  We are also in conversation with the ambulance service not only in Northern Ireland, but across the UK.  There is co-dependency between ambulance attendants and police attendants at calls.  Frequently the ambulance service is looking for police support to calls because of the nature of what it is dealing with.  Frequently we are getting there and dealing with ambulance calls because the ambulance service is stretched doing other things as well.  Some services and forces in the rest of the United Kingdom are looking at embedding paramedics in police control rooms, and police officers in paramedic control rooms.  It leads us to the question of why we do not just slice the bread before we put it into the bag, and have joint police and ambulance control rooms.  That has been explored in key areas, such is the crossover and co-dependency in this area of work.  That goes back to the changing nature of society and the changing nature of policing that I mentioned in my opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  There are good experiences and good things happening as we explore that way forward in the wider UK.  There has been less traction in Northern Ireland.  I point to the lack of a statutory compulsion to do that.  The work we are doing with our partners at the moment is done on the basis of getting a coalition of the willing to find a solution for these things and that has been useful.  In England and Wales - there is a similar but different situation in Scotland - there is the statutory crime and disorder partnership, which compels statutory agencies to work together to deliver key outcomes for communities and society.  There are particular problem areas.  Scotland uses single-outcome agreements where the parties and the various statutory agencies sign up to deliver their part of the outcome and their contribution to it.  That is a statutory requirement.  That is the same in England and Wales.<\/p> <p>  We attempted to get similar legislation introduced in Northern Ireland in 2011 and 2012.  It fell for reasons which are not important today.  From talking to those in political parties across the spectrum in Northern Ireland I know they recognise we need it.  Particularly at a time of austerity where all parties are under pressure, for politicians and Government to get reassurance that we are doing everything we can in partnership will take some statutory compulsion because it does not happen organically in my experience - certainly not in the way that it needs to give the Government reassurance on behalf of communities and society that we are doing the best we can with it.<\/p> <p>  That looks to the changing nature of partnership dependencies and what we might do differently in future.  I have quoted some of the examples in there.  I am happy to expand on that.  I think that has touched most of what the Deputy has asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":855,"content":"<p>It is incredibly interesting - mind-blowing in some ways.  The committee could definitely consider recommending statutory compulsion.  I have two related questions.  Is the experience similar in the South?  The scale of that issue strongly emphasises the point we dealt with previously regarding treating drugs as a health issue rather than just a crime issue and the interface there.  In reports that have been done in the South in the areas of the review around children being taken into care by garda&iacute; under section 29, the experience was that the garda who dealt with that issue was generally very professional, caring and empathetic.  However, the gap arose in their subsequent interconnection with the other social services and agencies.  Given the training garda&iacute; get, how could we expect a garda to have to deal with that stuff?  If we are talking about moving the police service in that direction, which is happening anyway, where is the specialist training for dealing with all that stuff that really requires medical expertise?  Would the figures in the South be as dramatic as in the North?  What specialist and interagency approach applies there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#J00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I absolutely agree that is a factor of policing now.  We are all dealing with that at the moment.  The level of mental health issues and trauma we are dealing with in the people with whom we engage is becoming really topical.  It was not part of discourse in policing five or ten years ago but it is very much part of it now.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, appeared before the committee earlier.  Members will be aware that he launched the evaluation of the joint agency response to crime, JARC, in recent weeks.  That has been very successful.  It brings An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the Prison service and other agencies together focusing on a certain cohort of criminal activity and the people who are involved in it.  That is all about trying to engineer them out of the criminal justice system and bringing about interventions that would not normally have been available to the police.<\/p> <p>  The central protective services bureau has been operational for quite a while and the divisional model is bringing on the other ones.  They will be in all divisions before too long.  All of that acknowledges that we are not just dealing with criminals; people have a background.  The majority of people who end up in prisons have suffered trauma in childhood and we have never been part of a discourse on that.  However, that is changing substantially now.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of one of those outreach programmes in Dublin city at the moment between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Ana Liffey Drug Project, Dublin City Council and others, where they are going out and looking for these hard to reach people who are not being provided with the full intervention spectrum to address their issues because drugs, homelessness and trauma are all wrapped up in the same individual.<\/p><p>They are going out and finding people in laneways and doorways.  They are trying to create a relationship with them to find out what interventions are being made for them.  Where gaps are found, they try to fast-track them into treatment and through the housing system which, as members are aware, is very difficult.  That has been ongoing for quite a while.  I believe there are 50 people in the city who are part of the programme.  Yes, it is becoming very much part of the lexicon in policing.<\/p><p> I shall give the committee a flavour of the training provided or acquired for community police officers which based on the model that is in place.  Every garda who is encountered on the street, certainly those in uniform, should have received this training as we move into the future.  It starts with ethos, ethics and human rights, decision-making, problem identification, problem solving and vulnerable and trauma impact identification.  This is a new discourse and dialogue in policing.  The training also includes harm prevention, intervention strategies, multi-ethnicity collaboration, victim support, stakeholder analysis and engagement, data management, diversity and integration, hate crime and community roles and responsibilities.  There is also community interaction with minorities and migrants, age positive actions and mental and physical health.  There is a list of aspects that need to be engineered into the police training programme.  This is included in the framework we are presenting to the Garda Commissioner.  It has been acknowledged that it is part and parcel of policing.  The discourse on it has really only come to the fore in the last couple of years.  It is also absolutely reflective of what Mr. Todd is describing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":858,"content":"<p>If the assistant commissioner wants to come back in at any time, he should please just take the initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#K00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I share what has been said.

It is really a case of what someone does with the medium and adds value.  It is a cultural challenge and has been for us.  Pretty much every local neighbourhood team has more followers on social media than the numbers who buy the local newspaper.  That is a fact.  People are more likely, therefore, to get their news and information from a policing perspective through social media than through their local newspaper.  Local newspapers have been trending off, while we have been trending upwards.  That is generally the case in any town across Northern Ireland; there are more people who read our social media feeds than the local newspaper.  To make it work, social media are very much in the moment, relevant and sometimes can be a little edgy.  That is the cultural challenge, something on which we are still working.  The local garda or police officer in the town has to be able to access a social media device and post about stuff that is happening in the area, without centralised control.  That does bring risks.  I do not need to tell politicians about what happens when one gets it wrong on social media.  It is no different for those involved in policing.  You have to trust your people and allow them to do it, accept that they are going to make mistakes from time to time and that you are going to have to apologise when they do.  That is the only way to make it fast, interesting and engaging.  Otherwise there will be all of the people who follow the organisation but do not really engage with it.  While we conduct national campaigns from the centre through our feeds, most of the interaction locally is about day-to-day stuff such as a lost dog, a missing person, a stolen car or a broken window, with the local team and local people engaging in real time.  This is decentralising.  Sir Hugh Orde would have said his model and ethos to enable community policing was maximum devolvement of authority within a corporate framework.  We keep revisiting the corporate framework, but we have never, ever, moved away from empowering local people to do things locally.  Social media make this even more important.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to station closures.  When I was asked about how we took the partnership forward, I spoke about the statutory framework.  In the past 12 to 18 months we have been working with significant success on a concern hub.  It started in Derry-Londonderry.  It is a local multi-agency hub to where the police and partners can take individuals of concern, high demand or high need users, whichever way they come to attention, and people sit around the table and ask: \"How do we fix this?\"  One then realises that while the police has eight pieces of information on the individual, the education people have three pieces, the housing people have four and the health people another five.  When all of the information is put in the one place, solutions start to appear.  We now have five hubs running.  We have not gone right across the province because currently we are reviewing policing, but I believe we should be actively considering what the structure should look like at a local level.  If we are to have local policing, local service delivery and local problem solving, we need a local partnership structure through which they can be delivered.  It needs to be empowered by the partner agencies.  Experience shows that this is effective and usually cost efficient.  We have anecdotal examples from the centres that show that people who used to contact the agencies around 50 or 60 times a year about a range of issues are now finding that their problems have been solved and that they do not have to contact us anymore.  There is a return on investment in that type of approach.  <\/p> <p>  I see the relevance of this approach to the conversation.  As Assistant Commissioner Leahy said, we need to find a way.  If we can devolve authority to that level and our authority as a collective to partnerships and have a local partnership management structure, in which the police will provide a service for every element and do the policing piece in collaboration with partners around the table, it will be much more resource effective and an effective way to do business.  That is the challenge, not only in our own structures but also in how we dovetail  them to make them work collaboratively and in unison with other partners.  The community could then feed its needs into that space.  The accountability structures can be local.  We have police and community safety partnerships that oversee and hold local commanders accountable for performance or other partners that are involved.  It needs to expand into the service delivery space.  We have partnership service delivery and decision-making at the centre of the organisation - as an enabler - to devolve decision-making to that level.  In the first instance, in the Patten report, the ethos within our corporate framework was maximum devolvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":869,"content":"<p>That is some really good information.

That figure is between 3.9 and 8.5 in more rural areas.  The difference is significant.  I do not want rural dwellers to be sitting back in fear of crime to a greater extent than they should be.

Some very good ideas have been set out.  They are quite different.  How has dealing with the abuse of animals in rural areas been elevated?  Many people in the community take this issue very seriously.  There is probably a perception that our law is not sufficiently severe in how it deals with people who abuse and mistreat animals.  Maybe there is not enough awareness of this issue, certainly in the South.  It is not treated with enough importance for the Garda to deal with it properly.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  What has been the experience of the PSNI?<\/p> <p>  The other matter I would like to raise is at the other end of the spectrum.  The issue of hate crimes has been touched on.  New communities and minority groups are a huge part of the new Ireland, North and South.

We are improving and communication is taking place.  Perhaps it is the case that we do not deal with these issues until they surface.  I know from some of the exchanges we have had that communications has been a problem in the past.  I think we are enhancing it and getting the message out to our own people that we need to take it seriously.  We need to work with the other agencies.  It is only when we work in that way that we can get really successful outcomes.  We are working closely with various organisations across the country, including the ISPCA.  It is important that such relationships are fostered because they are the key to achieving successful outcomes.  Regardless of whether the social problems we are dealing with involve human beings or animals, my perspective is that the most effective way of achieving success is to work with agencies.  I am not sure whether Mr. Todd has had any difficulties in this area.  I know from my time working in the northern region that there are many cross-Border issues, for example involving cattle smuggling.  I found that there was a great relationship between the PSNI and the Garda as they sought to make sure investigations were carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#L01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Finn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":889,"content":"<p>We have been criticised for the degree of priority we afford to animal cruelty offences.<\/p><p>It is not on any of the local policing plans as a core policing priority, but it matters to local communities so, when it surfaces, we work with animal protection agencies and other agencies.

Sometimes that plays out in hate incidents and hate crimes, properties being attacked and people being harassed, abused and insulted.  That pops up on a number of different fronts.  My colleague, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, is a UK leader on hate crime.  We think the PSNI is proficient at that but the solutions lie locally.  The strategies and plans can be in place and support can be brought, but it has to be done through local policing solutions.  It is transient in nature.  There are different communities in different places at different times because of employment factors and factories and food production.  With freedom of movement, people move to places where there are opportunities.  As is the case in the South, what once were new communities are now mainstream and those people are starting to put down roots as second or third generations in the schools.  There are schools in Northern Ireland that would be closed but for the kids from new communities.<\/p> <p>  That is reflected in the police service.

That is understandable but it does not make it any easier for people like me and my colleagues to plan for it.<\/p> <p>  It would be fair to summarise what the PSNI has done to date as looking at the range of cross-Border work it currently does and has done over recent times, looking at which of those pieces of work rely on European instruments, legislation or regulations, and trying to work out, if those were lost, how to maintain the current position.  European arrest warrants allow us to bring people from North to South and South to North for offences.  That is well practised and routine.  What would be the position if there were no European arrest warrants?<\/p> <p>  Information sharing is the lifeblood of North-South, UK-wide and Europe-wide operations.  That information sharing, across a range of disciplines, is lifeblood to many policing operations.  Which parts of that and which access to those systems requires European regulation, and what would be needed if we did not have them?  The PSNI is taking account of all those and telling the Department of Justice and other partners that those are where the gaps will be and those need to be filled.  That forms the basis for that plan.<\/p> <p>  There are things that we have control over, like meetings, face-to-face exchanges, secondments from North to South and South to North, the building and maintaining of relationships across the Border, and the joint task force on organised crime.

Shortcomings of ours relating to the incident were identified and we have accepted the report and recommendations.  However, we are a little uncomfortable that that was the third police interaction with the individual over a three-day period.  On the first occasion, police took the individual off the street and to hospital for medical care.  The person was released, again encountered by the police and taken back to hospital for further medical care but was again released.  The person then tragically took his own life.  Our follow-up in that incident was not good.  However, operational officers would say that if the system worked better, such things would not happen.  Our frustration does not stem from being criticised but, rather, that in spite of our best efforts and interventions and taking the person to a place of care, he ultimately took his own life.

Child sex exploitation may also form a part of some of those situations and must be dealt with.  That illustrates the complexity of policing.<\/p> <p>  As I stated in my opening, an investigation used to involve a police officer meeting the person, taking notes, speaking to a few other people and writing a report but now involves seizing CCTV and examining mobile devices.  It takes six times longer to conduct a proper investigation than it used to and requires far more skill and technology.  That is the nature and complexity of our business.  Missing persons and other matters have added to the volume of work with which we must deal.<\/p> <p>  Contact management is the shop window of local policing.

It highlights how incredibly challenging all of this is.  In terms of the local partnership structure, a major issue for PSNI members is the job of working positively with the community.  Assistant Chief Constable Todd mentioned service gaps several times.  Children are falling through the cracks because of service gaps and children and some adults find it hard reach a good space because of them.  We are highly conscious of that in the South also.  For example, in County Wexford mental health services are only open for those who need to access them between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., from Monday to Friday.  It must be a nightmare providing for those who need those services outside those core hours.  If that falls on the plate of the Garda or the police force, as it does much of the time, surely there must be a greater need for the education of policing personnel to deal with these very complex and difficult areas.  Is Assistant Chief Constable Todd satisfied that the education of his members is of a sufficient standard to manage these difficult challenges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#O01000","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":925,"content":"<p>I believe training always struggles to keep up with the changing demand.  There is a nervousness in policing, and perhaps in other agencies also, about training our people to fill a space that is not ours to fill.  That is where the partnership conversation comes in to play.<\/p> <p>  Police forces, not only the force in Northern Ireland but also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all the other organisations with which I have worked, are can-do organisations.  If one gives them a problem, they will fix it.  That is in our DNA.  It means that when these problems are thrown at us after 4 p.m. on a Friday through to 10 a.m. on Monday, we will do our level best and apply ourselves to the job of keeping people safe and doing all those things one would expect the police to do.  If we continue to train our people in that space, it will be at the cost of something else.  That is a conversation for the partnerships and the communities on the role of policing and the way it is intended to address this issue as we go forward.  More gaps will develop and the police force can no longer be expected to assume responsibility for managing this space.<\/p> <p>  There will be core things we need to do, and these have changed over time.  Members receive much more training in suicide awareness and suicide intervention and negotiation and problem solving.  That has changed over time as well.  There is much more nuanced use of policing powers in problem solving.  We need the partnership structure to come together in a co-ordinated and collaborative way to bring solutions, rather than having us continue to train more of a declining number of officers using a smaller budget to do things that it is not part of our role to deliver in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  We need to have a training needs analysis to identify the things that police officers can reasonably be expected to do, as part of their core policing role on a day-to-day basis.  There are then specialist roles on top of that.  The road becomes never-ending once we accept that we will be the emergency service of last resort.  To illustrate this point, a national recommendation was made to me, as the UK national lead for contact management, that we train all police call handlers in the UK in first aid because a call handler in a police centre, in an attempt to do the right thing, gave poor first aid advice to a person who suffered additional injury as a result of that advice.  The recommendation was to train every contact management operative and call handler in the UK in first aid.  That is the role of the ambulance service.  It is a question of training our members to recognise what is needed and transfer the call.  If we try to train all officer in everything, we will never succeed.  Rather than managing risk, as we may believe, we will probably create risk because we are taking money and resources from somewhere else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I get the point.

We refined that in 2013-14 to a figure of 7,000.  As of today, in terms of full-time equivalents, we have just shy of 6,600 members.  By any stretch, we are below the number required.  That has not been driven by our choice but by the political choice to reduce funding for policing.  Our police staff side has been reduced as well.  Those involved in police staff roles perform a large number of support roles in contact management centres, forensic science, human resources departments, finance departments and all the other roles that make an organisation work and without which we could not function.<\/p><p>We have reduced those across the board.  One can see the stress in the system.  Over the past three years, we have gone from 84 neighbourhood policing teams to 34.  We have targeted those teams in areas of high deprivation.  That relates to the conversation we had earlier about engagement and making sure that those people do not fall into the clutches of paramilitarism in those areas.  Going from 84 to 34 was a big cut in neighbourhood policing teams.  We moved some of those functions into local policing teams, but that model is not sustainable with our current numbers because we keep taking numbers out of it for all the reasons I outlined and it has that triple impact on local policing.  The model is creaking and that is why it is not working.  Some of that is down to numbers.

In every station we closed, we did a fine analysis over time of the members of the public who were using the police station.  On some days, it was none at all and on a busy day, it was three or four.  Things like that were generally not core functions and could easily be done on the phone, online or through some other way of offering that service.

The Deputy is referring to section 12, where a garda is empowered to act if a child is at risk.  He is right that Dr. Shannon, when he came in, said that garda&iacute; acted very professionally in this role.  Much of that came from on-the-job training and experience that people picked up along the way from other members.  With regard to full-on training, garda&iacute; would have been trained on the Act itself and understanding what it meant, but with regard getting into the mindset and going in to do an evaluation in a home situation to determine whether a person is at risk, much of that over the years has been based on a member&rsquo;s perceptions and what he or she feels, sees and picks up in the environment he or she is in.  Dr. Shannon found that we applied that very well and in a very sensitive way.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Todd is right that for every issue or incident that arises for policing there is a call for additional training.  The spectrum is jammed full at the moment, both here and, as Mr. Todd describes, in the North.  The bottom line is that for everything one trains for, something else falls off the far side, as it were.  One can only take on so many of the roles that other agencies are more experienced at.  Mr. Todd is right when he says that when we get into that space, we start creating a risk for ourselves and for others in many cases.  We are changing the nature of the game in policing ourselves, and as I went through the list of training for community garda&iacute; and what they will be exposed to, they are taking training on trauma, mental health and such areas that would not have been on the floor, so to speak, for policing.  It would have been a traditional approach to policing.  The environment has changed quite considerably for us and training will change accordingly.<\/p> <p>  Going back to how it should be addressed, the joint agency response to crime is the way forward.  Mr. Todd hinted at it with regard to the PSNI, where we are operating with other agencies that have the capacity and expertise to deliver services that we cannot instead of training police to do it.  When we talk about the joint agency response to crime, we are talking about having appropriate agencies working together to provide unified, integrated services to people whom it is not appropriate for police to service on their own.  That will require some significant changes because the Deputy is right that, in certain circumstances, some agencies work from Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and I have worked at the coalface in and around Pearse Street and Store Street for many years, as a sergeant, inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent, where people present themselves at all hours of the day and night over the weekends.  We try to operate the out-of-hours system and we have children and young people looking for a place to stay, but it ends up at a garda's front door.  We need to move out of that system when addressing that type of issue.  This is a constant situation for policing across Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK in general.  We are all dealing with the same issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":940,"content":"<p>Mr. Todd said that funding for policing is a political choice, which is a very strong statement.

Given that we have closed so many of the stations in the south, do the witnesses think they can do that as well as they would like with the current resources?

One of the difficulties we all experienced in the past when the numbers dropped was that in order to provide 24-7 cover in the main centres, we sucked garda&iacute; in from the outside stations to backfill.

Given that the numbers are coming back up due to the increase in Garda personnel, we now have an opportunity to put garda&iacute; back into communities and leave them there to focus on engaging with people and dealing with local issues.  It was not a mistake because we had no option at the time but to bring in garda&iacute; to keep patrol cars going on a 24-7 basis.  Now we have that option and that is what we are looking at in terms of the new policing model.  We can start to backfill positions in those communities and those involved will become the local community garda&iacute; in Deputy Wallace's area and in other areas.  That is what communities want.  They want to know the local garda and to know he is there to help them solve local problems.  From my experience, that is the type of presence a lot of communities in rural areas want.  That is the reason they were most critical of us in the past when we sucked the resources into the main urban centres.  Even if a station remained, it was not open because there was no garda there to open it as he or she was in the local town driving a patrol car and providing a service in the bigger area.  We have an opportunity to deal with the issue now and that will be part of our philosophy going forward in terms of getting our resources back up.

They will be the orchestrators of community policing in the sense that every division and district in the country will be broken down and mapped so that somebody owns every segment of it.  In a rural area a person may be required to have a bicycle or a car and additional resources are required for that, but he or she will own a particular area as an individual and will be held accountable and responsible for that, but people will also be part of a broader team for a wider area.  We can call it a sector or whatever else is agreed.  Every part of the country should be covered by the community policing initiative.  People will know who their community garda is, but he or she will be part of a team so even if he or she has a day off, somebody on the team will pick up the slack.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace referred to resources.  In a rural area where the community policing area could be 25 sq. km, a vehicle will be required and we will include that in the cost of introducing a community policing model that has a proper structure and that the practices we employ are effective.  That is an example of some of the structures that will be put in place and potentially relates to the 80% of non-crime issues we normally deal with.  It is not emergency response but relates to problem solving in communities and it must happen day in and day out.  It is not a question of having days of action, it is a constant approach to engaging with communities, determining what the needs are and developing unique responses to them.<\/p> <p>  The concept of community has changed considerably in the past two or three decades and people are operating almost like customers.  People come together as a community but they also come separately.  One has to get beyond the broad brushstroke of community and have a unique response to the customer base that is out there, for example, Mrs. Leahy and Mrs. Murphy who have a very different requirement to the group.  It is not an easy task but I am prepared to come back to the committee at some stage and go into the challenges associated with community policing and give an indication of how it has been implemented elsewhere, what failures have been encountered, and the challenges presented.  It changes the nature of the game for policing.  Generally, we all operate to a traditional command-and-control response system.  Despite the fact that we have had real successes with community policing, we have not had a national model.  In 2015, we were given an award for European best practice in community policing.  We were also nominated that years as one of three areas in Europe for the European public sector excellence award in community policing.  We have an understanding and knowledge of how to introduce community policing in a microcosm but it is a challenge to do it on a national scale where one delivers a consistent approach to delivering a community-oriented policing service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":946,"content":"<p>To the best of my knowledge, approximately 65% of the prison population have mental health issues.

Some of what is helping keep the representation up is that the people retiring are disproportionately from the Protestant community.  Therefore, when there is better representation recruited and a high number of people from the Protestant community retiring, the balance of the organisation tends to stay where it has been.  Ideally we would like to see in a straw poll that 45% of all our new student officers are from the Roman Catholic community, but because we have not reached that and the long-term trend may come under pressure, that is a strategic concern.  There is work going on to see if we can address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":951,"content":"<p>Would it be true to say that the communities in the North are still segregated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#R00400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":952,"content":"<p>For sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":953,"content":"<p>In Belfast, for example, there are Catholic areas and Protestant areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#R00600","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":954,"content":"<p>That persists, particularly in the urban environment.

We do not make any distinction between the background of officers and the areas they police except where there is a concern in a town they come from.

To that extent there is.<\/p> <p>  Apart from the prison service, to respond to Assistant Commissioner Leahy's point and the Deputy's last question, that joining up of services and agencies was probably best done at a senior strategic and central level.  The challenge for the work on community policing is how to make those joined-up services available to local practitioners and cops.  The waiting time for referral for heroin addiction in Belfast can be 18 to 20 weeks.  Sometimes it goes beyond that, depending on the waiting lists in the health service.  If there is a police officer in a town dealing with an individual who is breaking into houses or cars or stealing from shops to feed their addiction, society's solution should at least include some treatment to remove the causative factor in heroin addiction from that person.  If the person has to wait 20 weeks for treatment and the system does not work, they end up in the custody suite, court and prison, which goes back to the Deputy's earlier point.  When the local police officer dealing with the problem, using all the skills we have given him or her, identifies the problem, the culprit and a potential solution which requires partnership, how does that police officer use that local knowledge to get a response as opposed to a document signed off between departments headquartered some distance from the officer working on the ground?  When I talk about local partnership delivery systems, that is where it has to be joined up.  The prison service has a role to play in that, perhaps not a major one but that is a challenge.  Communities are telling the cops what the problems are.  We know what the underlying problems are and the long-term solutions, but then what?  If we cannot get the long-term solution, we end up arresting the culprits, processing them, putting them before the courts and locking them up.

I apologise that I had to step out for a moment but the parts of the meeting I was here for made for a very interesting discussion.  The first issue I wanted to picked up on is local accountability mechanisms.  It is an element of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I will first direct some questions on structures in place in the North to Assistant Chief Constable Todd.  I understand the policing and community safety partnerships, PCSPs, are more advanced and robust than the joint policing committees, JPCs, in the South.  Will Assistant Chief Constable Todd give us a general sense of what a typical PCSP meeting involves?  What are the general functions of these partnerships and how effective are they?  How much community buy-in exists in the different communities?<\/p> <p>  I also have questions for the two lads from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In terms of the JPCs and the policing fora, it is not immediately clear to me from the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland's report what the division of labour between the two will be in future.  In my experience, the community fora are much more effective and there is much more community interest in them.  The JPCs can often amount to information sessions for members of local authorities.  That is the responsibility of local authority members and Oireachtas Members too as they often do no more than ask questions.  Nonetheless, there is more meaty engagement and, if is not quite the case that more formal decisions are taken, there is at least more general agreement to action things at the policing fora.  There seems to be more of a focus on that in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland but I am not entirely clear on what a JPC should do as of now.  I would welcome observations from the representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on how either of these two accountability mechanisms could be strengthened. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#S00700","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":972,"content":"<p>Post the Patten commission, the original structures were called district policing partnerships.  There was one district policing partnership in each of the policing districts, which are coterminous with the council areas in Northern Ireland.  Local authority areas are coterminous with policing and district policing partnerships in order to maintain accountability.  That role changed over time.  A number of partners and functions were merged, through the councils, into policing and community safety partnerships but the ethos remains the same.  It is a slight play on language.  They sit under the auspices and governance of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which is analogous to the Policing Authority here.  They are managed, supported and funded through that structure.  While the policing board holds the Chief Constable accountable for the performance of the police service, the language around policing and community safety partnerships is that they monitor local performance but there is actually an accountability framework, or at least we treat it that way, which errs on the side of more rather than less accountability.<\/p> <p>  Typically the meetings would begin with the local police commander and some of his or her team providing an update on performance against the local policing plan.  Having a local policing plan which sits under the umbrella of the Northern Ireland Policing Board's policing plan for Northern Ireland is another function of the policing and community safety partnership.  That is designed to give that body, in dialogue with the local commander, a say in the policing priorities for the local district within a wider framework over the next year.  The commanders use those meetings to report back on how they are performing against that plan, on what is working and on what is not working, and on anything that has changed in the meantime. <\/p> <p>  There is then a general discussion forum for any other policing issues of the day.  That might include signal crimes, incidents, developing trends and that sort of thing.  As the Deputy might imagine given this morning's conversation, that conversation often wanders off into determinations that certain issues will be a matter for the council or one or other department.  Very few problems have one answer from one place.  That experience is probably foremost in my mind when I see what the likely future for that structure is.  I think we should retain that local planning because legislation in the North has introduced the concept of community planning.  The local councils are involved in community plans, of which policing and policing plans are aspects.  However, if one takes community planning, local accountability and partnership working, that seems to be a rich space for a true police and community safety partnership on which all the relevant agencies would sit and take a holistic view of the problems in the area and how they can be influenced holistically by local service delivery.<\/p><p>That is where it has to go to.  That is the current structure and its current format.  The important parts from my perspective is that it has helped to change the culture down through the years.  Accountability has gone from being viewed as a novel idea to being part of the air that one breathes.  Accountability is a complete non-contentious matter and it is what one expects to do as a local commander.  As a commander, in the districts I have run I use the cultural change opportunity to take my local sergeants down to those meetings.  If we are truly into local neighbourhood policing, run by the local team, under the local sergeant, then who better to hear what the public is saying and to respond in terms of what the police are doing one the ground, without any filtering by the senior manager such as me, than the local sergeant and local inspector on those teams?  I used that process quite deliberately to try to build that relationship.  We talk about maximum devolvement of decision making.  I believe in devolving the accountability as well.  I actually believe the local TD, MLA, MP or local representative should be able to ring up the local sergeant.  If they ring me, I will only ring the sergeant anyway and give him or her my version of what I heard on the phone.  The local relationship is germane to local policing, local understanding and local relationship building.  That is what we have done, almost as a collateral benefit to that structure.  That is a bit like social media, letting go the control and letting that happen at that level.  As a senior manager, I am acting as an enabler and putting a wrap around to it, so that one gets flagged on critical issues with which the local team needs support or what is happening in the area.  <\/p><p> Accountability works on a number of levels.  There is more we could do with it, as I have outlined further this morning.  That is my rationale behind it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":974,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Todd.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#T00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":975,"content":"<p>In the context of the structure of the joint policing committee, JPC, versus the local community fora, what Mr. Todd has said echoes my experience on the ground.

There was accountability in that system because the garda&iacute; had to come back the following week and were asked about the particular problem which the community had put on the table that needed to be resolved.  The local fora gave a much better service to the community at local level in terms of solving the problems.  I would certainly love to have more agencies involved.

If one is meeting once a quarter as a member of forum, a great deal of water has gone under the bridge in between meetings.  What we are proposing in terms of community policing structure, and we have experienced this, is that it be dynamic; then there are no surprises when one goes to the JPC because one has dealt with it all full on.  The Garda management knows what is going on, the local representatives know what is going on and the local authority knows what is happening because they are working on it day in and day out; the actual committee becomes a committee.  When I was posted to the north inner city and was involved in a JPC I never felt that I was being held accountable any more; as a committee it was our responsibility to deal with the issues and that was the way we approached it, but that came about because we were not lining up a list of issues at a quarterly meeting.

If there are to be two structures, the joint policing committee, JPC and the community fora, there is a need for more definition of what are their respective functions.  There could be an element of replication or the JPC could become a formal box ticking exercise.  That is not necessarily just the responsibility of the Garda; it is also the responsibility of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the legislation and what follows from it.<\/p> <p>  A major element of the model of community policing that existed in this jurisdiction has been the designated community garda.  The number of designated community garda&iacute; has fallen substantially, in the order of 37% since 2010.  It has fallen further in some districts, for example the fall in the number of community garda&iacute; in Donegal and in some of the Dublin districts was particularly large.  The decrease in numbers in other areas was not quite as dramatic.  The proposal in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is that every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be a community garda.  I maintain an open mind but I would have some reservations.  My concern would be that yes, every garda should be community focused and orientated and conscious of the needs of the community and being responsive to it, but if one does not have a dedicated community garda whose primary focus and responsibility is developing relationships with the community, instead of 10% of the Garda whose primary responsibility is to community policing one will have 100% of the Garda for whom 10% of their responsibility is community policing.  If every garda is a community garda, when there is a spike in crime in a particular area or a public order issue, or at the time of year when there are lots of events, do members of the Garda get moved off that intensive community policing work into fire-fighting whatever particular issues arise at a moment in time?  Dr. Johnny Connolly from the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was before the committee last week and he said that where the community policing model worked well, people knew who their local community garda was and he or she was the person they knew to seek out in the station, or the person to contact about the community bus or other useful information.<\/p> <p>  From the perspective of Northern Ireland and the South, do the witnesses have a view on the model that every police officer or garda is responsible or that there is a need for dedicated community garda&iacute;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#T00700","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":980,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised a really interesting point.  Unfortunately when one determines that everybody in the district is a community garda, that has been the greatest escape hatch for the traditional model since policing began where everybody is a community garda but nobody is.<\/p><p>That is not what the commission had in mind.  I engaged with members of the commission before this meeting, including Johnny Connolly, and I have had discussions to try to find out what exactly they had in mind.  They come out in the commission report and say there is a stratified set of qualities and skills required, and that these will differ.  While they highlight that, the Deputy is right, however, that we need to know what the dedicated community garda actually is.  The first responders will have a different skill set but they must have a community policing ethos, so there is a certain level of training they must undergo.  Similarly, detectives in drugs units must all be indoctrinated into the ethos of being community-centric.  A certain skill set is required for that foundation community policing cohort.<\/p><p> We are suggesting that a community garda is determined to be such if he or she is spending 60% or more of his or her time dedicated to community policing.  We all know that, for a major protest or major event, it is all shoulders to the wheel in policing.  That is the nature of the game.  It is what the public would expect and what we ourselves expect.  This is the definition we are proposing, namely, they would spend 60% or more of their time dedicated to problem-solving in the community and they would be associated with a particular well-defined area so that everyone in the area would know this was the community garda and that this was the person to call when in trouble.<\/p><p> To manage a situation like that nationally or even on a district basis, there must be a hub and someone must the conductor of all of this.  That is why we are suggesting there will be a divisional community policing office that manages all of the data around this and tasks, for example, Pat Leahy, the community garda on the ground, because Mrs. Murphy is saying she has an issue.  She is now Pat Leahy's constituent, and he is responsible for minding that person and making sure the problem is solved.  If the garda needs to leverage resources to come in and assist, such as a detective unit, a drugs unit or a traffic unit, the system should facilitate that very effectively.<\/p><p> That is probably what is most appropriate in this respect.  It is a concept that has created a conversation around this because it has in the past presented the escape hatch for policing to say they are there already and no change is required.  I can be categorical, from talking to members of the commission, that that is not what they have in mind.  They have a paradigm shift in mind in that we need to go back to the drawing board and reconstitute our approach to community policing.  They are unambiguous and very strong about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":982,"content":"<p>Would the Assistant Chief Constable like to offer an additional view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#U00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":983,"content":"<p>I am very much in the same place.

I agree with Assistant Commissioner Leahy that it is about the mindset, ethos and skills.  That is the way our policing in the community project has approached this, namely, through cross-cutting values and skills and approaches across the business area.  If one needs to get the community focus at the front end of operations, the specialists work through the local neighbourhood sergeant and local neighbourhood team.  The community impact assessment and the advice from the local sergeant tailors what that operation ends up looking like because everyone understands they are there to solve problems on behalf of the community, and they do not want to create problems by not being thoughtful or not being consultative and collaborative around it.  Those are the working practices that come out of this.<\/p> <p>  I would say our detectives and specialist units that support the local police in those operations have a community policing mindset and an understanding of this area.  They have almost a second nature and they understand why they are there, working through local cops as opposed to just being a specialist unit that arrives in town for the day and disappears tomorrow.  That is the shift that is required in order that everyone will have that mindset and ethos.  When we talk about the national decision-making model in the UK, people will take us round the various steps of it but what they often forget is that sitting in the middle of the model and the touchstone for each element of it are values and community policing behaviours.  That is the piece we rely on so we get that piece across the organisation.

The following are my words and not those of the witnesses, but it seems to me that I am picking up a certain level of frustration with some of the other agencies and the fact they could perhaps be doing more, and certainly that there are gaps outside of policing that need to be rectified.  I am curious as to what more needs to be done outside of policing.  Are there services that need to provide more of a 24 hour service?  I am thinking in particular of the social services and Tusla.

I would like to see the concern hubs become that on a daily basis for the partnerships, whereby the partners are tasking what is required in response to the needs of the community, and the police would just feed into that as a service delivery structure.  At the moment, while the concern hubs and partnership hubs have staff from the agencies, they are only meeting formally once a week or once a fortnight.  I would like to see that being much more dynamic, driving the daily business much more, and actually coming together as a partnership.

With other stakeholders, we run the Late Night Leagues every year.  In 2018, 1,763 kids were involved.  The games generally take place on a Friday night at times when kids are most likely to be out and about getting themselves into bother.  In 2017, 2,100 kids were involved.<\/p> <p>  I will take the committee through the list of initiatives under way across the country.  While they do not all engage with kids, some do.  I have stripped some out, leaving 174 individual initiatives that engage with and are embedded in communities.  I could have included three or four times that number.  Great efforts are being made, but engaging with young people of that age is a major challenge for us.  They are beginning to have thought processes of their own and making their own decisions.  I do not mean to be facetious, but it was Mark Twain who said that, when he was in his teens, he thought his father knew nothing about anything but that, once he had hit his mid-20s, he was surprised by how much his father had learned in such a short time.  We are dealing with that cohort of people and it is difficult.<\/p> <p>  The diversion programme run by the Garda has a major success rate.  We include young people involved in criminal activities in the diversion programme and get them through it.  A large number never reoffend or come back into the programme.  It is another aspect.  Unfortunately, it comes after we have encountered them in criminal justice scenarios.  Considerable efforts are being put into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#W00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I will make just a couple of points on my own behalf.  Mr. Todd's response to the inquiry about Brexit echoed almost verbatim what I received last week from the executive director of Europol.  I am part of the 28-member joint policing scrutiny group across the European Union.  I put the question to the new executive director, Ms Catherine De Bolle.  I listened carefully to Mr. Todd and thought to myself that his reply was almost exactly the same.  Even on the bigger stage, the situation is no different than from what it is on our own small island.<\/p> <p>  I am a Border Deputy and also a proud Ulster man.  Cross-Border crime presents in a number of ways.  It does not affect the agricultural community only.  I commend the PSNI.  In recent days I noted that there had been a significant retrieval of stolen goods north of the Border that the news reports indicated had all been stolen south of the Border.  It is not something on which Mr. Todd can comment because it is probably in the judicial realm, but it is indicative of the level of cross-Border co-operation and the good work being done on the ground.  In that regard, I should also commend Mr. Todd's colleagues in the Garda.<\/p> <p>  I noticed in the statistics Mr. Leahy cited that there had been a considerable reduction in the level of rustling.  It was once a significant issue, certainly in Cavan-Monaghan.  While it did not all make its way north of the Border, there was a strong sense or suspicion and a suggestion in public discourse that it did.<\/p> <p>  All of these issues are of great concern within the Border region.  We can only take solace from the fact that we will see an increase in community policing south of the Border as a result of the significantly improved throughput at the Garda College in Templemore.  We will unquestionably receive our share.  On the situation north of the Border, is Mr. Todd anticipating an intensified recruitment drive?  Is it something that is in the offing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#W00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>No.  In the absence of the Executive, we are in the unfortunate position of having to work with a year-by-year budget.  Normally the PSNI would plan on the basis of a three to five-year strategic budget.  For three or four years there has been a year-by-year settlement, sometimes even after the financial year has begun and which generally involves less than what we had in the previous year in real terms.  There is no prospect of a substantial uplift in police officer numbers.  In fact, the pressure is always downwards.  Depending on what Brexit and policing requirements look like, there will be questions about whether there is a need for resources.  While the questions have been asked, no promises have been given.  In the short term, it is a reasonable proposition to seek to increase the level of student officer recruitment as a contingency measure in the context of what Brexit might look like, but such is the attrition rate in the organisation owing to the number of officers retiring that, if we were to stop recruiting, we would come straight back to the numbers we now have and it would not serve to increase the size of the organisation significantly.<\/p><p>The short answer is \"No\", but there is a wider context to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I would hope that Brexit is not the prompt that results in additional resourcing; I hope it is for other, better reasons in terms of everything else we have discussed today.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the assembly and Mr. Todd's reference earlier to statutory compulsion, my colleagues have picked up on that and it is very important and useful information.  As Chairman of the committee, and in view of the various hats I wear, I hope that the assembly and Executive will be back up and running as quickly as possible, not only for the sake of this matter - whatever the reasons it could not be embraced North of the Border as it has been in England and Wales with perhaps a slightly different arrangement in Scotland - but also in terms of all the other matters that are not being addressed.  I know all colleagues here share my view.<\/p> <p>  It was indicated that a number of the statistics are down.  From what I noted from what was put on the record, that is a consequence of good policing work in terms of prevention.  Burglaries and all of that are down - reference was made to Operation Thor - because of preventative work.  That is most important and I congratulate the Garda on all of it.  However, I wonder what has happened in respect of detection statistics.  Perhaps the witnesses do not have the figures with them but they might like to comment on that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#X00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>I will certainly comment on it, although the Chairman is right that I do not have the figures with me.  So many changes have taken place in the crime counting rules and various other aspects.  The committee would certainly need an analyst to describe and explain what has happened in respect of the statistics.  There are anomalies in statistics for detections, for sure.  Across policing generally, it is an area about which we need to be really careful.<\/p> <p>  There are perverse outcomes that come from chasing detections and we have seen that in the past across the globe.  For example, if I send out 50 additional garda&iacute; in Dublin city centre on Friday and Saturday night next, the public order figures will shoot up because I will have more people to engage earlier with public order incidents.  That does not mean public order is any worse.  Equally, if I say there is no overtime this weekend and nobody is working on public order, the figures will drop and it will look really good.  We need to look into and beyond the statistics.  There are questions to be asked.  I am only giving an example showing how the statistics can change without it meaning that the situation has changed.  In respect of sexual assaults, we are doing everything we can to make it easier for people to report in that space.  That is what we want.  However, that is going to affect both the numbers and the detection rates.  We are trying to achieve one outcome but we are being hammered because we are achieving it.  There really is a deep understanding required in respect of detection and reporting rates.  The committee would need to dedicate a day to the subject on its own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>I might share some of the knowledge here.  I have to claim responsibility for some of it due to some work I was doing on improving the quality of our data across the organisation. One of the initiatives we brought in was in respect of how we claim detections.  When somebody was apprehended in the past, we would have claimed detection earlier on.  Now we have changed it in the interests of improving our data, so that it is not until someone is summonsed to court that the detection is claimed.  This year, our detections dropped because of that lag.  It is only when the cases come to court now that a detection will be claimed.  That has impacted on our detection statistics for the first half of this year.  It will probably be March of next year, when we will have had 12 months of the new statistics, that we will see it beginning to level out and come back to normal.  Right now, there is a dip in the detection rate caused by that anomaly for which I have to take some responsibility.  Yesterday, I met officials from the Central Statistics Office and they are quite happy.  The office knows what we are doing and why.  It is all part of our initiative to improve the quality of data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":1019,"content":"<p>Next week, the committee will be meeting representatives of the Irish Farmers Association and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association.
