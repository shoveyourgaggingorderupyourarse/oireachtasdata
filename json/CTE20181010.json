It was a timely reminder of the seriousness of the problem of cervical cancer and that one of the tasks arising was to try to ensure it would become an increasingly rare event in the next decade or two.  We will I hope not see such deaths again in our lifetimes.  There is the possibility that cervical cancer will be turned into an extremely rare disease.  I am saddened by the deaths of the two women.<\/p> <p>  It was a great honour to undertake this piece of work and a great privilege to meet many of the women affected and talk to them in person, on the telephone and at meetings, as well as to talk to the relatives of those who had passed on.  I took great encouragement from their help and support and what they told me, often in frank terms, about their illness and experiences which I have done my best to fully reflect in the report.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the joint committee and the Oireachtas for taking so long to deliver my report.  My terms of reference were specific about when it should have been delivered and I failed in that regard.  I hope I did not fail in too many respects, but I fully admit that I failed in that regard, for which I apologise.  As the committee will understand, the delay was caused by the extremely poor provision of information in response to our queries and requests for information.  It took a long time to get the information.  Certainly, it was still appearing within a week or ten days of finalisation of the report.  However, I am pleased to say we received all of the information we had requested, without redactions.  We had interesting discussions about it and are unaware of any document that was withheld that we should have seen.  I am satisfied that we had an adequate opportunity to go through the information with which we had been provided.  I apologise again for taking so long.<\/p> <p>  I also apologise for not completing the job.  Late in the day, thanks to the efforts of Dr. Denton and others, through our inquiries, we discovered that there were serious issues arising about the laboratories to which the slides of Irish women had been sent.  By the end of the inquiry we were unable to complete our inquiries into that and other matters pertaining to the contracts and the process of tendering.  We suggested there was further work we could do in the near future and the Minister has so agreed.  I hope we will finish work on these important matters satisfactorily within a short time.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked three questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am sorry for jumping in ahead of Dr. Scally.

Screening programmes are the health service asking people, on behalf of the State, to come forward.  This places increased responsibility on the health service to ensure the programmes are well run and organised.  That applies across the screening agenda, whether it be for colonic cancer,  breast cancer or cervical cancer.  Screening programmes are different in that way.  They are also different in that there is a balance to be struck between benefit and disbenefit in screening.  Breast screening is a good example because the active screening process exposes and has exposed some women to small levels of radiation which irradiate them.  That was certainly the case pre-digital mammography.  The benefit is that cancers will be detected early.  The benefit outweighs the disbenefit in a well run and well organised screening programme.  It it exactly the same with cervical screening.  A well run cervical screening programme should prevent up to 75% of cervical cancers or detect them at an early enough stage to allow effective treatment.<\/p> <p>  Along the way there is the issue of what happens when the screening slides do not reveal the cancer or the pre-cancerous changes.  That could occur for three reasons.<\/p><p>Even though the woman has an abnormality, no cells may be present in the slide, so the finding will be that the cells are normal and there is no problem.  Alternatively, cells may be present but the persons who are reading the slide, which are generally dealt with by more than one cyto-screener, may not spot an abnormality.  That may be for one or two reasons.  It may not be very distinct or it may be a matter of judgment and their judgment is that there is nothing significant.  Alternatively, it could be a very plain error where there are sufficient signs of abnormality but the person misses it.<\/p><p> I think a mechanism should be put in place to compensate a person due to an error which has potentially serious consequences.  It should be done in such a way as to avoid adversarial proceedings and there should be a system in place to cover, I would argue, all the screening programmes, and immunisation should be dealt with in that way.  In the UK, there is a system in place for immunisation where the Government has dispersed a very sizeable sum of money in compensation to a very small number of people who may be adversely affected by immunisation.  That is in recognition of the fact that immunisation happens for the benefit of everyone but some people have, for whatever reason, an extreme reaction where that has resulted in disability to a certain level and there is an expert view that it cannot be ruled out that it was caused by immunisation, and so compensation may be awarded.  A similar scheme would be appropriate in the case of screening.  We ask people to come to us to have testing done.  If they are failed by that through genuine error, there should be a mechanism to deal with that.  I hope that Mr. Justice Charles Meenan will consider that but it is outside the remit of our report.<\/p><p> With regard to open disclosure, if one goes back to the review of slides and the way it was conducted, it was initially conceived of as an educational process for the laboratories.  When CervicalCheck knew about cases of cervical cancer, remembering that it did not know about all cases, it sent a notification to the laboratories involved and those laboratories generally reviewed the slides.  In some cases, particularly those we are interested in, they had an alternative reading of that slide which indicated that there were changes visible that would have indicated a change in treatment.  The process was not designed to generate information to go back to CervicalCheck in particular.  It was meant for use by the laboratories themselves, for their own educational purposes about the performance of the laboratory and its staff.  Although a copy of the report came back, those were not aggregated or passed on to anyone.  There was a decision to put those in a structured and ordered fashion and gather that information.<\/p><p> That decision came about at a time when the Health Service Executive implemented its open disclosure policy.  A member of staff heard about it entirely fortuitously because that member of staff had been working in a hospital and still received some emails from that hospital, then received an email with an invitation to a meeting about open disclosure.  This person came back to CervicalCheck and said there was a new thing called open disclosure and that it needed to take it into account in what it was doing.  That is how open disclosure started to happen within CervicalCheck.  We know it was not done at all well.  As I made abundantly clear in the report, I find the open disclosure policy and guidelines that were in operation seriously deficient.  They were not so much open disclosure guidelines as a policy where clinicians were encouraged to disclose if they wanted to.  The guidelines gave them every chance of not disclosing and made it really easy for them not to disclose.  It was not really open disclosure at all.  That is why my recommendations are very plain and simple about open disclosure, particularly that there should be a statutory requirement for disclosure.<\/p><p> On the commission of inquiry, as the Chair correctly pointed out, it was not one of my recommendations, though it was my view.  My view is that we were fortunate enough, partly because of the increased timespan that we had, to be able to deal with a substantial number of the issues in substantial depth.  I was very cognisant of the view that had been expressed to me by quite a few of the women and relatives, that a major concern was to make sure that the screening service was fit and safe for their daughters and nieces in the future.  Such was the range of deficiencies that I identified that I made recommendations across that wide range to put the system right.  I feared that, if there was a move straightaway to a commission of inquiry, it would further delay the implementation of the recommendations and it would distract the system and the HSE in particular from getting on with doing what they should be doing.  As I said in my foreword, that was my personal view rather than a recommendation.  I would not have made it a recommendation because I would have been usurping the right of the Oireachtas to make that decision for itself and I have no business making a recommendation to the Oireachtas.  It is perfectly capable of making that decision for itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Scally.

Sorry, that was just a bit of a joke.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their work.  I was embarrassed that they felt they needed to apologise about timelines in the beginning.  Their work is excellent.  It is one of the best reports we have seen in these Houses in my time, especially one delivered in a short time.  I have many questions but will prioritise them.  Some of the questions relate to the report and I have discussed that already.  I will not go over them because the witnesses have been quite accessible.  I have questions about the future and where we need to go.<\/p> <p>  The most important thing related to the report is that the recommendations are implemented as soon as possible.  We should work from that baseline and take that as our priority.  Everything else is subsequent to that.  It should be all about protecting this generation and future generations.  That is what the women who are affected, their families and patient advocates have as a priority too.  I have spoken to them numerous times.<\/p> <p>  I want to drill into the terms of reference the witnesses were given, which are partly our fault as legislators.  There is a lot of commentary on this issue.<\/p><p>Journalists and politicians need to be careful sometimes about the language they use because language is very important here.  Sometimes there has been a use of language which was not necessarily accurate.  Dr. Scally was not asked as part of the terms of reference to go in and investigate what happened in the 221 cases, as regards the laboratories themselves.  I believe that is something we probably left out.  I am not sure if he would have been able to do that anyway from a timeline point of view, but that did not happen.  I am aware there is an ongoing review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, but let us be clear, the investigation of the laboratories and the 221 cases, or whatever the number is - I think it is slightly more - was not part of remit.<\/p><p> In particular when we outsource such work, and also when we insource, contracts are in place and reviews are built in as part of that.  There would be built-in reviews as part of these contracts using organisations such as HIQA.  When the HSE became aware of issues, why did it not drill down into what was happening and investigate each of the cases?  Why did it not happen?  Will it ever happen?  Will we ever find out what happened in each individual case?  Will we drill into the detail of each individual case as regards the people who were looking at the slides, the fact that they were misread and that the information was not brought to the attention of management?  Why did that not happen?  According to the contracts which I have looked at, there were meant to be regular inspections but they did not happen.  There were five inspections over eight years.  Issues did arise in the inspections but they were not followed up.  That was a failure.  Why did that not happen?<\/p><p> I am sorry for asking all these questions.  No inspection has been carried out since 2014.  Is that acceptable? On the errors, probably the most important finding was that the laboratories appear to be statistically in line with international norms in their findings, but how do we know that is corroborated in the 221 cases by follow-up investigations in the individual cases?  Does Dr. Scally follow what I am saying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#C00500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Dr. Scally could not get into that detail.

I think that is likely.  We must go back to the way this review was run.  It was entirely unsatisfactory in that they only looked at the cases of cervical cancer that they knew about, so they did not get a full data set, as happens with breast cancer, of all the cervical cancers from the cancer registry, which is the most complete register.  They ran an alternative register of their own and the only cases they knew about were the ones they heard about or were notified within the screening service.  That is not a good basis for a review, and it does not give one the kind of population data that would allow one to say how many cases of slides being wrongly or differently interpreted post a diagnosis of cervical cancer there were over the entire cervical cancer programmes in the country.

I tried to explain as best I could the problem of review bias.  If a very experienced cytologist is presented with a slide to look at from someone they know has got cervical cancer, he or she will spend a lot more time and attention to it and find more things than would be found by a cervical screener looking at the slide within a fixed time span within a whole batch of slides.

My comment also applies to the medical advisory committee but that was the only meeting of the lead colposcopists in the ten years of the existence of CervicalCheck.  There was an annual educational meeting for the colposcopy community but otherwise this was the only one.  Colposcopists did not feel part of CervicalCheck, even though CervicalCheck funded them via the hospitals and they often worked in clinics with CervicalCheck branding on them.  They were given no role or input into the development of the review or any of its seven iterations and they felt quite alienated from the whole organisation.  They did not like the idea that they were expected to talk to women about their results and this did not go well.  Some behaviour was terrible and this was front and centre in my report.  These attitudes have no place in medicine and it would make any doctor ashamed to hear the comments.  On the other hand, some disclosure was done well.

I absolutely welcome that.  People had the opportunity to vote for that twice in the recent past.  They did not do so but the unfortunate events we are discussing will, I hope, put a bit of focus on open disclosure.  It is regrettable that it will take legislative underpinning to make it happen but if it does, that is fair enough.  There were descriptions of a paternalistic attitude in how the women were spoken to, which takes away from much of the good work done in the health service.  I would love to be in a position to say I was wildly shocked by this attitude but, as a woman who uses the health service, I was not shocked.  Is Dr. Scally confident that we can address that situation and change it?<\/p> <p>  I remember that the decision taken to outsource services was purely political and no clinician advised that outsourcing should happen.  When the then Minister was questioned about it she said it was good value for money but nobody ever said there was a good, sound, clinical reason for it.  It was outsourced and then re-outsourced.  Dr. Scally talked about the medical advisory committee not meeting.  He expressed surprise at the level of quality assurance and said it was not in line with best international practice.  Presumably, according to best international practice the person in charge would have sight or knowledge of the slide and would know where it was.  Slides appear to have been sent to one site in the United States and then outsourced to another site.<\/p><p>Honolulu is more widely recognised as a holiday destination than a centre of excellence for medicine or laboratories.  How can Dr. Scally and members have confidence that everything was in order when the laboratory there does not apply the ISO standard which I understand to be a benchmark and we do not know how many tests were outsourced to it?  Members have asked that question on several occasions.  The first time it was put to representatives of the HSE was at a Wednesday meeting of this committee, and the impression was given that we would have the results by the following Friday and that it was simply a case of someone in the HSE pressing a button to give us the breakdown of which labs were doing what.  We still do not have that information.<\/p><p> While the average standard in the laboratories may be acceptable, some of the labs could be out of line.  We have no way of knowing whether the lab in Honolulu was out of line with what is considered international best practice or international norms.  Has Dr. Scally tried to ascertain the figures on what slides went where, who looked at them and whether there were any outliers in that regard?  We have asked for that information but, unfortunately, we have not been given it.  We want a detailed lab-by-lab breakdown which we can examine.  I am not comfortable relying on averages.  As a colleague of mine used to say, if a person has one foot in a bucket of boiling water and the other in a bucket of ice, the person&rsquo;s two feet are wrecked but, on average, the temperature is fine.  Averages do not tell us anything.  We are seeking a detailed breakdown for each lab.  Is it possible for Dr. Scally to obtain that?<\/p><p> On contract governance and the shredding of contracts after ten years, I too was quite taken by the efficiency with which that was done.  As one quite familiar with the HSE, I can state that it does not have a reputation for being hugely efficient.  However, it certainly was efficient in this aspect.  Is it possible to get copies of the contracts from the laboratories in the United States?  The contracts could be examined in regard to the re-outsourcing.  I am concerned that, while there does not appear to have been a very deep and meaningful relationship with the contracted labs in the US, there was no relationship with the labs to which the tests were subsequently outsourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#E01200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Dr. Denton will answer some of the queries on the laboratories.

One of the good things about contracting is that some of the quality standards that are demanded in Irish contracts are higher than the US standards.  For example, there is a limit on the number of slides that screeners can look at.  During her visits, Dr. Denton has been looking at the screener records to ensure they are accurate.

It appears superficially that there are differences in the rates of certain categorisations from the various laboratories.  The problem is that these differences are very difficult to interpret.  There could be perfectly legitimate reasons for them.  One of the things that makes it particularly difficult to interpret the data that CervicalCheck has collected, and is still collecting, is that it includes samples taken from colposcopies, which tend to be taken from women who are already known to have abnormal smears.  This increases the rate of abnormality significantly, which means that the proportion of the slides which come from colposcopy determines the abnormal rate for that laboratory.  Obviously, this is not satisfactory.  That is why it has been recommended that the data specification should be altered to exclude such samples.  A number of recommendations were made about improving the quality and robustness of data to allow for links with other factors which we know to have an influence on the rate of abnormality.  If all of those recommendations are implemented, they will give a CervicalCheck a toolbox for making meaningful comparisons between the laboratories.  I feel that should be a priority.  It might transpire that there are differences which require further investigation, and such investigation might or might not indicate that there is a problem.

Did it occur to front-line staff that they should go back and look at the smears that had previously been taken?  Did front-line staff raise concerns to the central management system of CervicalCheck at any stage?  Dr. Scally said earlier that there seemed to be a disconnect between front-line people and central management.  Did he conduct an examination to ascertain whether people who were involved in CervicalCheck on a front-line basis might have dropped out at an earlier stage because of their concerns about central management?  Does any documentation indicate that concerns were raised at a far earlier stage, perhaps before the audit was done?<\/p> <p>  The second question I would like to ask relates to the number of cases covered by the audit.  It was decided to do an audit.  As I understand it, the front-line staff were not aware that the audit was being done.  Why was that information kept from the people who were dealing with the patients?  It was only at a later stage that they became aware of the audit and the results of the audit.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to ask about the period of time that elapsed between smears being done and people being identified with cancer.  Were there some cases in which the all-clear was given six or 12 months earlier?  We have heard about cases in which mistakes were made in the reading of smears not once but twice.  Serious questions are raised when a patient's smear is misinterpreted on two occasions.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to raise with Dr. Scally the number of people we have in the country and the number of front-line clinicians here.  I understand there are approximately 135 consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country, even though all the reports indicate that we should have 180.  Do we have a sufficient number of people working on the front line at the moment?  If not, what would be a sufficient number, based on a comparison between the ratio in this country and the ratio in other countries?  Should we have many more people with the requisite expertise dealing with this area?  What do we need to do to get more people into this area?  I am raising this aspect of the matter in the context of the need to provide a far more comprehensive service and ensure the same errors are not made again.<\/p> <p>  The final matter I would like to raise is the educational process.  This will not give an exact result every time.  Regardless of the system that is introduced, there will be a failure in it.  I understand that cervical cancer does not identify womb cancer.  A clinician told me recently that there has been a huge increase in womb cancer in this country.  It seems that there is some connection with the increase in obesity.  I am not clear what the connection is.  There is a higher incidence of womb cancer where there is obesity.  The level of education regarding this issue has not been as comprehensive as we would need it to be.  I wonder what Dr. Scally would do to get information out there.

There is a clear breakdown in the report of what happened when the cases were being re-examined.<\/p><p>Although the bulk of the cases where a review was needed concerned cytopathology, there were also cases where there were possible failings in colposcopy or in the administrative system.  Therefore the colposcopists would have known something was going on in that regard.<\/p><p> The major problem was that their connection and engagement with CervicalCheck was very poor.  I logically expected that there would have been routine meetings.  These were very important people in the whole process of cervical screening and looking after women whose smears were abnormal.  I would have expected that there would have been regular meetings.  After all, the health service was funding those clinicians to work for CervicalCheck as part of the screening programme.  There was not that engagement with them and they certainly were not involved in the construction of the review and the audit process.

I understand there are pressures on the workforce in terms of seeing all the women in a timely fashion.  That was not specifically part of our remit.  I agree with Dr. Scally that the most important thing is that they were not engaged with the programme.  They were signed up to management meetings and they were not involved in drafting policy.

Certainly at the time of the outsourcing of the laboratory work, there was clear evidence of cytopathologists being extremely unhappy about that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the overall numbers, workforce planning was not part of our remit.  However, we made it clear in the report that there needed to be a workforce review of the cervical screening programme to ensure it was properly staffed and had proper access to the expertise it needed.  One of the most important recommendations is that there should be a national screening committee because the means of making policy decisions on the screening programmes, including issues relating to staffing, is quite unclear.  There needs to be a national screening committee with expertise and independence which can advise about the programmes, about new programmes and about any changes or modifications needed to existing programmes.  That does not exist, which is why it is one of our key recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Education is extremely important.  I take that two ways.  I draw the committee's attention to one thing I did not address in the report and perhaps should have done.  There is no requirement for training in taking samples or indeed working with women to have a successful cervical screening experience, in other words, getting a good sample and getting the consent of the woman.  Some very good training is carried out, but it is entirely voluntary.  I wonder whether that should be compulsory and that a modicum of training should be provided for all the clinicians involved in taking the samples and dealing with the women, if only to ensure they can explain properly to the woman what is happening and also in the context of the whole programme shifting quite significantly next year to the HPV testing as a primary test, which will be much more accurate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I seek clarification.

When they came forward with those symptoms they were told they had just had a normal smear, they had no need to worry, and that they should go away and come back if it did not stop.  There seems to be a failure of education there in that the staff did not understand that the test might not pick up everything and that serious symptoms should be dealt with on a serious basis irrespective of when they occur.  There was some evidence of delays in the treatment of women because of them having had a normal smear and it was regarded that it could not possibly be a serious cervical cancer issue.<\/p> <p>  Education of staff is extremely important.

It was brought home to me in the first of the meetings I had with the women in Dublin early in the process.  Two young women came to that meeting and sat down beside each other, purely by accident, and found that they knew each other, were from the same place and had been at school together.  They were both in the same boat with having cancer.  Both of them believed that they had not been told or disclosed to properly when they should have been.  They had both lost confidence in their clinicians who had been looking after them.  As they were discussing this, they discovered that they had both decided to shift to the other's clinician.

Getting a letter from the chief executive, or the same letter being sent to all those affected, really does not cut it in this regard.

I asked the question before of the HSE, when we were trying to get to where Dr. Scally got in his investigation, but it was pretty much dismissed.  There is a concern that the baseline is distorted and that the limitation on one's testing is a 30% failure rate.  The audit process has been stopped.  Let us take as an example a person who has had two false negatives such as the tragic case of the lady who is being buried today.

The figures at which we can look are not telling us about the women with cancer who are being missed.  They are telling us about the proportion of women who have abnormalities detected.  The majority will not have cancer, but there will be changes which, if left untreated, might at some point over many years develop into cancer.  It is not an absolute measure of a laboratory's ability to prevent cancer from developing, but it is a reasonable surrogate because they are data that are relatively easy to get and are current.<\/p> <p>  Much of the problem is that when there is a look-back, many of the samples in respect of which the diagnoses were altered may have been taken many years before.  Although it tells us something useful, it does not necessarily tell us how a laboratory is functioning today.  It is important to keep the two matters separate.  There is no measure of how likely it is a laboratory will miss a diagnosis that will lead to cancer in a sample reported today.  We simply cannot measure it.  As a surrogate, we look at how good they are in detecting precursor abnormalities today, which we can do.<\/p> <p>  On real-time monitoring, that is the best we can do.  The audit tells us something different, which is what it should be doing from the point of view of improving laboratory practice, namely, identifying samples where a diagnosis was missed.  It could have been difficult, as Dr. Gabriel Scally said, but could then be used to feed into training and supervision.  I would think it would be unusual for a poorly performing individual member of staff to be detected through the audit because it would be too late.  They already have been reporting for five years at that point.  Accordingly, many of the quality assurance measures at which we look are process measures such as how does one check up on members of staff, monitor their performance and detect problems in real time.  That is what one needs to do to improve the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karin Denton"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>One of the major concerns is the audit of the two-to-one cases; the language used included misreading and obvious cancer cells on the slides.

We included the outcomes from that, which have been published, in the report.

There was no need for them to apologise for any perceived delays at all because it was far better for them to do the job thoroughly, given its importance.  They are to be complimented on the way they set about doing their work.  One could involve oneself in a long tirade about the who, why, where, what and when and still end where one started.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions relating to open disclosure.  Do the witnesses think that there was a resistance to full and open disclosure and a culture of resistance to same which may have had a bearing on the degree to which the various professionals responded to their patients?  There must be confidence in any system for it to operate properly.   I fully appreciate that confidence in the system has been dented and understand why this is so.  Regarding the two ladies referred to by Dr. Scally who switched consultants, what was their experience afterwards?  Did they have a similar experience or a different one, having changed consultant?<\/p> <p>  My next question concerns the accuracy of the tests and the screening programme.  Do the witnesses think that 80% or 85% accuracy had a bearing on the seriousness with which those examining the slides treated the task?  Did the expectation of only 85% accuracy mean that they felt that they did not have to be entirely accurate and could move on?  In terms of how the slides are examined, is it better to have two different people examining a slide at different intervals or at the same time, rather than having the same person review his or her own slide?  Which is better?  I would have thought that examination by a different person would be better, provided that he or she had no prior information on the earlier reading of the slide.  In that way, he or she would go about it in an unbiased manner.<\/p> <p>  How many other countries or jurisdictions have screening programmes similar to the one that operates here and how do those programmes compare?  Do they work better than ours?  Are they more accurate?  What are the comparative statistics in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to inoculation programmes in various countries and the fact that there can be reactions in some cases.  Is it possible to identify patients, with any degree of accuracy, who may react to a particular inoculation programme?  It would be hugely beneficial to all practitioners if that were possible.  Finally, are the witnesses satisfied that the recommendations in the report will be implemented unconditionally?

On open disclosure and how it operates, the acid test is how it operates in hard cases.  These were hard cases and it operated badly.  I would like to be able to say that there is really good experience elsewhere but I cannot do so.  The hyponatraemia inquiry in Northern Ireland, for example, with which I had some involvement, actually uncovered a much worse situation of cover up, lies and dishonesty among clinicians.  I am deeply disappointed that medical colleagues would behave in that sort of way.  When it comes to hard cases, there is an element of collegiality in the medical profession that is sometimes good but at other times, unhelpful.  It can be really unhelpful when it comes to telling patients and authorities the truth when things are going wrong.  I am very hopeful that this can and will be changed.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of switching clinicians, I do not know if the women went ahead with doing that.  I was hoping to ask them that last night but as they did not come along, I could not do so.  Like Deputy Durkan, I would like to know more.  I do not know if they have done so but I suspect that they may have gone ahead and switched clinicians.  Sometimes it is easier to start afresh with a different clinician and to build a new relationship, especially if there is any resistance to going back, sitting down and speaking the truth to each other.  That is difficult.  I look forward to hearing about that.  I worry about the fact that women continue to tell me that they are worried about their relationships with their clinicians because of all of this.  They would love resolution to it and I would hope that they find it.  I would certainly encourage any attempts that might be made in that regard.  I know that some of the women would like to sit down with their clinicians and discuss what happened in the light of my report and of everything that has happened.  They would very much like to say how they feel about what happened and would like their clinicians to tell them honestly about what went on.  I know that some women would like that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan's question about the inaccuracy of the test being used as an excuse for complacency is interesting.  I will think on that further but certainly some of the clinicians in their dealings with women dismissed things that went wrong on the basis that everyone knows that the test is not completely accurate.<\/p><p>I agree with the sentiment that lies behind the Deputy's question that it is not right or helpful.  It is our duty to make the tests as accurate as we possibly can.  I am hopeful that the shift next year to the HPV vaccine, which is a much more accurate test, will reduce that problem.<\/p><p> On the question about inoculation, we are not really here to discuss immunisation but part of the issue with it is that there are people who should not be immunised because of the likelihood of them reacting to a vaccine.  They are then entirely dependent on the rest of the population who can have the vaccine having the vaccine.  I wish there was a way to identify everyone who reacts but, sadly, that is not possible.  It comes back to what I was saying at the beginning about a compensation scheme that runs in the UK for immunisation.  It is a limited amount of money and there is a high level of disability involved in the judgments about that.  It is an important thing to look at nonetheless.  I invite Dr. Denton to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>There are a couple of other questions the Deputy asked that were laboratory specific.  On whether the perceived accuracy of the test had an impact on those doing the audit, I heard two aspects of that: the clinicians and the laboratories.  Having spoken to people in all the laboratories, I found they were all committed and keen to look again at the slides and learn what they could from them.  It interacts with the question of bias, however, because they knew these women had all developed cervical cancer.  Different individuals had different approaches to how much they tried to compensate for that bias, but it was not their fault because no one told them what to do.  There was no protocol that said one either must or must not compensate for this review bias.  The clinicians were all keen to learn what they could from reviewing these slides.<\/p> <p>  The protocol, such as it was, listed cases that had to go for an external review, and this can be found on pages 86 and 87 of the report.  Slides that were identified on internal review as having a significant difference were sent for an external review, which addresses the question the Deputy asked of whether there was another pair of eyes on them.  The difference between those internal reviews and the subsequent external reviews is what precipitated CervicalCheck to wonder if there might be an issue with the internal reviews.<\/p> <p>  I was also asked about how many other countries do an audit like this, and the answer is not many.  It is quite unusual.  The one we are most familiar is that which runs in England and Wales.

We feel disquiet about this because cancer can progress quite a lot over a period of 18 months.  In our view, that might make a significant difference to the outcome.

I also thank Dr. Scally and his colleagues for the work they are doing.<\/p><p> My remarks and questions relate to the position, comfort and status of girls and women in Ireland.  There is something going on here that goes beyond what is in the eye of this storm.  It goes to the heart of how comfortable, included and well-treated women and young girls are in this country.  Dr. Scally spoke of ensuring this would become an increasingly rare event and said he was honoured to meet and talk to many of the women concerned and took great encouragement from their help and support.  Those remarks need to be underlined and repeated.<\/p><p> Does Dr. Scally have a view on whether there may be governance and organisational issues that stretch from the Oireachtas?  This committee deals with health and has a relationship with the Department of Health and Health Service Executive.  While it is easy for us to talk about what happened elsewhere, everything that happens elsewhere is subject to oversight and responsibility.<\/p><p> No one would regard CervicalCheck screening or other health screening programmes as anything other than very positive developments.  As time goes on, I expect there will be more of these proactive interventions to try to catch nasty conditions before they come our way.  I am intrigued that despite our good motives, we have had unnecessary deaths and cases of near death, which have caused major anxiety?  I would appreciate any observations on that.<\/p><p> Speaking about the issue of open disclosure, Dr. Scally stated that many of the attitudes displayed by clinicians have no place in medicine.  He then spoke about attitude and culture and indicated he was hopeful that the culture would change.  He said that open disclosure had to be the rule rather than part of a menu.  What else will be necessary to encourage this change of culture?  Dr. Scally spoke about collegiality being both a good and bad thing.  This is evident in other areas of public service, including policing.<\/p><p> Dr. Scally spoke strongly on compensation being a core element, if I understood him properly.  Should a compensation fund become part of the cost of providing a service?  One will always hope that one does not fully expend it but it strikes me that if there is to be open disclosure and honesty, we must all be honest with people.  This means saying that sometimes, even with the best will, honest mistakes will be made.  We must have an upfront system that tries to remediate that.<\/p><p> Dr. Scally refers to the range of deficiencies he found.  He made 50 recommendations and may have made a 51st recommendation this morning.  We have had 25 or more years of tribunals, inquiries and scandals.  It strikes me that this could, sadly, become another inquiry with a big report, which lays out all the issues.  If Dr. Scally met someone at a bus stop or in a waiting room and the person realised who he was and asked him what are the three, four or five things that need to happen to turn this around, what would he say?<\/p><p> We have had a love affair with finding people and entities to blame and responsibility must be borne.

He asked about the Oireachtas and its potential role in this matter.  I will link that with his final comment on finding people to blame.  It is undoubtedly true that there is an appetite to find people to blame.  In this situation, I do not know where one stops.  Senator Dolan invited me to speak about the role of the Oireachtas and politicians in all of this.  A reason we have this problem, as Dr. Denton has indicated, is that cervical screening is relatively recent in this country, having been in place for only the past ten years.  It has been in place in the UK for 20 years and in a number of other European countries for much younger.  I find it difficult to understand why it took an eight-year pilot before the programme was introduced.  An eight-year pilot for a programme that has been well tried and tested elsewhere does not make sense to me.  I have no idea why that occurred.<\/p> <p>  As the Senator will have gathered from the report, I am critical about the removal of the external governance of the HSE and that situation going on for so long.  I am very pleased that it has been restored and with the appointment of the chair.  A fine chairman has been chosen and I have confidence in that person.  It is very unfortunate that certain things happened, for example, the decision to postpone the implementation of the HPV vaccination.  I am very pleased that is in place now and that vaccination are on the way up.  There was a decision to postpone its implementation.<\/p> <p>  As I have expressed already, I am a strong advocate - I hope there is no longer any argument about it - for the necessity of a statutory duty of candour being placed on individuals.  The Oireachtas had the opportunity to do that and chose not to, for whatever reason.  One can look at the entire system, from legislators all the way down to people on the ground, and find things that did not go well.  I said I am hopeful that the culture will change.  By nature, I am an optimist, but I come from Belfast where there is a saying that an optimist is someone who has not heard the bad news yet.<\/p><p>I hope there will not be bad news about these 50 recommendations.  I hope they will be implemented and that the country will get the cervical screening service it deserves.  I will certainly be doing what I can and what I am asked to do to help in that respect.<\/p><p> Regarding changing the culture, I have indicated in the report that certain provisions need to be put in place, including a national screening committee centre.  On the Deputy's question on the future of other programmes, particularly in this modern age of genetics, I am quite confident other screening programmes will come forward.  Ireland does not yet have a proper mechanism for looking at screening in a highly professional and consistent way, which is why I have recommended that a national screening committee be put in place.  That would serve the country well in the future and would enable a rational approach to screening and oversight.  <\/p><p> It will not have escaped the Deputy's attention that among my recommendations I made two regarding matters I have mentioned.  I recommended there should be patient advocates on the board of the HSE.  I also recommended that there should be patient advocates on the national screening committee, and I have made other similar recommendations in the report.  I have been deeply impressed by the advocacy shown by some of the people affected, notably Vicky Phelan, who exposed much of it.  I was also deeply impressed by some of the patient advocates involved in the Madden committee some time ago.  I would encourage that approach to involving patient advocates at the highest level but with one caveat.  I recall one day chairing a committee, on which we had  included patient advocates, and as I looked around those attending it occurred to me that the only people who were not being paid to be there were the patient advocates.  I am conscious that is unfair and exploitative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>It must be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>There are people with respect to this issue who are making enormous sacrifices to try to aid and move it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>We should not in any sense be seen to be exploiting patient advocates.

I firmly believe that.<\/p> <p>  Another element is to ensure there is a better understanding of citizenry among the citizens of the Republic of Ireland.  I am still not convinced that the people do not have too deferential an idea of doctors.  They need to be more robust in dealing with the medical profession and to have higher expectations of doctors.  The public should not hold them in awe any longer.  Those days have long gone.  I hope this report and the exposure of some of the ridiculous attitudes that they hold will encourage the public to be intolerant.  Because I come from Belfast I am an advocate of intolerance at times.  Being intolerant of doctors who are patronising and sexist is a good thing to be.  I would encourage people to address that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of compensation, the Deputy's point was very well made.  Part of the cost-benefit analysis of a screening programme should include issues of compensation for those who are actively damaged by the screening programme just as it needs to take into account the physical damage that can sometimes be caused by over-investigation as a result of a screening test, or the anxiety that results from having a screening test and then having to wait a very long time for the results.  That is a stress on people that should be avoided if at all possible.<\/p> <p>  I firmly believe that patients turn to lawyers and litigation as a last resort in the absence of any other way of getting their issues dealt with.  The best way of stopping the lawyers getting involved and the costs associated with that is to return to the points elements I mentioned, namely, telling patients what has gone wrong and why, getting someone who is responsible to say \"sorry\" and mean it, and assuring them that everything will be done to try to ensure it is not repeated.  All the evidence from across the world shows that if that is done properly the public is much less likely to go to court to seek satisfaction.  I have seen it happen many times where people go to court, sue and the only way the courts have of responding to that is in terms of a financial settlement.  Such a settlement may be fine in one sense, but it does not bring resolution for many people.  I look forward to Mr. Justice Meehan's proposals and to reading what he has to suggest in regard to that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding three, four or five key points, one is open disclosure; the second is a national screening committee; the third is that screening services need to be brought out of the cold, given a higher profile within the HSE and better management; and the fourth, which is a negative rather than a positive point, we should not indulge in the blame game anymore that we have to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Scally"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Deputies Kelly and O'Connell want to raise two brief issues and then I will bring in Senator Swanick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00800","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>In fairness, Senator Swanick should speak before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#P00900","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I had to step out to deal with a Commencement Matter in the Seanad.

In the last week, it has become an issue of higher importance for the inquiry team and today it becomes an issue of huge importance for us.  The comment on patient advocates is spot-on.  Demographically, it is impossible to get the appropriate people to sit on all of these groups unless there is going to be some form of recompense for their time off work.  One will not get people of my age or younger to join a group because of the cost of child care and so on.  That must be dealt with and as a committee we should advocate a payment.<\/p> <p>  We will not get to it now, but the RCOG review will not deal with the question I have asked about why the laboratories were not investigated under their contracts when issues were found.  That needs to be dealt with somewhere.  In fairness to Dr. Scally, he has said that quality control was, in effect, a joke and was not in place after 2014.  We do not even know what was going on or who was accountable.  All of that must be encapsulated somewhere.  It is a big chunk that was missing.  It is no one's fault, but it is missing.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the inquiry team's follow-up work on the laboratories and outsourcing.  I have read the commentary on this in the report in detail.  Is the team confident that there are not other locations and laboratories to which some of these laboratories may have outsourced on top of what we know now?  In other words, is this limited to just those laboratories?<\/p> <p>  As regards accountability, I have no confidence in the HSE investigating itself.  Given the day that is in it, there will have to be some second-phase forum involving Dr. Scally on accountability for what we have just discussed, namely quality assurance and contract management.  I am with Dr. Scally on the people working in CervicalCheck in Limerick.  They are not the issue here.  It is higher up the food chain.<\/p> <p>  It has often been missed that the audit has stopped.  What are the consequences of that?  Are we going to have a delayed problem here?

According to the report, CervicalCheck organised the training of those responsible for imparting that information, so it is, surely, at fault for the poor training in that regard.<\/p><p>My main concern is that before any of this started I assumed that CervicalCheck checked the slides.  I assumed there was a lab somewhere with people checking slides.  We now know that doctors or nurses take smears in the community and labs abroad test some of the samples.  Page 26 of the report details the organisational structure of CervicalCheck.  If outside services were responsible for the testing and screening, the people whose roles are detailed on page 26 seem to have only been administering a service.  As they only had one meeting in ten years and nobody was joined up, they do not seem to have had any proper role.  The early part of the report twice refers to nobody being in charge.  A concern of mine is that in January 2014 the NSS moved into the directorate of health and well-being.  I cannot see any logical reason for that and such is not detailed in the report.  Is there any reason for that move?<\/p><p>On the job description, although it is a funny anecdote it is very serious because even in the smallest business one is required to have a job description.  It is very easy to ensure it is in place.  I worked in the NHS.  It is very easy to make sweeping statements that the NHS or the HSE is dysfunctional but this is a prime example of an arm of the organisation that is as bad as we could imagine.<\/p><p>On page 29 there is a reference to the recession.  Is that the only excuse for incompetence that was offered to Dr. Scally?  It seems like a fairly weak excuse.<\/p><p>On page 30 it states: &ldquo;The QA Committee had a number of subgroups that concentrated on the development of standards for key functions in the screening process, such as cytopathology, primary care, histopathology, colposcopy and administration.&rdquo;  Is there a reason screening standards were not included in that or am I missing something?<\/p><p>The report states on page 32 that all was not well in the screening process.  On what evidence is that comment based?  Do we know anything about why CPL stopped screening in 2013?  Is there any reason for that other than financial concerns?<\/p><p>The National Screening Service risk register report for October 2017 is quoted on page 35 as stating, &quot;<i>Clinical Audit process established and embedded in CervicalCheck by December 2017.<\/i>&quot;The report then states: &quot;This is also difficult to understand, as the audit process commenced many years previously.&quot;  Discussion of the audit process began in 2009.  It seems the relevant CervicalCheck staff were just making forms, creating standard operating procedures, having meetings and basically doing nothing.<\/p><p>Although he may not have wanted an answer to the question, Dr. Scally asked why there was an eight-year pilot and why it took so long to roll out the HPV vaccine.  We were coming from a very primitive background in this country in terms of women&rsquo;s health.  If one looks at the media coverage of the roll-out of screening and the HPV vaccine, one will note comments by some religious organisations that one would not need a HPV vaccine if one led a pure and chaste life.  That is the reason for the delay.  There was huge pushback when the Minister for Health at the time, Ms Mary Harney, brought in cervical screening.  Connections were made between a person's lifestyle and positive screening results.

I know that sometimes the right hand side of the room is a bit difficult to see.  An improvement in the Acting Chairman's peripheral vision is needed.  Two questions come to mind.  First, Dr. Scally made an interesting reference a few minutes ago in respect of the chain of command.  This is something we have raised at these meetings on many occasions.  Is there a chain of command?  To what extent does it work?  It used to be a product of the old health boards.  In the health boards there was a programme manager who was responsible for a series of issues and protocols.  He or she was regularly held responsible for those.  I believe that has disappeared and does not exist any more.<\/p> <p>  The other question that comes to mind, to which reference has already been made, relates to tendering.  I used to be a kind of half-expert on tendering once upon a time and in a different capacity.  To what extent did visits take place to the laboratories that were likely to tender?  Were all laboratories visited?  Were the terms set out in the tender documents such as to ensure that all possibilities were catered for in the future, including the issues about ISO standards and so on?  Whenever I see reference to tendering I get uneasy.  It is a feeling which has affected me on many occasions in the past.  I wonder about that.  Are there grounds for optimism in respect of the tendering process?  How was it gone about?  Who actually promoted it?  Who was in charge of it?  How were the tenders opened?  Were they opened in public?  Perhaps Dr. Scally would like to comment on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101000002#T04700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I do not have answers on those points, as Deputy Durkan will understand, but they are valuable and we will include them in the work we are doing.

The purpose of our first session is to consider a Government motion to exercise the right to opt in, pursuant to Protocol 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to two measures in the civil justice area.

The three-month period during which Ireland can make the necessary notifications of our intention to participate in the adoption and application of a proposed measure is linked with the timing of that proposed measure becoming available in all official EU languages.  We became aware during the summer recess that all language versions of one of the proposals which is before the committee today were available with effect from 18 July, and that the effective date in respect of the other proposed measure was 25 July.  As the proposals are being dealt with together in the interests of efficiency, it is the intention that the required notifications will be made by 18 October.  Negotiations have already started so there is an additional degree of urgency attaching to this matter.<\/p> <p>  The proposals which are before the committee today are for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 1393\/2007 on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, and for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206\/2001 on co-operation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters.  I appreciate that the issues before the committee do not, at first glance, seem to be as significant as those with which it normally deals.  Nonetheless, the scrutiny of these proposals by this committee is important in its own right and is also a necessary step in facilitating the moving of the motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas, which will enable the opt-in to both measures to be exercised.  <\/p> <p>  Committee members will be familiar with the legal basis of the proposals which are before us today.  That legal basis is to be found in Title V of Part 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, otherwise known as the Lisbon treaty.  The application of Title V to Ireland is subject to the provisions of Protocol 21, which provides that Ireland shall not take part in the adoption and application by the Council of proposed measures under Title V, unless it notifies its wish to do so in accordance with Article 3 of the protocol, within three months of the proposal being presented to the Council.  Under the same protocol, Ireland may at any time after the adoption of a measure by the Council under Title V notify the Council and the Commission, in accordance with Article 4 of the protocol, that it wishes to accept that measure.  <\/p> <p>  Article 4a of the same protocol provides that the opt-in provisions of the protocol also apply to any measure, proposed or adopted under Title V, which amends an Act into which Ireland has already opted.  That provision of the protocol is of particular significance where the measures which are before the committee today are concerned.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the service of documents, there have been two previous proposals on this matter, in both of which Ireland has participated from the outset.  The current proposal builds upon the previous proposals in an organic way, and non-participation at this time could be misunderstood both by the Commission and by our EU partners.  The service of documents is a critical element in a range of EU instruments operating within the civil justice space, and the view may be taken that our participation in the amended service instrument is essential for the effective functioning of those instruments.  In this regard it should be borne in mind that Article 4a of the protocol contemplates the possibility that, if non-participation by the UK or Ireland in an amended version of an existing measure makes the application of that measure inoperable for the member states or the Union, the existing measure shall no longer be binding upon or applicable to the UK or to Ireland, as appropriate.  <\/p> <p>  Where the taking of evidence proposal is concerned, Ireland has participated in the 2001 regulation on the taking of evidence from the outset.  The efficiency of judicial procedures in civil or commercial matters requires that the transmission and execution of requests for the performance of taking of evidence should be made directly and by the most rapid means possible between member states&rsquo; courts using modern digital technology.  For similar reasons to the service of documents proposal, continued participation in the evidence regulation and its proposed amendment is considered to be highly desirable.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the proposals themselves, as I said already, they provide for amendments to existing regulations in the area of service of documents and the taking of evidence.  In both cases the existing regulations apply to civil and commercial matters in cross-border cases.  I propose to deal first with the proposal for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 1393\/2007 on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.  The existing service of documents regulation provides for fast-track channels and uniform procedures for transmitting documents from one member state to another, for the purposes of service in the latter.  The regulation includes certain minimum standards on the protection of the rights of defence, including providing that papers to be served on a party must be written in, or accompanied by a translation into, either a language which the addressee understands, or the official language of the member state addressed.  Uniform legal conditions are already in place for serving a document by post directly across borders.  <\/p> <p>  The European Commission has conducted a review of the operation of the 2007 regulation and while it concluded in broad terms that its application and operation was satisfactory, it also took the view that the passage of time, developments in respect of other regulations and advances in information and communications technology gave rise to a need to propose amendments to it.  The aim of the amending proposal is to streamline and modernise the arrangements for service of documents between member states, thus making them more effective and efficient.  The proposal clarifies that the regulation applies in all situations where the addressee is resident in another member state, with the aim of ending the current questionable practice in some member states of serving documents in that same member state on parties in another member state by what are referred to as alternative or fictitious methods of service of documents.<\/p> <p>  As part of the modernisation process the amending proposal envisages utilising, where possible, modern information and communications technology rather than existing paper-based systems.  It is proposed that communication and exchange of documents between sending and receiving authorities would be carried out electronically, through a decentralised IT system made up of national IT systems interconnected by a secure and reliable communications infrastructure. <\/p> <p>  Another element of the amending proposal is for member states to assist in locating a person on whom a document is to be served.  The proposal offers three alternative options, from which each member state must provide at least one in its territory for persons asserting their rights from other member states.  Those three options include provision of judicial assistance through authorities designated by the member states.  Also included is the provision of access to public domicile registers through the e-justice portal, or provision of detailed information via the e-justice portal on available tools for locating persons in their territories.<\/p> <p>  Further new provisions are those which concern electronic service of documents, where it is proposed that such electronic service would be an additional alternative method of service under the regulation, and treated as the equivalent of service by post.  In addition, the existing provision concerning the rights of the addressee to refuse service of a document in certain circumstances is strengthened and clarified in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice.  Finally, the current provisions concerning the giving of a judgment in default of appearance are updated.   <\/p> <p>  I will turn to the proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206\/2001 on co-operation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters.  The existing 2001 taking of evidence regulation provides for the taking of evidence in a member state other than the one in which judicial proceedings are or can be brought.  This is an important instrument for European judicial co-operation given that it is often crucial to present sufficient evidence to the court to prove a claim.  The regulation establishes an EU-wide system for the direct and rapid transmission of requests for the taking of evidence between courts and lays down precise rules as to the form and content of such requests.  The efficiency of judicial procedures in civil or commercial matters requires that the transmission and execution of requests for the performance of taking of evidence is made directly and by the most rapid means possible between the courts of the member states.<\/p> <p>  The regulation provides for two methods of taking of evidence; first, the taking of evidence by the requested court following a request transmitted directly from the requesting court to the requested court; and second, the direct taking of evidence by the requesting court.<\/p> <p>  The initiative to amend the 2001 taking of evidence regulation is closely linked to the initiative concerning the service of documents regulation which I have just outlined.  In 2017, the European Commission conducted an evaluation to assess the operation of the existing regulation.  It has been acknowledged that overall the regulation has made a contribution to achieving objectives and has improved the efficiency of legal proceedings.  It increases mutual trust between courts and helps to reduce the burden for citizens and businesses engaged in cross-border proceedings.  However, according to the evaluation report, contacts between the bodies designated by the regulation are still almost exclusively paper-based, with adverse impacts on cost and effectiveness.  Also, video-conferencing is rarely used to hear persons in another member state.  <\/p> <p>  The aim of the amending proposal is to improve the smooth functioning of the area of freedom, security and justice, and of the Internal Market, by increasing the efficiency and speed of the cross-border taking of evidence.  It proposes to achieve this by adapting Regulation (EC) No. 1206\/2001 to technical developments, exploiting the advantages of digitalisation and ensuring that more use is made of video-conferencing.  It is hoped that the initiative will increase legal certainty and thereby help to avoid delays and undue costs for citizens, businesses and public administrations and address shortcomings in the protection of parties&rsquo; procedural rights.  <\/p> <p>  I will now outline the principal amendments proposed to be made to the taking of evidence regulation No. 1206\/2001.  It is proposed to replace Article 6 of the regulation dealing with the transmission of requests and other communications.  This amendment introduces the mandatory electronic transmission of requests and communications through a decentralised IT system composed of national IT systems interconnected by a communications infrastructure.  It is proposed to amend Article 17 and to insert a new Article 17a in order to ensure more frequent and faster use of direct taking of evidence in accordance with Article 17 via video-conference where this available to the courts in question.  It is proposed to insert a new Article 17b to facilitate the taking of evidence by diplomatic officers or consular agents.  This relates to the taking of evidence, in another member state, by hearing nationals of the member state which they represent.<\/p><p>It is proposed to insert the new Article 18(a) to ensure that digital evidence taken in accordance with the law of the member state where it was taken is not rejected as evidence in another member state solely due to its digital nature.<\/p><p> Overall, the proposal to amend the regulations seeks to address the need for modernisation, in particular digitalisation and the use of modern technology, in the cross-border taking of evidence.  These changes are expected to generate benefits for citizens and businesses involved in cross-border proceedings.  <\/p><p> Negotiations on both proposals which we are examining today commenced on 4 October.  Ireland has, in the past, taken a positive approach to participation in the various civil law instruments which have been presented and our approach on this occasion is in keeping with past practice.  It is important that we honour the commitment given in the context of successive treaties that we will take part in relevant measures in the justice area to the maximum extent possible and early opt-in does not necessarily mean that all elements of the Commission's proposals are acceptable to us.  It will, however, strengthen our hand in terms of any policy stance which we may take, whether alone or in consultation with other member states.  That policy stance will be influenced by appropriate consultation with interested parties including relevant Government Departments and the Courts Service.  It is important that Ireland is seen to be in a position to play a full part in these negotiations and a positive response to the motions which have been tabled will facilitate that objective.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for making the time available to deal with these matters today.  I look forward to the comments of the committee members and am happy to address any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#D00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>The Minister of State might like to take a breath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#E00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is skilled in delivering such a detailed paper and he did so well.

As has been mentioned, I head up the operational support department and am based at the PSNI headquarters in Belfast.  I have had senior responsibility for the delivery of local policing for more than 12 years as the operational district commander for Newry, Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon and as the chief superintendent and assistant chief constable for local policing across Northern Ireland.  I am also the national lead in the UK for police contact management and am a director of the Police ICT Company in London.  I have had the privilege of working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for many years, including with the gentlemen to my right in particular but also the rest of the senior team, on cross-Border investigations, cross-Border operations and cross-Border major event planning.  I am a graduate of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na executive development programme, which is run by the Garda with the UCS Smurfit School, and I am the co-author of the cross-Border strategies involving the Garda, PSNI and the respective justice Departments, North and South.<\/p> <p>  Since early 2018, I have been involved in a PSNI review of local policing across Northern Ireland.  This review became necessary because our society, crime and, accordingly, how we delivered policing were changing.  While crime in Northern Ireland has reduced significantly over the past ten years, we know from experience that the complexity and type of work faced by policing has become more challenging, for example, the changing nature of public protection work.  The increasing vulnerability in society is also having an impact on policing.  The PSNI regularly deals with approximately 150 calls for service each day linked to a person with identified mental health issues or a related vulnerability.  The growth of cyber-enabled crime has impacted on policing significantly, as has the emergence of more diverse communities and an ageing population.  In addition to these changing and growing demands, we have a reducing police budget and fewer police officers and police staff.<\/p> <p>  These impacts are felt right across policing and, indeed, our partners.  I would, however, contend that the greatest impacts are likely to be felt in local policing, where there is something of a triple impact.  The first impact is that, in organisations where resources are under pressure, local policing as a resource-intensive area will be required to make savings or reduce numbers as part of that effort.  This may be accompanied by the consolidation or centralisation of some functions or resources to achieve economies of scale.<\/p> <p>  The second impact is that, with the increasing complexity in demand, more specialist skills and roles are being deployed within policing to meet them.  This increase in specialism in public protection, cybercrime and interagency working, to name but a few areas, inevitably serves to draw further resources away from local policing.<\/p> <p>  The third impact is that, with increasing demands and reducing resources, the amount of reactive service provision required to be delivered through local officers and its increasing complexity are putting added pressure on the ability to do proactive and preventative work in local communities and fulfil the associated community engagement roles.<\/p> <p>  These issues are reflected in recent UK reports published on the matter.  The National Effectiveness Review 2016 of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Services on the functions of neighbourhood policing teams, the College of Policing's modernising neighbourhood policing guidelines published this year and the Police Foundation's report, The Future of Neighbourhood Policing, which was also published in 2018, all point to these stresses and strains.<\/p> <p>  While the choices being made have a sound basis in threat, risk and harm and in policing and keeping people safe, the inevitable reduction in the visibility of local police, perhaps combined with local station closures, has an impact on public confidence in policing and satisfaction in local services, which were previously based on visibility, accessibility and familiarity.  It can also be argued that some of these impacts are felt more in rural communities, including cross-Border ones.  In recognition of this, the PSNI has had for some years a rural crime lead who oversees the PSNI's rural crime strategy and the related delivery by us and our partners.  This sits alongside relationships and practices established under the original cross-Border policing strategy and that the refreshed cross-Border policing strategy seeks to further develop under a specific strand of work, that being, policing with the community in rural areas.  This work entails continuing to build on existing practical co-operation to develop a joint Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na-Police Service of Northern Ireland crime prevention strategy for the Border region, which will assist the joint Garda-PSNI tasking and co-ordination group.<\/p> <p>  Funding for policing is a political choice.  There are pressures and challenges, but there are also opportunities and answers.  Policing and service delivery will need to change and choices will have to be made.  Communities and other stakeholders need to be part of that discussion and the decision on what that will look like.  There are opportunities that, if properly considered and well delivered, can continue to keep people safe and build confidence in policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Todd for his opening address.

As the people who deal with the victims of rural crime, especially burglaries, every day, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acutely conscious of the impact this crime has on people, families and communities, both urban and rural, and in particular vulnerable victims.  Burglary is not just an economic crime.  It is one that can have a devastating impact on people emotionally and personally.  That is why we are so determined to tackle it.<\/p> <p>  In November 2015, the Garda introduced Operation Thor, with which the members are familiar.  It was a new approach with a large number of units across a wide range of different areas and disciplines working together to prevent and detect burglaries based on analysis of crime trends and intelligence to target criminal gangs and repeat offenders.  It saw us denying criminal gangs the use of the motorway network and increasing patrolling in areas worst affected by burglaries.  It has resulted in many of those involved in burglary being arrested and charged.  Since November 2015, more than 8,300 arrests have been made, more than 9,500 charges have been preferred, 34,000 searches and 203,771 patrols have been undertaken, and 143,231 checkpoints have been mounted.  In addition, we have heavily publicised locally and nationally crime prevention advice through our \"Lock Up and Light Up\" campaign.  All of this activity has seen residential burglaries reduce by 34% and non-residential burglaries down 23% since November 2015.<\/p> <p>  We have maintained that focus in 2018.  This year up to the end of August, residential burglaries are down 17% on the same period last year.  However, we will not be complacent, particularly when we are coming to the time of the year when burglaries traditionally increase due to the longer winter nights.  We also know that, while we have significantly reduced burglaries, this is no comfort to those who are burglary victims or are in fear of being a victim, particularly elderly people living in isolated areas.  In this regard, the winter phase of Operation Thor has started.<\/p><p>There will be increased patrolling and more checkpoints with a particular focus on criminal gangs and repeat offenders.  The assistant commissioner for special crime operations is meeting all the detective superintendents from across the country tomorrow to reinforce this message.  <\/p><p> I ask members of the public to lock up and light up, particularly in the evenings.  During the winter, nearly 40% of burglaries happen between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m.  Burglars are most likely to enter homes through the rear door or a window.  I ask members of the public to use timer switches to make their homes look occupied, lock their doors and windows and not to keep large amounts of cash in the home.  We also ask people to mark their property so that when we recover it, and we recover a large amount of property each year, we can return it to them.  It is vital that people report crimes.  We can only investigate crimes reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and each and every crime is investigated.<\/p><p> Thefts from farms have fallen nationally by 8% in the past year, but again we are not being complacent.  We fully recognise the terrible impact theft from farms can have on the livelihoods of farmers and their families and their sense of security.  We are continuing to work with local communities, community groups and farming bodies to reduce farm theft.  For example, this was a major focus for the Garda during the recent ploughing championships.  We advise members of the farming community to restrict access to their yards, lock gates when not in use and ensure their property is well lit as more farm thefts occur at night than during the day.  Farmers should also ensure that machinery, tools and vehicles are secured properly and details such as serial numbers and property markings are recorded and photographed.<\/p><p> In the context of community policing, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is dedicated to policing with the consent and support of the community.  We have a strong connection with the community we serve and maintaining and enhancing that bond is one of our key priorities.  We recognise, however, that we need to change in this area.  Society is changing at a rapid pace and we have to keep up.  Society is demanding a more responsive service and we will meet that demand.  With the numbers of garda&iacute; starting to increase, we can put in place measures to deliver a policing service that is better positioned to address the concerns of local communities.  We will ensure community policing is the ethos of policing in Ireland.<\/p><p> As identified by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, like many police services around the world, has struggled to put in place structures and practices that support a truly community orientated police service.  The commission acknowledged the work done and innovation shown by many excellent garda&iacute; in this area but found that their implementation of community policing lacked specific direction.  International research has shown that changing this requires more than just a technical fix.  It needs restructuring, decentralisation of decision making, greater empowerment of front-line officers and, most critically, having an external focus where we regularly and actively listen and react to the needs of the community.  It requires that all our personnel have a strong community orientation.<\/p><p> As the Garda Commissioner has said, the Commission on the Future of Policing provides the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a pathway in this area and other areas to improve our service in conjunction with our policing partners.  In this regard, following extensive research we are developing a new model of community policing based on delivering localised policing services to meet the differing needs of different communities.  It will result in our systems and structures being reorganised with the aim of having a real and deep understanding of other communities and what citizens require from a modern police service.  It will reinforce that communities and their needs are at the heart of the organisation.  The division will co-ordinate all community issues and develop tailored policing responses to communities based on their needs.  This approach will be part of the new proof of concept divisional policing model that we will introduce in four divisions, namely, Galway, Mayo, Cork city and Kevin Street, in the first quarter of 2019.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a public service and must provide a quality service that meets the needs of the public.  That is the focus of our approach to community policing and policing in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank Assistant Commissioner Leahy.

It is pretty much the same picture across the United Kingdom.  This debate on the visibility of local policing has been going back and forth since I joined the police service and that was not yesterday.  I can remember a chief constable in Bristol saying 25 years ago there will be no more cops on the beat and coming under significant political fire for making that statement.  That debate has continued until now in the way the Deputy outlined it.<\/p> <p>  Local communities take a significant degree of reassurance from seeing their local police.  I spoke earlier about visibility as well as accessibility and familiarity, in other words, people see the police, can make contact with them when they want to and they knows who they are.  This means people feel linked and engaged with the police.  The significant reassurance that comes from that should not be underestimated.  Similarly, we talk about police stations and the very fact that bricks and mortar provide confidence for local communities because they have a police station.  If a police station is closed or moved, it is generally a source of significant local stress.  All of those things have a value for the community.<\/p> <p>  In light of changing demands and the complexity of the circumstances we face, it is difficult to put one's finger on the cash value of having police officers on patrol providing reassurance.  Then we get into the debate as to whether we know the cost of everything but the value of nothing.  The honest answer to this question lies betwixt and between the cost and the value.  Most emerging models try to bridge that space by having local based teams which are also responsible for a substantial amount of service delivery.  Depending on how this approach is modelled, it can work very well because every time a crime or an incident is reported, it presents an opportunity for the local team to engage and be involved in problem solving and building of solutions around that.  If one puts too much into that aspect, the teams do not get to engage in policing and instead become response teams engaged in what amounts to fire-fighting, which is a pejorative term in these circumstances.  Everybody draws a line and strikes a balance in a different place but finding the right balance is one of the tricks in designing a model.  The stress has been there for many years and no one professes to have the wisdom to solve this issue.<\/p> <p>  On ways to do this differently and sometimes better, the PSNI now has a social media outreach with more than 900,000 followers.  In most towns in Northern Ireland more people follow the PSNI on social media platforms than ever meet a police officer.  We need to be clever about how we use this platform and publicise it daily.  For example, we can show people that while they were at work, we were patrolling their area, making arrests or recovering property.

Another issue is capital costs and whether it is worth spending capital on maintaining buildings that are not in use.

I will go back to one of the questions Deputy O'Callaghan asked earlier about community policing and boots on the ground.  We have reached a watershed in terms of the report on the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I have the report before me.  The report, on page 17, states:<\/p><blockquote>There are many excellent garda&iacute; who know their communities well and perform an exemplary service, but it is clear that the community policing system as a whole is under strain.  Neither the structure of the police organisation nor its practices support the image it has of itself as a community police service.<\/blockquote> <p>That is a fairly strong statement.  Basically, it indicates that we are not structured and the practices we are engaged in reflect something other than a community policing service.  The report identifies and acknowledges the islands of innovation and the individuals who have put great work into community policing.  The commission is effectively asking us to do a complete flip in terms of how we deliver the service.  The commission is looking for a paradigm shift.  I know this because I have discussed it with members of the commission.  I have tried to get inside their heads to find out what exactly they had in mind when they were discussing this.  They are looking at something really different.  They are saying that we have to change what we do considerably and that we have to bring all instruments of the organisation into alignment with a community policing ethos.  They are looking for a paradigm shift.  One of the members of the commission stated that the commission got a clarion call from communities to the effect that this is what they want from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They want a community policing service that we can really call a community policing service.  Our structures and practices need to reflect that.  They are saying we need to change our philosophy.  If we are to call ourselves a community policing service then our activities behaviours and structures should reflect that.  Really, what we are looking at is something altogether different.  Internationally, there is a language of community policing that exists but when we start to dismantle it, much of it amounts to tinkering at the edges while the traditional model remains at the core of policing.  The commission is asking us to change that substantially.<br\/><br\/>I will set out what we are bringing to the table.  The framework we are developing at the moment is attempting to address this but it will come with significant challenges.  Changing the orientation of policing and changing the philosophy towards a community orientation have not really been achieved anywhere.  Generally speaking, police forces have add-ons and we have all seen that in operation for years.  For example, there may be a handful of really good people and some great initiatives.  We have great initiatives throughout the country but the commission is saying there is no national structured approach to community policing.  It is almost an add-on to the traditional model.  We are being asked to do something significant and it would be important to go through that with the committee at some stage.  We need to tease out how we perceive this and what it will look like.  We may need a presentation on that at some stage.  We are being asked to engage in a paradigm shift and it is important to get that message out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I am pleased to hear that because community policing is sometimes a motherhood-and-apple-pie concept: everyone is in favour of it but no one really knows what it is.

Then, when resources get undermined and reduced, it can stay there and remain unaffected by the vagaries of the Garda budget.  Is that the objective of the new model of community policing the Garda is working on at present?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#H00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>That is the framework on which we are working.  It will represent a complete restructuring of what we have in place.  The idea is that we will have a national structure and that we will be able to know from a national position down who owns every area in the country in terms of community policing.  The idea is that, as the national lead in this area, I know who the community garda is in west Kerry or Cahersiveen and that we can communicate directly.  The idea is that the people in these locations know who their community garda is as well.  We are aiming to achieve a situation whereby everyone will know who their community garda is.  Although everyone on the commission says that all of those at district level will be community garda&iacute;, there has to be a graduated level of community orientation.  This is because detectives are detectives and while they need a community policing ethos, they have to be skilled in other areas too.<\/p> <p>  We maintain that the entire front line will be geared towards community policing.  Training, recruitment, promotion and so on &ndash; these are all instruments - need to be aligned to show that is the case.  This is a real orientation towards community.  We have to take a complete outside-in perspective.  We will have to put in place the technology and some sort of customer relationship management system to connect us completely with the community.  The idea is that we are in constant communication with them and that we are logging and tracking all the issues that arise.  These are non-emergency issues but we need a full problem-solving approach to policing.  The idea is that someone owns it and is responsible and accountable for it at street level, team level and as part of a national structure.  That is what we are being asked to do and that is what we are working on.<\/p> <p>  We had a draft ready for some time and we were moving in this direction but, in light of the commission report, there was no point in moving on it.  Using the census data and a satellite mapping tool we mapped out the entire country.  Every division in the county has been mapped out down to a Central Statistics Office level.  We have all the data captured.  Many areas have been mapped out to what we term community policing area level.

We will get it off the ground in the first quarter with the four divisions.  Assistant Commissioner Finn is responsible for this aspect of the new divisional model.

It is interesting for us from several points of view.  The similarities North and South are interesting, as are some of the differences.  Perhaps we could explore the whole area of co-operation along Border communities, especially given the onset of Brexit and so forth.  What level of engagement has been embarked on in terms of rural crime?<\/p> <p>  I am struck by a particular matter.  We are sick of the lads being before the committee.  We have them in all the time and we are well used to them but it is an extra privilege to have Mr. Todd before us in order that we might learn from his experience.  We often look to the PSNI model post-Patten.  We say it was instrumental in shaking up the culture that existed previously.  One point made by Mr. Todd is striking.  He said that the level of evaluation and analysis has continued into the evolving role of a police service.  We are a little behind in the South perhaps but we have begun that process.  It has been added to a little by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland but we are still a little behind the PSNI.<\/p> <p>  This may be a little eclectic but several points stand out for me.  One emerged last week on foot of the presentations we received.  It relates to the service changing from a more traditional role in crime, targeting, arrest and detection into being far broader in scope.  Mr. Todd referred to 150 calls each day linked to mental health issues.  That would have emerged in a project we did on the Prison Service and the number of people who are incarcerated now who traditionally would have been in psychiatric institutions.  The criminal justice system has become a hoover for many social problems.  How does the PSNI deal with that?  What is the interface?  I imagine it is a question of the interface between the PSNI and other organisations.  In the South, it has certainly been something of a problem in engaging with the likes of Tusla, the HSE and others organisations.  How does the PSNI deal with the connection with other state agencies that deal with health and mental health?  Mr. Todd referred to specialist services and the requirement for more specialist skills to deal with those areas.<\/p><p>How does the PSNI deal with the emphasis away from crime and detection to being something much broader?  We have identified in the South as well, but the PSNI may have been dealing with it a bit longer.  The numbers in the Police Service of Northern Ireland have greatly reduced.  Obviously there were security elements in that, following the Good Friday Agreement and all of that.  The PSNI seems to have managed quite well with lower numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#H00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>If I miss any pieces, the Deputy will bring me back because there is quite a bit in that.  I will deal with the partnership aspect first.  I am not being humorous in this.  When communities say that they never see the police I could quip that if one pops into accident and emergency departments one will generally find them there.  That is really indicative of the crossover between healthcare and criminal justice issues, and the number of people coming into the criminal justice system because of missed opportunities, service gaps or whatever the causation is on the health or education side of the equation.<\/p> <p>  That has been increasing.  In 2007 and 2008 when the security situation was improving markedly, a previous visitor to this committee from the PSNI, Sir Hugh Orde, introduced armed response units as a tentative step towards a routinely unarmed service in an improving situation.  I was a commander at the time.  It was a significant drain on my resources to establish that new resource.  I had some reticence and scepticism about the wisdom of that choice.  I am now in charge of those units as part of my portfolio.  While they are really busy, they are not busy doing the task for which they were configured.  Armed response units were introduced to deal with gun crime, knife crime and people who are dangerous committing crime.  They still do that and do so very professionally.<\/p> <p>  However, more than half their business is now generally in interventions with people self-harming and harming others because of mental health issues.  They have a high level of training and provide a high level of non-lethal intervention in situations that might otherwise get out of control for police officers.  This was something we never did or were never skilled, trained or equipped for.  Ten years on those units are flat-out busy every day of every week at every point on the clock.  It is more than an anecdote; a lot of data sits behind that.  That is just the societal shift with which policing deals.<\/p> <p>  Custody areas have been a revolving door for us.  We see familiar faces in custody - the same people.  When we sit down and talk to those providing healthcare we find they fall into two categories.  They are either frequent attenders at accident and emergency departments and other medical services or they are not on the health service's radar at all but actually have significant health needs.  That is a healthcare and equality issue.<\/p> <p>  We have just put staff into the custody suite for the proof of concept two weeks ago having spent two years working on this.  It is moving from just having the standard forensic medical officer, police doctor, in the custody suite who might confirm that person is fine and is fit for interview, to a nurse-led healthcare arrangement in custody suites.  We are trying to identify why this person is consistently coming in to us; what the healthcare gaps are; and how we can signpost them to healthcare interventions so that they are not rocking up to accident and emergency departments when it gets out of control and they are not getting arrested and brought to the custody suite.  We are trying to break that vicious cycle through a criminal justice and health partnership.  That has been co-funded by the Northern Ireland Departments of Justice and Health.  It has been put into action with 17 new nurses recruited as part of that package from 1 October now completing their training under medical supervision.<\/p> <p>  We are also in conversation with the ambulance service not only in Northern Ireland, but across the UK.  There is co-dependency between ambulance attendants and police attendants at calls.  Frequently the ambulance service is looking for police support to calls because of the nature of what it is dealing with.  Frequently we are getting there and dealing with ambulance calls because the ambulance service is stretched doing other things as well.  Some services and forces in the rest of the United Kingdom are looking at embedding paramedics in police control rooms, and police officers in paramedic control rooms.  It leads us to the question of why we do not just slice the bread before we put it into the bag, and have joint police and ambulance control rooms.  That has been explored in key areas, such is the crossover and co-dependency in this area of work.  That goes back to the changing nature of society and the changing nature of policing that I mentioned in my opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  There are good experiences and good things happening as we explore that way forward in the wider UK.  There has been less traction in Northern Ireland.  I point to the lack of a statutory compulsion to do that.  The work we are doing with our partners at the moment is done on the basis of getting a coalition of the willing to find a solution for these things and that has been useful.  In England and Wales - there is a similar but different situation in Scotland - there is the statutory crime and disorder partnership, which compels statutory agencies to work together to deliver key outcomes for communities and society.  There are particular problem areas.  Scotland uses single-outcome agreements where the parties and the various statutory agencies sign up to deliver their part of the outcome and their contribution to it.  That is a statutory requirement.  That is the same in England and Wales.<\/p> <p>  We attempted to get similar legislation introduced in Northern Ireland in 2011 and 2012.  It fell for reasons which are not important today.  From talking to those in political parties across the spectrum in Northern Ireland I know they recognise we need it.  Particularly at a time of austerity where all parties are under pressure, for politicians and Government to get reassurance that we are doing everything we can in partnership will take some statutory compulsion because it does not happen organically in my experience - certainly not in the way that it needs to give the Government reassurance on behalf of communities and society that we are doing the best we can with it.<\/p> <p>  That looks to the changing nature of partnership dependencies and what we might do differently in future.  I have quoted some of the examples in there.  I am happy to expand on that.  I think that has touched most of what the Deputy has asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>It is incredibly interesting - mind-blowing in some ways.  The committee could definitely consider recommending statutory compulsion.  I have two related questions.  Is the experience similar in the South?  The scale of that issue strongly emphasises the point we dealt with previously regarding treating drugs as a health issue rather than just a crime issue and the interface there.  In reports that have been done in the South in the areas of the review around children being taken into care by garda&iacute; under section 29, the experience was that the garda who dealt with that issue was generally very professional, caring and empathetic.  However, the gap arose in their subsequent interconnection with the other social services and agencies.  Given the training garda&iacute; get, how could we expect a garda to have to deal with that stuff?  If we are talking about moving the police service in that direction, which is happening anyway, where is the specialist training for dealing with all that stuff that really requires medical expertise?  Would the figures in the South be as dramatic as in the North?  What specialist and interagency approach applies there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#J00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I absolutely agree that is a factor of policing now.  We are all dealing with that at the moment.  The level of mental health issues and trauma we are dealing with in the people with whom we engage is becoming really topical.  It was not part of discourse in policing five or ten years ago but it is very much part of it now.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, appeared before the committee earlier.  Members will be aware that he launched the evaluation of the joint agency response to crime, JARC, in recent weeks.  That has been very successful.  It brings An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the Prison service and other agencies together focusing on a certain cohort of criminal activity and the people who are involved in it.  That is all about trying to engineer them out of the criminal justice system and bringing about interventions that would not normally have been available to the police.<\/p> <p>  The central protective services bureau has been operational for quite a while and the divisional model is bringing on the other ones.  They will be in all divisions before too long.  All of that acknowledges that we are not just dealing with criminals; people have a background.  The majority of people who end up in prisons have suffered trauma in childhood and we have never been part of a discourse on that.  However, that is changing substantially now.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of one of those outreach programmes in Dublin city at the moment between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Ana Liffey Drug Project, Dublin City Council and others, where they are going out and looking for these hard to reach people who are not being provided with the full intervention spectrum to address their issues because drugs, homelessness and trauma are all wrapped up in the same individual.<\/p><p>They are going out and finding people in laneways and doorways.  They are trying to create a relationship with them to find out what interventions are being made for them.  Where gaps are found, they try to fast-track them into treatment and through the housing system which, as members are aware, is very difficult.  That has been ongoing for quite a while.  I believe there are 50 people in the city who are part of the programme.  Yes, it is becoming very much part of the lexicon in policing.<\/p><p> I shall give the committee a flavour of the training provided or acquired for community police officers which based on the model that is in place.  Every garda who is encountered on the street, certainly those in uniform, should have received this training as we move into the future.  It starts with ethos, ethics and human rights, decision-making, problem identification, problem solving and vulnerable and trauma impact identification.  This is a new discourse and dialogue in policing.  The training also includes harm prevention, intervention strategies, multi-ethnicity collaboration, victim support, stakeholder analysis and engagement, data management, diversity and integration, hate crime and community roles and responsibilities.  There is also community interaction with minorities and migrants, age positive actions and mental and physical health.  There is a list of aspects that need to be engineered into the police training programme.  This is included in the framework we are presenting to the Garda Commissioner.  It has been acknowledged that it is part and parcel of policing.  The discourse on it has really only come to the fore in the last couple of years.  It is also absolutely reflective of what Mr. Todd is describing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":388,"content":"<p>If the assistant commissioner wants to come back in at any time, he should please just take the initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#K00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I share what has been said.

That is the forum in which we get news out to the local community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>There is a little healthy competition ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#K01000","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>The PSNI figures are double what has been quoted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It is really a case of what someone does with the medium and adds value.  It is a cultural challenge and has been for us.  Pretty much every local neighbourhood team has more followers on social media than the numbers who buy the local newspaper.  That is a fact.  People are more likely, therefore, to get their news and information from a policing perspective through social media than through their local newspaper.  Local newspapers have been trending off, while we have been trending upwards.  That is generally the case in any town across Northern Ireland; there are more people who read our social media feeds than the local newspaper.  To make it work, social media are very much in the moment, relevant and sometimes can be a little edgy.  That is the cultural challenge, something on which we are still working.  The local garda or police officer in the town has to be able to access a social media device and post about stuff that is happening in the area, without centralised control.  That does bring risks.  I do not need to tell politicians about what happens when one gets it wrong on social media.  It is no different for those involved in policing.  You have to trust your people and allow them to do it, accept that they are going to make mistakes from time to time and that you are going to have to apologise when they do.  That is the only way to make it fast, interesting and engaging.  Otherwise there will be all of the people who follow the organisation but do not really engage with it.  While we conduct national campaigns from the centre through our feeds, most of the interaction locally is about day-to-day stuff such as a lost dog, a missing person, a stolen car or a broken window, with the local team and local people engaging in real time.  This is decentralising.  Sir Hugh Orde would have said his model and ethos to enable community policing was maximum devolvement of authority within a corporate framework.  We keep revisiting the corporate framework, but we have never, ever, moved away from empowering local people to do things locally.  Social media make this even more important.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to station closures.  When I was asked about how we took the partnership forward, I spoke about the statutory framework.  In the past 12 to 18 months we have been working with significant success on a concern hub.  It started in Derry-Londonderry.  It is a local multi-agency hub to where the police and partners can take individuals of concern, high demand or high need users, whichever way they come to attention, and people sit around the table and ask: \"How do we fix this?\"  One then realises that while the police has eight pieces of information on the individual, the education people have three pieces, the housing people have four and the health people another five.  When all of the information is put in the one place, solutions start to appear.  We now have five hubs running.  We have not gone right across the province because currently we are reviewing policing, but I believe we should be actively considering what the structure should look like at a local level.  If we are to have local policing, local service delivery and local problem solving, we need a local partnership structure through which they can be delivered.  It needs to be empowered by the partner agencies.  Experience shows that this is effective and usually cost efficient.  We have anecdotal examples from the centres that show that people who used to contact the agencies around 50 or 60 times a year about a range of issues are now finding that their problems have been solved and that they do not have to contact us anymore.  There is a return on investment in that type of approach.  <\/p> <p>  I see the relevance of this approach to the conversation.  As Assistant Commissioner Leahy said, we need to find a way.  If we can devolve authority to that level and our authority as a collective to partnerships and have a local partnership management structure, in which the police will provide a service for every element and do the policing piece in collaboration with partners around the table, it will be much more resource effective and an effective way to do business.  That is the challenge, not only in our own structures but also in how we dovetail  them to make them work collaboratively and in unison with other partners.  The community could then feed its needs into that space.  The accountability structures can be local.  We have police and community safety partnerships that oversee and hold local commanders accountable for performance or other partners that are involved.  It needs to expand into the service delivery space.  We have partnership service delivery and decision-making at the centre of the organisation - as an enabler - to devolve decision-making to that level.  In the first instance, in the Patten report, the ethos within our corporate framework was maximum devolvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>That is some really good information.

That figure is between 3.9 and 8.5 in more rural areas.  The difference is significant.  I do not want rural dwellers to be sitting back in fear of crime to a greater extent than they should be.

Many people in the community take this issue very seriously.  There is probably a perception that our law is not sufficiently severe in how it deals with people who abuse and mistreat animals.

We are improving and communication is taking place.  Perhaps it is the case that we do not deal with these issues until they surface.  I know from some of the exchanges we have had that communications has been a problem in the past.  I think we are enhancing it and getting the message out to our own people that we need to take it seriously.  We need to work with the other agencies.  It is only when we work in that way that we can get really successful outcomes.  We are working closely with various organisations across the country, including the ISPCA.  It is important that such relationships are fostered because they are the key to achieving successful outcomes.  Regardless of whether the social problems we are dealing with involve human beings or animals, my perspective is that the most effective way of achieving success is to work with agencies.  I am not sure whether Mr. Todd has had any difficulties in this area.

My colleague, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, is a UK leader on hate crime.  We think the PSNI is proficient at that but the solutions lie locally.  The strategies and plans can be in place and support can be brought, but it has to be done through local policing solutions.  It is transient in nature.  There are different communities in different places at different times because of employment factors and factories and food production.

That is understandable but it does not make it any easier for people like me and my colleagues to plan for it.<\/p> <p>  It would be fair to summarise what the PSNI has done to date as looking at the range of cross-Border work it currently does and has done over recent times, looking at which of those pieces of work rely on European instruments, legislation or regulations, and trying to work out, if those were lost, how to maintain the current position.  European arrest warrants allow us to bring people from North to South and South to North for offences.  That is well practised and routine.  What would be the position if there were no European arrest warrants?<\/p> <p>  Information sharing is the lifeblood of North-South, UK-wide and Europe-wide operations.  That information sharing, across a range of disciplines, is lifeblood to many policing operations.  Which parts of that and which access to those systems requires European regulation, and what would be needed if we did not have them?  The PSNI is taking account of all those and telling the Department of Justice and other partners that those are where the gaps will be and those need to be filled.  That forms the basis for that plan.<\/p> <p>  There are things that we have control over, like meetings, face-to-face exchanges, secondments from North to South and South to North, the building and maintaining of relationships across the Border, and the joint task force on organised crime.

Shortcomings of ours relating to the incident were identified and we have accepted the report and recommendations.

Our frustration does not stem from being criticised but, rather, that in spite of our best efforts and interventions and taking the person to a place of care, he ultimately took his own life.

If community policing is working and has community engagement, approval and acceptance, it would be almost churlish for policing not to take advantage of that.  It is an opportunity to utilise an important element of the spectrum of responses to combating crime.

Children are falling through the cracks because of service gaps and children and some adults find it hard reach a good space because of them.  We are highly conscious of that in the South also.

If one gives them a problem, they will fix it.  That is in our DNA.  It means that when these problems are thrown at us after 4 p.m. on a Friday through to 10 a.m. on Monday, we will do our level best and apply ourselves to the job of keeping people safe and doing all those things one would expect the police to do.  If we continue to train our people in that space, it will be at the cost of something else.  That is a conversation for the partnerships and the communities on the role of policing and the way it is intended to address this issue as we go forward.  More gaps will develop and the police force can no longer be expected to assume responsibility for managing this space.<\/p> <p>  There will be core things we need to do, and these have changed over time.  Members receive much more training in suicide awareness and suicide intervention and negotiation and problem solving.  That has changed over time as well.  There is much more nuanced use of policing powers in problem solving.  We need the partnership structure to come together in a co-ordinated and collaborative way to bring solutions, rather than having us continue to train more of a declining number of officers using a smaller budget to do things that it is not part of our role to deliver in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  We need to have a training needs analysis to identify the things that police officers can reasonably be expected to do, as part of their core policing role on a day-to-day basis.  There are then specialist roles on top of that.  The road becomes never-ending once we accept that we will be the emergency service of last resort.  To illustrate this point, a national recommendation was made to me, as the UK national lead for contact management, that we train all police call handlers in the UK in first aid because a call handler in a police centre, in an attempt to do the right thing, gave poor first aid advice to a person who suffered additional injury as a result of that advice.  The recommendation was to train every contact management operative and call handler in the UK in first aid.  That is the role of the ambulance service.  It is a question of training our members to recognise what is needed and transfer the call.  If we try to train all officer in everything, we will never succeed.

The public did not lose out on a service but on the comfort that comes from having a local police stations and the sense that there are many police in there to come to their aid if needed, which was never the case, but that is where the sense of security comes from.<\/p> <p>  I have been a decision-maker and have gone to the Northern Ireland Policing Board with recommendations to close and sell off a range of police stations across Northern Ireland based on very sound data.  I think it is the right thing to do when faced with the challenges that face us as an organisation.  Otherwise I would not have recommended it.  I still understand the confidence local communities have from having them but I could not sit here today and put in front of anyone a business case to build more that would withstand scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Todd.

It is a big challenge for us to provide the level of service that we would like to give to policing when so much of our time is taken up by what I would not describe as core policing demands but as matters that fall to the police to deal with, especially at weekends when we are stretched and have the least resources to help us.  It is a challenge for us.

The Deputy is referring to section 12, where a garda is empowered to act if a child is at risk.  He is right that Dr. Shannon, when he came in, said that garda&iacute; acted very professionally in this role.  Much of that came from on-the-job training and experience that people picked up along the way from other members.  With regard to full-on training, garda&iacute; would have been trained on the Act itself and understanding what it meant, but with regard getting into the mindset and going in to do an evaluation in a home situation to determine whether a person is at risk, much of that over the years has been based on a member&rsquo;s perceptions and what he or she feels, sees and picks up in the environment he or she is in.  Dr. Shannon found that we applied that very well and in a very sensitive way.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Todd is right that for every issue or incident that arises for policing there is a call for additional training.  The spectrum is jammed full at the moment, both here and, as Mr. Todd describes, in the North.  The bottom line is that for everything one trains for, something else falls off the far side, as it were.  One can only take on so many of the roles that other agencies are more experienced at.  Mr. Todd is right when he says that when we get into that space, we start creating a risk for ourselves and for others in many cases.  We are changing the nature of the game in policing ourselves, and as I went through the list of training for community garda&iacute; and what they will be exposed to, they are taking training on trauma, mental health and such areas that would not have been on the floor, so to speak, for policing.  It would have been a traditional approach to policing.  The environment has changed quite considerably for us and training will change accordingly.<\/p> <p>  Going back to how it should be addressed, the joint agency response to crime is the way forward.  Mr. Todd hinted at it with regard to the PSNI, where we are operating with other agencies that have the capacity and expertise to deliver services that we cannot instead of training police to do it.  When we talk about the joint agency response to crime, we are talking about having appropriate agencies working together to provide unified, integrated services to people whom it is not appropriate for police to service on their own.  That will require some significant changes because the Deputy is right that, in certain circumstances, some agencies work from Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and I have worked at the coalface in and around Pearse Street and Store Street for many years, as a sergeant, inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent, where people present themselves at all hours of the day and night over the weekends.  We try to operate the out-of-hours system and we have children and young people looking for a place to stay, but it ends up at a garda's front door.  We need to move out of that system when addressing that type of issue.  This is a constant situation for policing across Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK in general.  We are all dealing with the same issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Mr. Todd said that funding for policing is a political choice, which is a very strong statement.

Given that we have closed so many of the stations in the south, do the witnesses think they can do that as well as they would like with the current resources?

One of the difficulties we all experienced in the past when the numbers dropped was that in order to provide 24-7 cover in the main centres, we sucked garda&iacute; in from the outside stations to backfill.  Communities in rural areas where some of the smaller stations are located probably suffered most.  Given that the numbers are coming back up due to the increase in Garda personnel, we now have an opportunity to put garda&iacute; back into communities and leave them there to focus on engaging with people and dealing with local issues.  It was not a mistake because we had no option at the time but to bring in garda&iacute; to keep patrol cars going on a 24-7 basis.  Now we have that option and that is what we are looking at in terms of the new policing model.  We can start to backfill positions in those communities and those involved will become the local community garda&iacute; in Deputy Wallace's area and in other areas.  That is what communities want.  They want to know the local garda and to know he is there to help them solve local problems.  From my experience, that is the type of presence a lot of communities in rural areas want.  That is the reason they were most critical of us in the past when we sucked the resources into the main urban centres.  Even if a station remained, it was not open because there was no garda there to open it as he or she was in the local town driving a patrol car and providing a service in the bigger area.  We have an opportunity to deal with the issue now and that will be part of our philosophy going forward in terms of getting our resources back up.  That type of community policing is what people in rural areas, especially where I come from, want to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Finn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":475,"content":"<p>In terms of the actual structure that is proposed - we will go back to what we talked about earlier in terms of the use of technology - we are proposing that every division will have a community support office or divisional community policing office that will be contactable by any means.  They will be the orchestrators of community policing in the sense that every division and district in the country will be broken down and mapped so that somebody owns every segment of it.  In a rural area a person may be required to have a bicycle or a car and additional resources are required for that, but he or she will own a particular area as an individual and will be held accountable and responsible for that, but people will also be part of a broader team for a wider area.  We can call it a sector or whatever else is agreed.  Every part of the country should be covered by the community policing initiative.  People will know who their community garda is, but he or she will be part of a team so even if he or she has a day off, somebody on the team will pick up the slack.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace referred to resources.  In a rural area where the community policing area could be 25 sq. km, a vehicle will be required and we will include that in the cost of introducing a community policing model that has a proper structure and that the practices we employ are effective.  That is an example of some of the structures that will be put in place and potentially relates to the 80% of non-crime issues we normally deal with.  It is not emergency response but relates to problem solving in communities and it must happen day in and day out.  It is not a question of having days of action, it is a constant approach to engaging with communities, determining what the needs are and developing unique responses to them.<\/p> <p>  The concept of community has changed considerably in the past two or three decades and people are operating almost like customers.  People come together as a community but they also come separately.  One has to get beyond the broad brushstroke of community and have a unique response to the customer base that is out there, for example, Mrs. Leahy and Mrs. Murphy who have a very different requirement to the group.  It is not an easy task but I am prepared to come back to the committee at some stage and go into the challenges associated with community policing and give an indication of how it has been implemented elsewhere, what failures have been encountered, and the challenges presented.  It changes the nature of the game for policing.  Generally, we all operate to a traditional command-and-control response system.  Despite the fact that we have had real successes with community policing, we have not had a national model.  In 2015, we were given an award for European best practice in community policing.  We were also nominated that years as one of three areas in Europe for the European public sector excellence award in community policing.  We have an understanding and knowledge of how to introduce community policing in a microcosm but it is a challenge to do it on a national scale where one delivers a consistent approach to delivering a community-oriented policing service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>To the best of my knowledge, approximately 65% of the prison population have mental health issues.

It is incredibly challenging for the Garda to be able to link with the services in what Mr. Todd calls the local partnership structure.  That will require a lot of work to help more people, especially young people, to stay out of prison and stay out of trouble.  Co-operation is required with other service providers.  However, so many of the services leave so much to be desired.  I refer, for example, to the mental health services in Wexford, which have been severely criticised.  They are not nearly good enough.  Mr. Leahy spoke about housing earlier.  No one can expect the Garda to find housing for people who are in need because the Government cannot find them at the moment.  There is insufficient housing for people who are in emergency housing situations in the country today for various reasons.  Mr. Todd referred to local partnership structures.

We have experimented with that recently in respect of the joint agency response to crime, JARC.  What is emerging from that process is that having the agencies working together is the way to go.

Some of what is helping keep the representation up is that the people retiring are disproportionately from the Protestant community.  Therefore, when there is better representation recruited and a high number of people from the Protestant community retiring, the balance of the organisation tends to stay where it has been.  Ideally we would like to see in a straw poll that 45% of all our new student officers are from the Roman Catholic community, but because we have not reached that and the long-term trend may come under pressure, that is a strategic concern.

We do not make any distinction between the background of officers and the areas they police except where there is a concern in a town they come from.  Then we tend not to send them to the town because of the problems that brings.  Ironically that flies in the face of community policing because, in a perfect world, a young Gael who comes from County Tyrone, plays in the local GAA club, has gone to the local school and joins the police service would be back delivering a policing service to that community.

To that extent there is.<\/p> <p>  Apart from the prison service, to respond to Assistant Commissioner Leahy's point and the Deputy's last question, that joining up of services and agencies was probably best done at a senior strategic and central level.  The challenge for the work on community policing is how to make those joined-up services available to local practitioners and cops.  The waiting time for referral for heroin addiction in Belfast can be 18 to 20 weeks.  Sometimes it goes beyond that, depending on the waiting lists in the health service.  If there is a police officer in a town dealing with an individual who is breaking into houses or cars or stealing from shops to feed their addiction, society's solution should at least include some treatment to remove the causative factor in heroin addiction from that person.  If the person has to wait 20 weeks for treatment and the system does not work, they end up in the custody suite, court and prison, which goes back to the Deputy's earlier point.  When the local police officer dealing with the problem, using all the skills we have given him or her, identifies the problem, the culprit and a potential solution which requires partnership, how does that police officer use that local knowledge to get a response as opposed to a document signed off between departments headquartered some distance from the officer working on the ground?  When I talk about local partnership delivery systems, that is where it has to be joined up.  The prison service has a role to play in that, perhaps not a major one but that is a challenge.  Communities are telling the cops what the problems are.  We know what the underlying problems are and the long-term solutions, but then what?  If we cannot get the long-term solution, we end up arresting the culprits, processing them, putting them before the courts and locking them up.

There is work to be done in that regard but that change brought the issue to the fore.  As I said, the issue is being explored.  I am not sure how quickly we will reach decision mode around this.

I apologise that I had to step out for a moment but the parts of the meeting I was here for made for a very interesting discussion.  The first issue I wanted to picked up on is local accountability mechanisms.  It is an element of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I will first direct some questions on structures in place in the North to Assistant Chief Constable Todd.  I understand the policing and community safety partnerships, PCSPs, are more advanced and robust than the joint policing committees, JPCs, in the South.  Will Assistant Chief Constable Todd give us a general sense of what a typical PCSP meeting involves?  What are the general functions of these partnerships and how effective are they?  How much community buy-in exists in the different communities?<\/p> <p>  I also have questions for the two lads from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In terms of the JPCs and the policing fora, it is not immediately clear to me from the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland's report what the division of labour between the two will be in future.  In my experience, the community fora are much more effective and there is much more community interest in them.  The JPCs can often amount to information sessions for members of local authorities.  That is the responsibility of local authority members and Oireachtas Members too as they often do no more than ask questions.  Nonetheless, there is more meaty engagement and, if is not quite the case that more formal decisions are taken, there is at least more general agreement to action things at the policing fora.  There seems to be more of a focus on that in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland but I am not entirely clear on what a JPC should do as of now.  I would welcome observations from the representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on how either of these two accountability mechanisms could be strengthened. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#S00700","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Post the Patten commission, the original structures were called district policing partnerships.  There was one district policing partnership in each of the policing districts, which are coterminous with the council areas in Northern Ireland.  Local authority areas are coterminous with policing and district policing partnerships in order to maintain accountability.  That role changed over time.  A number of partners and functions were merged, through the councils, into policing and community safety partnerships but the ethos remains the same.  It is a slight play on language.  They sit under the auspices and governance of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which is analogous to the Policing Authority here.  They are managed, supported and funded through that structure.  While the policing board holds the Chief Constable accountable for the performance of the police service, the language around policing and community safety partnerships is that they monitor local performance but there is actually an accountability framework, or at least we treat it that way, which errs on the side of more rather than less accountability.<\/p> <p>  Typically the meetings would begin with the local police commander and some of his or her team providing an update on performance against the local policing plan.  Having a local policing plan which sits under the umbrella of the Northern Ireland Policing Board's policing plan for Northern Ireland is another function of the policing and community safety partnership.  That is designed to give that body, in dialogue with the local commander, a say in the policing priorities for the local district within a wider framework over the next year.  The commanders use those meetings to report back on how they are performing against that plan, on what is working and on what is not working, and on anything that has changed in the meantime. <\/p> <p>  There is then a general discussion forum for any other policing issues of the day.  That might include signal crimes, incidents, developing trends and that sort of thing.  As the Deputy might imagine given this morning's conversation, that conversation often wanders off into determinations that certain issues will be a matter for the council or one or other department.  Very few problems have one answer from one place.  That experience is probably foremost in my mind when I see what the likely future for that structure is.  I think we should retain that local planning because legislation in the North has introduced the concept of community planning.  The local councils are involved in community plans, of which policing and policing plans are aspects.  However, if one takes community planning, local accountability and partnership working, that seems to be a rich space for a true police and community safety partnership on which all the relevant agencies would sit and take a holistic view of the problems in the area and how they can be influenced holistically by local service delivery.<\/p><p>That is where it has to go to.  That is the current structure and its current format.  The important parts from my perspective is that it has helped to change the culture down through the years.  Accountability has gone from being viewed as a novel idea to being part of the air that one breathes.  Accountability is a complete non-contentious matter and it is what one expects to do as a local commander.  As a commander, in the districts I have run I use the cultural change opportunity to take my local sergeants down to those meetings.  If we are truly into local neighbourhood policing, run by the local team, under the local sergeant, then who better to hear what the public is saying and to respond in terms of what the police are doing one the ground, without any filtering by the senior manager such as me, than the local sergeant and local inspector on those teams?  I used that process quite deliberately to try to build that relationship.  We talk about maximum devolvement of decision making.  I believe in devolving the accountability as well.  I actually believe the local TD, MLA, MP or local representative should be able to ring up the local sergeant.  If they ring me, I will only ring the sergeant anyway and give him or her my version of what I heard on the phone.  The local relationship is germane to local policing, local understanding and local relationship building.  That is what we have done, almost as a collateral benefit to that structure.  That is a bit like social media, letting go the control and letting that happen at that level.  As a senior manager, I am acting as an enabler and putting a wrap around to it, so that one gets flagged on critical issues with which the local team needs support or what is happening in the area.  <\/p><p> Accountability works on a number of levels.  There is more we could do with it, as I have outlined further this morning.  That is my rationale behind it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Todd.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#T00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>In the context of the structure of the joint policing committee, JPC, versus the local community fora, what Mr. Todd has said echoes my experience on the ground.  The joint policing committee was a very formal structure and it played its role, but real service was delivered down in the local fora, because the local sergeant and the local superintendent met the local community and that is where the real local needs came out.  There was accountability in that system because the garda&iacute; had to come back the following week and were asked about the particular problem which the community had put on the table that needed to be resolved.  The local fora gave a much better service to the community at local level in terms of solving the problems.  I would certainly love to have more agencies involved.

I do not want to pre-empt the recent evaluation of JPCs by the Policing Authority.  It boils down to relationships and having a dynamic approach to it and the current system is not dynamic.  If one is meeting once a quarter as a member of forum, a great deal of water has gone under the bridge in between meetings.  What we are proposing in terms of community policing structure, and we have experienced this, is that it be dynamic; then there are no surprises when one goes to the JPC because one has dealt with it all full on.  The Garda management knows what is going on, the local representatives know what is going on and the local authority knows what is happening because they are working on it day in and day out; the actual committee becomes a committee.  When I was posted to the north inner city and was involved in a JPC I never felt that I was being held accountable any more; as a committee it was our responsibility to deal with the issues and that was the way we approached it, but that came about because we were not lining up a list of issues at a quarterly meeting.  This was very dynamic engagement and communication between the local representatives, DCC and the Garda and we were working on the issues day by day.  There were no surprises when we got in.  We were right up to date with it.  That is the place we need to go and the model we are proposing will inject that dynamism when day in and day out we are dealing with problems.  It is not something we are waiting to get a list on, whether it be from a community policing forum or from the JPC every three months.

If there are to be two structures, the joint policing committee, JPC and the community fora, there is a need for more definition of what are their respective functions.  There could be an element of replication or the JPC could become a formal box ticking exercise.  That is not necessarily just the responsibility of the Garda; it is also the responsibility of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the legislation and what follows from it.<\/p> <p>  A major element of the model of community policing that existed in this jurisdiction has been the designated community garda.  The number of designated community garda&iacute; has fallen substantially, in the order of 37% since 2010.  It has fallen further in some districts, for example the fall in the number of community garda&iacute; in Donegal and in some of the Dublin districts was particularly large.  The decrease in numbers in other areas was not quite as dramatic.  The proposal in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is that every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be a community garda.  I maintain an open mind but I would have some reservations.  My concern would be that yes, every garda should be community focused and orientated and conscious of the needs of the community and being responsive to it, but if one does not have a dedicated community garda whose primary focus and responsibility is developing relationships with the community, instead of 10% of the Garda whose primary responsibility is to community policing one will have 100% of the Garda for whom 10% of their responsibility is community policing.  If every garda is a community garda, when there is a spike in crime in a particular area or a public order issue, or at the time of year when there are lots of events, do members of the Garda get moved off that intensive community policing work into fire-fighting whatever particular issues arise at a moment in time?  Dr. Johnny Connolly from the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was before the committee last week and he said that where the community policing model worked well, people knew who their local community garda was and he or she was the person they knew to seek out in the station, or the person to contact about the community bus or other useful information.<\/p> <p>  From the perspective of Northern Ireland and the South, do the witnesses have a view on the model that every police officer or garda is responsible or that there is a need for dedicated community garda&iacute;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#T00700","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised a really interesting point.  Unfortunately when one determines that everybody in the district is a community garda, that has been the greatest escape hatch for the traditional model since policing began where everybody is a community garda but nobody is.<\/p><p>That is not what the commission had in mind.  I engaged with members of the commission before this meeting, including Johnny Connolly, and I have had discussions to try to find out what exactly they had in mind.  They come out in the commission report and say there is a stratified set of qualities and skills required, and that these will differ.  While they highlight that, the Deputy is right, however, that we need to know what the dedicated community garda actually is.  The first responders will have a different skill set but they must have a community policing ethos, so there is a certain level of training they must undergo.  Similarly, detectives in drugs units must all be indoctrinated into the ethos of being community-centric.  A certain skill set is required for that foundation community policing cohort.<\/p><p> We are suggesting that a community garda is determined to be such if he or she is spending 60% or more of his or her time dedicated to community policing.  We all know that, for a major protest or major event, it is all shoulders to the wheel in policing.  That is the nature of the game.  It is what the public would expect and what we ourselves expect.  This is the definition we are proposing, namely, they would spend 60% or more of their time dedicated to problem-solving in the community and they would be associated with a particular well-defined area so that everyone in the area would know this was the community garda and that this was the person to call when in trouble.<\/p><p> To manage a situation like that nationally or even on a district basis, there must be a hub and someone must the conductor of all of this.  That is why we are suggesting there will be a divisional community policing office that manages all of the data around this and tasks, for example, Pat Leahy, the community garda on the ground, because Mrs. Murphy is saying she has an issue.  She is now Pat Leahy's constituent, and he is responsible for minding that person and making sure the problem is solved.  If the garda needs to leverage resources to come in and assist, such as a detective unit, a drugs unit or a traffic unit, the system should facilitate that very effectively.<\/p><p> That is probably what is most appropriate in this respect.  It is a concept that has created a conversation around this because it has in the past presented the escape hatch for policing to say they are there already and no change is required.  I can be categorical, from talking to members of the commission, that that is not what they have in mind.  They have a paradigm shift in mind in that we need to go back to the drawing board and reconstitute our approach to community policing.  They are unambiguous and very strong about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Would the Assistant Chief Constable like to offer an additional view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#U00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I am very much in the same place.  I do not think we can ever achieve the \"Every officer is a community officer\" place.  In many ways, it would be folly to try, although it has been used as a bit of a panacea in the past.  I agree with Assistant Commissioner Leahy that it is about the mindset, ethos and skills.  That is the way our policing in the community project has approached this, namely, through cross-cutting values and skills and approaches across the business area.  If one needs to get the community focus at the front end of operations, the specialists work through the local neighbourhood sergeant and local neighbourhood team.  The community impact assessment and the advice from the local sergeant tailors what that operation ends up looking like because everyone understands they are there to solve problems on behalf of the community, and they do not want to create problems by not being thoughtful or not being consultative and collaborative around it.  Those are the working practices that come out of this.<\/p> <p>  I would say our detectives and specialist units that support the local police in those operations have a community policing mindset and an understanding of this area.  They have almost a second nature and they understand why they are there, working through local cops as opposed to just being a specialist unit that arrives in town for the day and disappears tomorrow.  That is the shift that is required in order that everyone will have that mindset and ethos.  When we talk about the national decision-making model in the UK, people will take us round the various steps of it but what they often forget is that sitting in the middle of the model and the touchstone for each element of it are values and community policing behaviours.

We now have the Department on side and the Minister opened the evaluation; therefore, we are getting into that head space across the spectrum of agencies.

Sometimes, there is an anti-social behaviour or criminal element to what is happening, but the congregating is often benign.  There is a mixture.  It seems that many of these issues are arising because of the lack of investment in youth facilities.  Particularly if they are not into sport, there is nowhere for young people in the 13 to 17 years age bracket to go.

It has been an emerging trend for us.  Whether issues such as this have to do with a lack of facilities is a conversation people have been having for as long as I remember.  We have not yet solved the problem.  The position varies from area to area.  With an ageing population, people have a different perception of three or four young people on a street corner and can make calls to the police.

Great efforts are being made, but engaging with young people of that age is a major challenge for us.  They are beginning to have thought processes of their own and making their own decisions.  I do not mean to be facetious, but it was Mark Twain who said that, when he was in his teens, he thought his father knew nothing about anything but that, once he had hit his mid-20s, he was surprised by how much his father had learned in such a short time.

Mr. Todd's response to the inquiry about Brexit echoed almost verbatim what I received last week from the executive director of Europol.  I am part of the 28-member joint policing scrutiny group across the European Union.  I put the question to the new executive director, Ms Catherine De Bolle.  I listened carefully to Mr. Todd and thought to myself that his reply was almost exactly the same.  Even on the bigger stage, the situation is no different than from what it is on our own small island.<\/p> <p>  I am a Border Deputy and also a proud Ulster man.  Cross-Border crime presents in a number of ways.  It does not affect the agricultural community only.  I commend the PSNI.  In recent days I noted that there had been a significant retrieval of stolen goods north of the Border that the news reports indicated had all been stolen south of the Border.  It is not something on which Mr. Todd can comment because it is probably in the judicial realm, but it is indicative of the level of cross-Border co-operation and the good work being done on the ground.  In that regard, I should also commend Mr. Todd's colleagues in the Garda.<\/p> <p>  I noticed in the statistics Mr. Leahy cited that there had been a considerable reduction in the level of rustling.  It was once a significant issue, certainly in Cavan-Monaghan.  While it did not all make its way north of the Border, there was a strong sense or suspicion and a suggestion in public discourse that it did.<\/p> <p>  All of these issues are of great concern within the Border region.  We can only take solace from the fact that we will see an increase in community policing south of the Border as a result of the significantly improved throughput at the Garda College in Templemore.  We will unquestionably receive our share.  On the situation north of the Border, is Mr. Todd anticipating an intensified recruitment drive?  Is it something that is in the offing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#W00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539158400,"counter":544,"content":"<p>No.  In the absence of the Executive, we are in the unfortunate position of having to work with a year-by-year budget.

There is no prospect of a substantial uplift in police officer numbers.  In fact, the pressure is always downwards.  Depending on what Brexit and policing requirements look like, there will be questions about whether there is a need for resources.  While the questions have been asked, no promises have been given.  In the short term, it is a reasonable proposition to seek to increase the level of student officer recruitment as a contingency measure in the context of what Brexit might look like, but such is the attrition rate in the organisation owing to the number of officers retiring that, if we were to stop recruiting, we would come straight back to the numbers we now have and it would not serve to increase the size of the organisation significantly.<\/p><p>The short answer is \"No\", but there is a wider context to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101000002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Todd","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539158400,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I would hope that Brexit is not the prompt that results in additional resourcing; I hope it is for other, better reasons in terms of everything else we have discussed today.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the assembly and Mr. Todd's reference earlier to statutory compulsion, my colleagues have picked up on that and it is very important and useful information.

We need to look into and beyond the statistics.  There are questions to be asked.  I am only giving an example showing how the statistics can change without it meaning that the situation has changed.  In respect of sexual assaults, we are doing everything we can to make it easier for people to report in that space.  That is what we want.

Now we have changed it in the interests of improving our data, so that it is not until someone is summonsed to court that the detection is claimed.  This year, our detections dropped because of that lag.  It is only when the cases come to court now that a detection will be claimed.  That has impacted on our detection statistics for the first half of this year.  It will probably be March of next year, when we will have had 12 months of the new statistics, that we will see it beginning to level out and come back to normal.
