It is a means-assessed payment.  It will be paid for 28 weeks to an estimated 370,000 households across the country.  Last winter a total of 16,284 households across Tipperary received fuel allowance through the scheme and they will automatically receive payments again this year, beginning yesterday.  The scheme plays a vital role in ensuring families across my county of Tipperary have the security of knowing they will be able to pay their heating bills over the winter months.  It will be especially important to people this year in the context of rising fuel costs globally.  I encourage the Minister of State to factor this into account in the upcoming budget.  In fairness the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, increased the weekly rate of payment by &euro;3.50 in last year's budget.  Over the last year, we have witnessed record increases in the prices of wholesale gas, coal, oil and carbon on European markets.  Wholesale prices have rebounded since economies have started to recover from the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In addition, energy markets have experienced declining UK and European natural gas production and a reduction in gas supplies from Russia and the US have also contributed to record price increases.<\/p><p>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, has said that the electricity supply to Ireland will be tight for the next three to four years and that the big data centres which use an enormous amount of energy could not expect to be exempt from the national requirement to conserve energy in order to meet climate change commitments.  There are also concerns that Ireland's electricity generating capacity could deter multinationals from investing in infrastructure such as data centres in Ireland.  A piece by John Mulligan in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>warned of just that.  According to one source: &quot;For the data centre sector, for any multinational investing in Ireland, they look immediately in terms of sites, at the availability of power, the availability of water and the availability of very robust data connections.&quot;  The article noted, &quot;Ireland is home to major data centres for multinationals including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft... A number of amber alerts have occurred in recent weeks, where electricity generators have been warned that any unexpected event could result in a failure to meet demand.&quot;  The sustained rise in demand from such centres, which are energy intensive buildings that house computer systems for storing Internet and business data, was the same as adding 140,000 new households to the network in each of the last four years.  EirGrid, the semi-State company that manages Ireland's electricity grid, has acknowledged that maintaining the balance between supply and demand has become increasingly challenging. <\/p><p>The problem is not going to go away and clearly going to get progressively worse.  There could be rolling blackouts if steps are not taken to curb new centres.  Has the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Ryan, been assured that the two power plants which have been offline for the last number of months will be back online for the winter period?  The expected new data centres will be required to install on their own emergency generation as a condition of gaining a connection to the grid.  EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will publish capacity statements this week with their paths to manage demand.  What does the Minister want to see in those statements to reassure him that we will not have power outages over the winter months?<\/p><p>Fuel allowance is means tested and there are some simple changes we could make in this year's budget to help the most vulnerable get through the winter months with the costs.  The fuel allowance is based on age, income and social welfare payments.  I give the example of a couple that contacted me recently.  They were claiming a pension and she was on half-rate carer's allowance.  Their income was &euro;601 a week.  Their cut-off was &euro;575.  They pay &euro;140 on health insurance and the husband has dementia.  If the means test was to rise for those claiming pensions, particularly those who also claim carer's allowance, it would dramatically help people of pensionable age.  Fuel allowance is also a factor in eligibility for the warmer homes scheme.  Many people of a pensionable age live in older homes with substandard insulation.  Grants such as these would protect these homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#C00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator Ahearn for raising these important matters.  Government fully accepts that recent electricity and gas price increases will not be welcomed in light of the current economic environment.  Increases to wholesale energy prices following rises in international gas prices have been the principal driver of these increases which have been impacting across Europe and are not just an Irish phenomenon.<\/p> <p>First, it is important to recognise that these are not Government decisions.  Price regulation ended many years ago.  Suppliers compete with each other on prices and set their own prices accordingly, as you would expect in a liberalised market.  Second, the independent regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has functions in relation to these matters, including consumer protection and monitoring the market more generally.<\/p> <p>Third, I will set out the long-standing policy on promoting competition in respect of these markets, and what Government is doing in regard to providing significant supports for household energy costs, both in terms of energy efficiency and welfare supports.<\/p> <p>The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the upward trend in international gas prices.  In Europe wholesale natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2020.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.  To protect the most vulnerable, Government provides extensive supports for household energy costs via welfare schemes.  Overall the Government envisages expenditure in excess of &euro;700 million in 2021 on a number of measures to support households in meeting their energy costs.  There are, for example, specific schemes aimed at those at risk of energy poverty, including the household benefits package and the fuel allowance.  In addition, all the funds raised by increases in the carbon tax will be ring-fenced to protect those most exposed to higher fuel and energy costs.  The best long long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy and expand interconnection with European and neighbouring markets.<\/p> <p>Turning to security of supply, the CRU also has statutory responsibility to monitor and take measures necessary to ensure the security of electricity supply in Ireland.  It is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the electricity transmission system.  The CRU has advised that it has identified specific challenges to ensuring electricity security of supply, which it is currently in the process of addressing.  These challenges include lower than expected availability of some existing power stations; anticipated new power stations not being developed as planned; expected growth in demand for electricity, including due to the growth of data centres; and the expected closure of power stations that make up approximately 25% of conventional electricity generation capacity over the coming years.<\/p> <p>A range of actions are being taken by the CRU and EirGrid to ensure security of electricity supply over the coming winter and the years ahead.  The actions they are progressing include maximising the availability of future generation; developing new generation capacity, including temporary generation capacity in advance of winter 2022; making changes to the grid connection rules for data centres; and working with large energy consumers in order to, where possible, reduce their electricity demand during peak periods.<\/p> <p>The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications continues to work closely with the CRU and EirGrid to ensure security of electricity supply and minimise the risk of power cuts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#D00100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Smyth, for his response.

This is not my first time raising energy poverty in this House.  I published a report earlier this year that detailed real lived experiences of people who are living in energy poverty.  The latest figures suggest that 2,800 excess deaths a year are due to cold weather.  Other people are sacrificing other essential items just to keep the lights on and their houses warm.<\/p><p>My first question for the Minister of State is on the energy poverty strategy, which lapsed in 2019.  We have yet to see a new strategy, so there does not seem to be any urgency in this Government about addressing energy poverty.  While the rising cost of energy this year is happening on a global scale, that does not mean that we can take a <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach to how we address energy poverty.  We must have a strategy that identifies which households are most in need of action, and on how we will address those households to ensure we can lift them out of energy poverty.<\/p><p>We know from a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform report in 2020 that we do not have adequate data about energy poverty.  A report in 2015 that was commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications stated that energy poverty in Ireland could be anything from 25% of households, and up to 50% of households in the north west of the country because of one-off housing that relies on solid fuels.  However, the report in 2020 - five years after the 2015 report - shows that we still do not have adequate data to identify those households in energy poverty.  Yet, the Government is dead set on increasing the carbon tax.  It is going to introduce a nationwide smoky fuel ban, which of course we need.  However, if we do not know which households will be directly impacted by those rising costs and by that smoky fuel ban, then how are we going to help those households?<\/p><p>Of course, any increases in the budget in terms of social welfare transfers are to be welcomed.  However, we also need direct State intervention to identify the households and to reduce the cost of energy.  It is regrettable that the Government and the CRU have told people to shop around when they did not take account of how hard it is for people to do that.  Some people do not have the capacity to shop around.  They might not have a credit rating that allows them to do that.  Those households that struggle to make ends meet are advised to go on pay-as-you-go metering, which has a higher tariff, so they are being punished for not having adequate income to cover their bills.<\/p><p>One of the things the Government should be looking at is increasing the doors and window fund to make it easier for local authorities to identity those households.  That would be a short-term stopgap to make those homes warmer for people and it would reduce their energy costs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The other aspect concerns the PSO levy.  It exists to subsidise renewable energy but it is calculated on the basis of peak demand usage.  That allows data centres off the hook when it comes to paying their fair share of the PSO levy.  Data centres do not have high peak demands.  Instead, they have a steady demand during the day.  Households are therefore subsidising the PSO levy on behalf of data centres.  The Government could do something to address this issue directly by adjusting the PSO levy and making it apply to demand usage and not peak demand usage.  That could be done overnight.  Those are two measures that could be taken.  I also ask the Minister of State to advise me regarding when we are going to see indicators from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to allow for the proper identification of those households most in need in respect of energy poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#E00500","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan.  This is an important issue.  Energy poverty is influenced by people's income, the energy efficiency of their home and the cost of the energy they use in their home.  Government policy, therefore, focuses on supplementing lower-income households through the fuel allowance and other payments, as well as by providing free energy efficiency upgrades via the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, schemes and the social housing retrofitting programme.<\/p> <p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy to combat energy poverty was published in 2016 and it is being reviewed at present.  Since the publication of the strategy, good progress has been made to alleviate the burden of energy poverty on the most vulnerable in society.  I will detail some of the achievements in that regard.  The share of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty has reduced from 28% in 2016 to 17.5% in 2020.  The proportion of people reporting that they are unable to afford to keep their home adequately warm has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.9% in 2019.  The funding provided for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically from &euro;15 million in 2015 to more than &euro;109 million in 2021.  The fuel allowance has also increased from &euro;20 per week in 2014 to &euro;28 per week in 2021, and it is paid to people receiving long-term social welfare payments, including pensioners, people with disabilities, those parenting alone and jobseekers.  The allocation for the retrofitting of social housing has increased, with &euro;65 million allocated for 2021.  Free upgrades were carried out in more than 24,000 lower-income homes under the main SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes.  In addition, the Housing for All strategy has committed to introducing additional rent controls that will result in rental properties having a required minimum building energy rating, BER.<\/p> <p>Energy efficiency measures are central to addressing one of the root causes of energy poverty.  Since 2018, the level of retrofitting under the SEAI schemes has increased from an average value of &euro;3,000 per home to &euro;17,100 per home.  This means that those households are more protected from changes in their income or energy costs.  The fuel allowance is provided to an estimated 370,000 households across the State.  A budget of &euro;292 million has been set aside for the upcoming season.  A household benefits package is also available to eligible households and can be used towards meeting the cost of electricity or gas bills.  The Department of Social Protection also funds an exceptional needs payment, which can in some cases include support with fuel bills.<\/p> <p>Responsibility for the regulation of Irish electricity and gas markets is a matter for the CRU.  Protections are in place for those falling into difficulties with their energy bills and suppliers will not disconnect customers who engage with them.  The programme for Government and the climate action plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a BER rating of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next decade.  A new national retrofit plan will be published in quarter four of this year and the plan is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas, namely, customer proposition, demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity and governance.  <\/p> <p>The programme for Government has committed to ensuring that the retrofit programme is socially progressive, with a focus on lower-income households.  This commitment will not only help in reducing our carbon emissions, but also, more importantly, benefit lower-income householders in many ways.  Homes will be warmer, easier to heat and more comfortable and will also support improved occupant health and well-being, especially among vulnerable groups.  The retrofit programme will also stimulate employment generation in what is a highly labour-intensive sector, with the potential to create high-quality sustainable jobs in local communities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#F00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that update.

This is particularly so from a County Clare perspective given the late Laura Brennan was from Ennis.  She did so much in her campaigning to encourage both parents and young people to take up the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine.  At one stage take-up was in excess of 80%, which is remarkable, even from a European or worldwide perspective.  As we move forward through the pandemic, we see vaccine hesitancy in the country is very low by international standards.  We have take-up of well over 90% in the Covid-19 vaccination programme.  I want to see us achieve 90% take-up in the HPV vaccination programme because it does save lives.  As Laura Brennan said on a regular basis, this is the one vaccine that will save lives.  It is proven, tried and tested.  The research and the facts speak for themselves.  Obviously the programme has suffered an interruption due to Covid-19 and schools being closed, as well as the difficulties and challenges associated with that.  Nobody can blame anybody for that.  That is just the way it was.  There was a public health emergency and unfortunately, a lot of healthcare suffered, including the HPV vaccine roll-out.<\/p> <p>I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State on the update I have sought.

I have raised this matter before.  I would like to know if any of the vaccination centres have been used.  If so, I ask for some detail on that.  If not, are there plans to use the vaccination centres, especially in areas in which there is a lower take-up of the HPV vaccine than we would like?  Clearly, we want 100% of people to take it up, but if there are parts of the country in which the take-up is lower than in others, maybe we need to look at other interventions, such as using the vaccination centres.<\/p><p>The HPV vaccine catch-up programme has come to my attention on a number of occasions.  People throughout the country have heard me raising the issue and have contacted me.  If parents decide not to go ahead with the vaccine because they are hesitant, concerned or fearful and then change their minds after six or 12 months, they have to pay a &euro;600 fee to get the vaccine from their GP.  We should not be punishing people who decide, albeit late, that they want to do what is right in the interest of their children's health.  Can the Minister of State give a commitment that we will waive that &euro;600 fee?  If we got that out of this debate, it would be a major achievement and would certainly help in increasing the uptake of the HPV vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#G00400","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this matter.  We have spoken about it previously and I fully agree with everything he has said.<\/p> <p>I will address the Senator's concerns under the three categories he raised, namely, the plan, the vaccination centres and the costings.  In 2009, the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, recommended the HPV vaccination for all 12 and 13-year-old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of secondary school.<\/p> <p>In 2013, NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should be given to boys.  On foot of NIAC's recommendation, my Department asked HIQA to undertake a health technology assessment, HTA, to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in their first year of secondary school.  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, which recommended the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys in their first year of secondary school.<\/p> <p>A policy decision was made to expand the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of the 9-valent HPV vaccine.  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in immunisation schedules are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against the vaccine.  It is important to note that for the 2019-20 academic year, the uptake for the HPV vaccine was recorded at 82% for the first dose of the vaccine and 77% for the second dose.  This was the highest uptake of the HPV vaccination programme since 2015-16 and is especially encouraging because it was the first year in which boys were included in the programme.  It also shows that the provision of the vaccine in community clinics did not adversely affect the uptake.<\/p> <p>The programme for the academic year 2020-21 was paused during the first few months of this year due to school closures and redeployment of the staff.  The inputting of the uptake information for the schools-based programme was also delayed due to the redeployment of the administrative staff.  However, community healthcare organisations, CHOs, have reported that the vast majority of second level schools had their first dose of HPV vaccine delivered between October and December of last year.  The current record uptake rate for the HPV vaccine in the 2020-21 academic year is over 73% and the figure is probably higher because the administrative staff have not updated it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All CHOs have plans to recommence their school programme this month, which will see the continued roll-out of the HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>At the request of the Department, HIQA is conducting a HTA on a school-based HPV mop-up vaccination programme for those who were previously eligible and missed out on the vaccine.  HIQA has confirmed that the HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021-22.  I am told today that it is hoped that this work will be completed in the coming months.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has requested that officials give consideration to the outcome of this work.<\/p><p>Senator Conway inquired about the use of vaccination centres and if HIQA would consider redeploying the centres where we have a low turnout for a once-off mopping up programme.  In the context of mopping up, we are talking about children within school and college settings, but it also includes those aged under 24 who have moved on into workforce settings.  The mop-up programme is not set in a particular area.  We have a very broad lens when we are looking at it.  I am out of time so I will answer the Senator's third question when I speak next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#H00200","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>It is very encouraging to hear the statistics the Minister of State has put on the record.  I very much welcome the mop-up programme and the broad lens approach that is being adopted by the Department and the HSE because that is what we need to do.  We must think outside the box and the Department is doing that.<\/p> <p>I wish to inquire about the cost of vaccination for people who decided latterly to take up the vaccine, having not done so when the opportunity was initially available in schools.  Unfortunately, if parents see the obvious health benefits of vaccination and decide to bring a young person who was offered the vaccine six or 12 months previously for the vaccine, the cost is approximately &euro;600.  It is punitive and does not encourage people to take up the vaccine.  I hope the Minister of State will look at eliminating the cost because it would make vaccination far more attractive for people who were initially hesitant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#J00200","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Just before I came to the House today, I met the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, because I was taking this Commencement matter and the issue raised is a serious one.

I want my daughters vaccinated but like many other parents, I would like to bridge the gap and bring the current vaccination rate of 73% or 80% up to 100%.  We must ensure we make the vaccine available free of charge to all young people under 24 years in order that we have 100% take-up.  By doing that, we will bring everybody with us.  In addition, as Senator Conway correctly said, we have, in the vaccination centres, a system in place that means we do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We can use these centres to help in the mop-up exercise.  I was heartened to hear that the Minister is putting a package together, perhaps as part of his budgetary proposals, and HPV is part of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#J00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Will the &euro;600 charge be eliminated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#J00400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Yes.

I am glad I have been able to make it to the House because it is an important topic.  We were caught in traffic in Drogheda but we made it in time.  It is good to be here.<\/p> <p>We had a discussion on this last week as well. It is certainly a very relevant issue that has been raised by many colleagues across the board.  I have engaged with the various sectors and businesses over the summer and the availability of talent and skills is an issue that has come up quite a lot in the last three or four weeks.  The Senator mentioned bus drivers and lorry drivers.  That is a very common issue that is coming through a lot in recent weeks and months.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I also met with a number of retailers that are under serious pressure.  One of the groups involved had 50 or 60 jobs available on that day across four or five shops.  There are a lot of vacancies in many sectors, including in agrifood and agriculture.  We met the IFA last week, and this is a big issue for it too.  It is something we are trying to find ways to address across a number of Departments.<\/p> <p>The Senator raised the issue of visas and permits so I will focus on that but we are trying to look at this issue through Pathways to Work with the Minister for Social Protection and through my own Department, where the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, are working on it together.  We are also doing work in higher education with the Minister for of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins.  Across those three Departments, we intend to work with the various sectors this year and in the years ahead to try to address some of that skills gap through on-the-job training, higher education, further education and training, FET, apprenticeships and so on.  There are a lot of opportunities there.  Many of these sectors might not have had to avail of opportunities in the past so we will try to focus resources to make that happen as best we possibly can, in order to close the skills gap in the long term and future-proof this country.  In the short term, the Senator is right that there is a major issue in many sectors heading into Christmas.  That is something we are investigating under the permit structure to see how we can address that as well.<\/p> <p>The issue of visas is dealt with by the Minister for Justice.  The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and-or labour shortages in the short to medium term, in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills occupations list and the ineligible occupations list, which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.  In order to ensure that the employment permit system continues to meet the needs of the labour market and the economy, the lists are subject to twice-yearly evidence-based reviews.  Once one review is completed, the next review begins with the opening of a public consultation phase.<\/p> <p>In conducting the reviews, my Department works with other Departments to promote an integrated approach to address labour and skills shortages in the longer term.  Where shortages are clearly evidenced, the employment permit system is flexible enough to address them in real time.  The system is, by design, vacancy-led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market.  A review of the occupation lists is currently nearing completion, and all submissions are being actively considered in consultation with sectoral representatives, the relevant policy Departments and the economic migration interdepartmental group.  If it is an agriculture issue, we will engage with that Department, if it is to do with transport we will deal with the Department of Transport and so on.  It is envisaged that the review will be finalised in the coming weeks and any changes necessary to deal with verified skills or labour shortages will be taken at that time.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In regard to where we are today, applications for employment permits have seen a significant increase over the course of the year.

To date, my Department has issued some 10,849 employment permits since the beginning of the year, which represents a significant volume of activity.<\/p><p>Recently, processing times have been impacted by this significant increase in demand and also by the HSE cyberattack.  These factors resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with applications associated with the July doctors rotation which were submitted either manually or by other non-standard methods.  It is important to point out that when set against other international employment permit regimes, Ireland continues to compare extremely favourably.  However, my Department, which constantly strives to improve the situation, is conscious of the recent lengthening of timeframes for processing applications and is taking a range of measures to clear the current backlog as quickly as possible and deal with priority areas.  My Department advises employers to take current timelines into account as part of their recruitment plans but we are, of course, allocating more resources to help tackle the backlog as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#K00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

That is not always possible because of geography or training, but in many cases it is possible.  Through Pathways to Work, we are allowing for extra money to be allocated to support businesses to take people off the live register and off PUP, but also to help those people back into training, to upskill and to get them back to a job.  We will come at it from a number of angles, including Pathways to Work, job supports and incentives for industry, which will help to close some of the gap and bring people closer to a job.

At the weekend there were reports from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communication, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that Ireland is facing a tight few years until 2025 in terms of our energy supplies and that engineers were undergoing training for potential blackouts this winter.  This is a really serious situation that I am sure has caused much concern right across the board.  People are wondering what we are going to do to address the issue.  The year 2025 is quite a distance away.  It is a long time to be planning to have a deficiency in energy supplies to meet the demands of our citizens.  It would be important to get an update from the Minister at the earliest opportunity on that particular issue, especially his comments on the tight supplies that Ireland is facing into for the next four years.<\/p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of mica and pyrite homeowners which, as people will know, is a big issue, in particular in Mayo and Donegal where many homeowners are facing substantial rebuild costs for their homes.  The current scheme is not fit for purpose for these homeowners.  We have heard many tales of families who are devastated and have had to move out of their homes where they can afford to do so.  Other families have had to demolish their homes and are living in mobile homes while they try to get the money together to rebuild what were family homes.  I hope the issue can be resolved and I urge the Minister to find every way possible to provide 100% redress for those families to make sure they can rebuild their family homes.  It is a devastating situation for them to be in.<\/p> <p>The final issue I want to raise is the conversation that is currently happening around a bonus payment, a thank you payment or some sort of offering to those workers who were on the front line during the Covid pandemic, how that should work and what form it should take.  I mean no disrespect to any front-line worker.  Many people worked extremely hard over the past year and a half, in particular those in public-facing jobs.  There is a need to differentiate between those who worked in healthcare and looked after Covid patients.  I am thinking of a family member of mine.  In the early part of the pandemic we were genuinely worried that when she went to work she would get very sick and die.  That was how serious the situation was in the early part of the pandemic.  Front-line healthcare workers, in particular, went into work every day literally fighting face-to-face with Covid.  There were scenes from other countries, in particular Italy, of healthcare workers in full PPE who still got sick and died.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There were people who literally risked their lives every day to keep the health service on the road and keep the show going.  While not discounting the work done by people working in delivery, retail services or any other job like that, there is a distinct group of people who made great sacrifices and took great risks.  Very early on in the pandemic we did not know what we know now and we did not know whether people would be fully protected even wearing full gear.  Yet every day, they crossed the threshold of hospitals or home care settings to look after patients who had Covid-19.  All of these people were incredibly brave and if all these workers are offered is a bank holiday then that is a huge insult to the risks they took during the pandemic to keep people alive, to keep the rest of us safe and to stop the health service from crumbling.  I suggest and request that this particular cohort of workers be put in a distinct category separate from everybody else and that the risks to their lives that they undertook be acknowledged. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#N00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>No more than the Leader herself, I was proud to be a part of Governments that established the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, that put a new referendum on the rights of the child to the Irish people that was successfully passed, that provided the second free preschool year and included children with disability under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme through the access inclusion model and that enabled the introduction of the national child care scheme that this year will be funded by a budget of &euro;638 million, which is an increase of 141% on the figure five years previously.  However, investment lags behind other EU countries and childcare fees here are the highest in the European Union at &euro;184 per week.  During the pandemic we saw how society could not reopen in the absence of childcare being provided.  Special attention and negotiation had to be entered into to get childcare reopened and established in order that families could get back to some level of normality and provide the services that we all needed.<\/p> <p>As the Leader is no doubt aware, there is a campaign by various national associations to increase funding for the early years sector in next month's budget.  I ask her to arrange a debate on the issue of childcare and childcare costs next week, if possible, but certainly in advance of the budget with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  I wish to acknowledge the work that both Ministers have done on these matters.<\/p> <p>In addition, the wages paid to the people who work in the sector are low.  The yearly hourly pay for early years educators is &euro;11.91 and the majority of early years professionals earn less than the living wage.  I welcome the agreement and negotiations between the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, in respect of a joint labour committee for the sector, on which work is ongoing.<\/p> <p>Recently, I spoke to individuals in Galway who have worked in the sector for ten years but who have never had an increase in pay.  I also have spoken to small providers who have seen their insurance costs rise by 20% in a year.  It is hard to motivate people to stick with a very important career when there are no progressions, increments and nothing to say that in five years' time, one will be more valued and consequently will receive higher pay.  It is for that reason that people are leaving the sector and there is a high turnover in staff, which is regrettable.  As the Leader will know, it is difficult to get staff at the minimum wage.  There are up to nine organisations, and rightly so, that keep an eye on the childcare sector.  They are the HSE, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Pobal, fire officers, Tusla, the Department of Education and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That goes to show the importance that we bestow on the sector.  It is, therefore, important that we have a full and proper debate in advance of the budget to support the calls for increased funding in this very important sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#O00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I call the leader of the Opposition, Senator Victor Boyhan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#O00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I wish to refer to a report in the media today, which featured in a number of newspapers, that the Government will establish a new national task force to tackle the growing hospital waiting lists.

There are now 907,617 people waiting on treatment or assessment by a consultant and that is an increase over exactly one year of 66,167.

It is an amazing organisation and it validates these figures for the Department of Health.  The figures are extremely alarming.  I say this in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have had much debate about Sl&aacute;intecare and a lot of suggestions about why people left and did not leave.  I appreciate the enormous challenges faced by the Minister for Health.  I admire the Minister and I believe he is courageous.  It is a very difficult job but we have to move on and we must address these issues.  Based on these growing and alarming figures of 907,000, very shortly we will reach 1 million people waiting for treatment by consultants and for specialist care.  We need to have a serious conversation.  Doctors are alarmed and I believe the Government needs to be alarmed.  As I said before, health and housing will be the hallmark of this Government.  It is early and the Government has time on its side to deliver.  It is really important.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to again extend an invitation to An Taoiseach.  I am aware she said before that the Taoiseach is always welcome to this House.  Through the shared island unit he set up, and in which he has taken enormous interest, I am aware that he works closely and respectfully with all communities in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and issues all around Northern Ireland.  There are really exciting opportunities for the shared vision for the island of Ireland.  I would like to see the Taoiseach in the House as soon as his diary will permit.<\/p><p>I join with Senator Chambers, who is of course a native of Mayo and who probably knows more about the mica issue than most.  It is a real concern and heartbreaking to see people's houses crumbling.  I spent weeks in Mayo and Donegal this summer.  I met with councillors who live there and who showed me at first hand.  We are talking about housing for all and yet these people have homes that are crumbling in front of them.  Not only must they have them repaired and replaced, they must also get temporary accommodation while that work is happening.  I would welcome some sort of update or debate on that really important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#O00400","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I second Senator Kyne's suggestion for a debate on childcare.  One thing we have recognised as a result of the pandemic is just how hard it is to care for children and how important it is.  Childcare workers have been front-line workers throughout the pandemic and have kept the show on the road.  It is a matter of wages in the sector and also the lack of continuity of care because when people leave the sector it has an impact on children's well-being.  This is a critical aspect.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth said that childcare will be front and centre in his budget proposals.  We must deal with the wages in the sector, make the care affordable, and the kind of care children receive must be the very best we can make it.  While I will not say it is in the gift of the Minister for Finance, there is certainly a large element at play in terms of that Minister as to whether this can get over the line.  A full debate on that issue before the budget would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the fantastic result yesterday in Galway City Council where councillors voted 17:1 in favour of a temporary cycle lane in Salthill.  A couple of weeks ago it looked as though that vote would be lost.  This goes to the heart of some of the problems we have in our councils across the State.  It is not only to do with councillors but it also has to do with executives having a long list for councillors to go through with the reasons something might not work.  Funding was one of these reasons.  The Minister for Transport, however, is on record as saying that there is no issue around funding.  The next excuse will be something else.  Another excuse is: \"What will we do with cars?\".  This gets ticked off and then it moves on and on.  The same can be said for other projects and not just transport.  This must be addressed.  The councillors are representative of the people.

The Leader will know, and I am sure she will agree, that in recent months there has been a lot of noise generated about the protocol.  It is important to recentre ourselves and actually deal in facts and realities when it comes to the protocol and the protections and mitigations it offers this island and, specifically, to the North.  As we know, there is no good Brexit but the protocol protects the all-island economy.  It is timely that we consider having a range of statements from the Ministers on the roll-out of the protocol, its benefits including the positive impact it has on our economy, and the extent to which it protects people North and South.  Notwithstanding what Senator Chambers said about the issues we may face with energy on this island, when we look across the water and see the unmitigated chaos there, I am sure even those most begrudging of the protocol would understand that it is the protections and mitigations of the protocol that are defending and protecting us from that chaos developing here.<\/p> <p>We have seen impressive figures on the increase in North-South and South-North trade.  In the first seven months of 2021, the Central Statistics Office stated that North-South trade increased by 60% and trade from the South to the North increased by 43%.  I am sure the Leader will agree that they are some of the realities and, indeed, benefits of the protocol.  It is appropriate that we hear from Ministers whose briefs relate to the protocol and that they come into the House to update us on its roll-out in the future.<\/p> <p>I have submitted the following as a Commencement matter this week.  I hope it is something the Leader will raise with Government colleagues.  It was announced more than a week ago in the media that the Government plans to make the EU digital certificate available to fully vaccinated Irish passport holders in the North.  It said an online portal for accessing that certificate would be available soon.  There has been no further update forthcoming.  As the Leader can imagine, when news like this finds its way into the public domain - not least in the context of the many entitlements, rights and protections we have lost in the North as a result Brexit - it would be good to get clarity on when and how we can avail of this.  Perhaps the Leader will use her good office to encourage Government colleagues to get that message out there as soon as possible and to get it sorted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#Q00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I wish to mark International Safe Abortion Day and acknowledge the significant number of people who turned out on Saturday for the annual March for choice. Notwithstanding the enormous progress we made since the historic referendum three years ago, we still have significant issues regarding the delivery of abortion services in this country.  While the Government's review is welcome, I urge the Government not to delay publishing and progressing it.  The establishment of safe exclusion zones has been a long-promised commitment by the Government.  While there have been mixed messages from the Minister for Health during the summer, we need those safe exclusion zones for women and their partners, and for medical staff.  We need to look at the three-day waiting period and the 12-week threshold, which has caused significant distress, particularly in complex health cases and, of course, the patchy provision of abortion services since across this country, with only 10% of GPs and just ten out of the 19 maternity units offering the service.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to see that review as soon as possible.  <\/p><p>Another issue I wish to raise is in regard to Dublin Fire Brigade.  It is an issue for this city but it is also touches on the entire country, that is, ambulance and fire service response times and services.  As of yesterday, 20% of the Dublin Fire Brigade fleet could not be deployed because of serious staff shortages.  This is not a one-off situation; it has been ongoing for many months now.  There have been systematic failures to adequately recruit.  Dublin Fire Brigade is recruiting fewer staff than the numbers retiring this year and it has taken in fewer recruits than it would take in during a normal year.  It is failing to adequately plan for its workforce and it has never met the minimum staff standard agreed in 2015.  There has been a failure to meet the long-standing commitments with regard to equipment.<\/p><p>While this is an issue for Dublin City Council, which manages Dublin Fire Brigade on behalf of the four local authorities in Dublin, it is also one for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  Unless he puts in place the resources for our fire services, we will see a repeat of the horror we saw unfold in County Offaly yesterday.  If we had an incident of that magnitude in this city, there would be a very real issue with regard to the response.  This is not good enough for citizens or residents in the city communities, and firefighters.  <\/p><p>I want to raise one other issue.  Last week, the Leader raised MetroLink.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stated over the weekend that it will be the cheapest and quickest project that he wants to see concluded.  We need the Minister to come to the House.  I know the Leader will be fighting for that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#Q00300","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I echo the comments made around International Safe Abortion Day and note the launch today of an atlas of where safe access is across Europe.  It is notable that countries like San Marino and Gibraltar have followed Ireland's example in seeking to ensure access, but there are practical barriers still in place.  It will be important that in the review we address the practical, de facto barriers for people seeking to access their rights and avoid introducing any of the pitfalls we have seen in other countries which limit women's access to essential healthcare.<\/p> <p>I would also like to support the calls for a debate on childcare.  It is a matter of wages and conditions, but it is also a matter of progress in that, as identified by Senator Kyne, there are missing rungs on the ladder in terms of progression within childcare.  It is important we treat it, not as an area of commercial activity, but as an area of national infrastructure because it is national infrastructure on which all of our society relies.  <\/p> <p>My main purpose in speaking today is to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 16, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill 2021, be taken before No. 1.  The Bill would grant a five-year extension to the imminent deadline of 30 November for the registration of a right of way.  This is an issue I have been raising for over a year with the Government and Ministers.  I raised it first with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, because so many of the rights of way have a heritage purpose.  I then engaged on it with the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Peter Burke, around planning and development, the infrastructure that we need and the network represented by those rights of way.  Prior the summer, I had sought to put an amendment to the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2020 in order to address this simple issue.<\/p> <p>The Bill I will be introducing contains only one line, which is unusual for me.  As I said, it seeks to extend the period by five years.  We realised over the summer that rights of way which have been used for generations in Ireland have, in many cases, found a new purpose as part of networks of green connectivity, allowing family members of different ages to link in with towns, visit friends and connect to supports.  If we had a large-scale extinguishment of those rights of way on 30 November, the consequences would be extraordinarily bad, not just for individuals, families and easement rights, but for communities and connectivity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We would also lose the opportunity to reimagine those networks and to connect them with our rights of way in a meaningful way.

It is a little late, but we still have a month or two.

I am sure, like me, that the Leader is aware of many citizens coming to our towns who find it impossible to get access to a GP, which is a serious problem.<\/p> <p>I was heartened by an initiative adopted by the Irish Pharmacy Union.  That initiative has been put forward to alleviate some of the pressure on GPs.  It is called the minor ailments scheme.  Pharmacists maintain that they feel that they can alleviate much of the pressure on GPs in respect of up to 40 ailments, such as hay fever, many skin ailments, etc.  Apparently, the scheme has already been rolled out internationally, including in the UK, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands.  It has proved to be a great success.  Research from Scotland indicates that the system has the potential to eliminate one in every 20 emergency department visits and one in every seven GP visits.  We know that the pharmacies provide a great service.  They are located in many of our towns and villages across the length and breadth of the country.  There are about 1,900 in total.

However, that has not happened and my county is looking at a loss of &euro;1.2 million in rates as a result of those closures and the closure of other businesses.  That is a significant financial impact for the local authority.  I recently met with the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, and the just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey, and highlighted this issue.  Mr. Mulvey said that it would be extremely unfair, in circumstances for which it had no responsibility and in the context of a decision that is not expected until 2027, that the local authority should be burdened with this sudden loss.  He recommended that urgent engagement take place with the chief executive of the funding Department in order that suitable emergency arrangements could be put in place for the period 2021 to 2026.  Arrangements for 2021 have been put in place but no other commitments have been given.  All local authorities are putting budgets together for the period 2022 onwards.  The reality is that we cannot sustain the loss of that income.  It will severely hamper the delivery of services in our county.

Bus and tram drivers and all of the people worked on the front line - I do not care whether they were medical or non-medical - and the soldiers who were out on swabbing duty at test centres, everybody who went to work had an equal part.

The programme for Government also commits to providing free contraception over a phased period for women and girls aged 17 to 25 years.  The Minister for Health has said universal free access to contraception is a ministerial priority for him.  I raise this in advance of the budget because yesterday a report was launched on universal free access to contraception by the pharmaceutical company Bayer with the Irish Family Planning Association.  I do not need to tell anyone that universal free access to contraception was a key recommendation of the report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution in 2017.

I would use its information quite often.  The property price register, which has been a great tool since its inception, and is a fount of information on when a property is sold, the area, what it made and it is a great comparative tool particularly for auctioneers carrying out their work.  It helps to track prices because you can see the price of anything that has sold.<\/p> <p>There is one thing which is not on it.  It is hard to tell if a property is a two-bedroom house, a three-bedroom house or whatever.  When auctioneers look at a property from outside, they have a fair idea what it is.  The Eircode is not attached to the property price register.  This information is to hand at present because an Eircode is required for any property sold.  This information is there so I cannot see why it is not attached to the property price register.  This would be massively beneficial because if you were talking about a house in an area at least if you had the Eircode, you could identify the house and see that it is a four-bedroom semi-detached house, not a two-bedroom apartment or a three-bedroom detached.

The new completion date has been given to us today, after many weeks of speculation following media reports a couple of weeks ago.  This is only a hopeful date.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that &ldquo;hopefully&rdquo; we will be able to deliver MetroLink by 2034.  I would like to remind the House the exact schedule that we have been given for what was metro north and is now MetroLink.  In 2001, the project was first announced.  That was more than 20 years ago, when it was known as metro north.  It was given a completion date of 2012.  In 2011, it was postponed.  It was relaunched in 2015, with the completion date of 2027.  Now, we hear that it will not be completed until, at the very best, 2034.<\/p> <p>This is a devastating blow for the northside of Dublin.  When I say the northside, I mean north County Dublin and the north of city, the whole area of north Dublin, which is the fastest growing part of western Europe.  Not to have something major like a metro to deliver connectivity between communities, educational institutions and health institutions is a particularly bad blow for the people of Swords.  Swords has a population of more than 45,000.  To that in context, it is the size of Waterford city.  Swords has poor public transport infrastructure.  There is no DART in Swords, there is no Luas, and now there will not be any metro.  It is a disgrace.  People have finally lost hope that the metro will be delivered.<\/p> <p>North County Dublin has the youngest and the fastest growing population in Europe.  There is much construction going on there at the moment.  There are many planning applications in train also to deliver the much-needed homes for Dublin.  However, one cannot deliver these homes without transport infrastructure.  We need transport-led housing development.  This will create sustainable communities.  However, what is going on at present is unsustainable.  Those of us living in north County Dublin are facing crammed buses, crammed trains and overcrowded motorways.  It is disgraceful.  We have a busy airport which is serviced, by and large, by country boreens.  They are servicing Dublin Airport, which is a major employer and a major strategic point for this country.<\/p> <p>I want a full debate with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on the metro specifically.

I refer to the concept of introducing flexible three-day TaxSaver tickets for commuters.  I first raised this matter in June of last year.  More than 12 months have passed.  We have returned to full capacity on public transport and workers across the country have returned to their offices and yet we still do not have this type of ticket.  People must still pay for monthly and annual tickets when they may only be making four trips each week instead of the usual ten, which is unfair.  I am raising this issue because I ask for the assistance of the Leader and the House in trying to get some clarity from the National Transport Authority, NTA, regarding the process of moving forward with introducing this type of ticket.<\/p> <p>The response I received from the NTA referred to TaxSaver tickets being governed under tax legislation from the 1990s, which states that such tickets shall not apply in respect of \"expenses incurred by the body corporate in or in connection with the provision for a director or employee of a monthly or annual bus, railway or ferry travel pass\".  Therefore, the NTA is stating that one aspect of the issue is that it does not know whether legislative change is required to introduce this type of ticket, since the legislation clearly refers to \"monthly or annual\" passes.  The NTA is trying to figure out if it might be possible to introduce a ticket that would be valid for 100 days of travel in a year and which would also fit within the definition contained in the legislation.  As I see it then, the NTA is stating that the problem is that it does not know if legislative change is required or whether it might be possible to introduce a flexible ticket within the parameters of the 1997 legislation.<\/p> <p>If legislative change is required, it is a pity that it has not been brought forward yet.  Given that we passed so much legislation regarding Covid-19 in the past year and a half, I am of the view that this matter should have been addressed by now.  It is a bit late in the day to state that we are still trying to determine if legislative change is required.  My hope is that we could write to the NTA to get clarity on this issue.  If legislative change is needed to introduce a flexible TaxSaver ticket, then we could find that out.  If legislative change is needed, let us go ahead and do that and if such change is not needed, then let us take the next step once we have that clarity.  The NTA told me that it hopes to introduce this type of ticket in quarter 1 or quarter 2 of next year.

Ireland should be a leader in the area of remote working.  We can be competitive and be compassionate about our workers at the same time.  A working group was launched yesterday called the Remote Alliance.  It consists of four leading Irish employers: eBay and Liberty Insurance, companies that I am pleased to say are located in Dublin 15, and the ESB and Vodafone.  Those businesses have come together to drive the cultural change required to embrace remote working permanently.  People might ask why this is needed now when we seem to have been talking non-stop about remote working over the past year.  In that time, we have gone from a situation where everyone was predominantly office-based to one where everybody has been working from home.  Now we need to do the hard part, which involves embracing a mixture of both working environments and achieving a balance.  Some people will want the best of both worlds and that will mean that some people will be managing teams with different preferences.  Therefore, managerial and organisational change will be required.

Companies that have been thriving and saving their money should be passing that on to their employees and not all of them have.  Employees are then opting for the personal tax relief, which is much less.  The question is how we make that more equitable and how do we ensure we are supporting hubs.

We seem to be talking about the issue an awful lot but not doing much as regards taking the action required to deliver a sustainable sector for the people working in it and the parents and children who need it.  It is beyond time we started doing something about it.  I will arrange a debate on childcare as quickly as I can in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boyhan talked about the new task force to tackle growing waiting lists.  We need a debate on Sl&aacute;intecare, for which Senator Gallagher asked last week.  I submitted a request to the Minister and will come back to the Senators as soon as I can on the matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Kyne spoke about wages in the childcare sector.  Senator Chambers opened today with Ireland's energy supplies and the insecurities in that regard.  The Minister is due in to us on 2 November to have a debate on energy security.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan asked for a debate on waiting lists.  The Minister for Health is due in to us on 4 December and I have been informed that the Sl&aacute;intecare debate will take place then.<\/p><p>Senator Chambers also gave her view on how the State should respond to all the front-line workers, who over the past 18 months have done tremendous and Trojan work in making sure we stayed safe, were minded and had food to buy in shops and transport to get to and from where we needed to go.  The Garda had some tremendously difficult situations to deal with and I do not think its members should be forgotten.  I do not believe we should start pitting parts of the public sector and the private sector against each other.  I have no doubt it will be difficult to try to please everybody but what we need to do is to show genuine appreciation on behalf of all citizens of the State to all of those workers who made sure that we were safe and minded well over the past 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092800002#Y00300","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632835800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins has moved an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 16 be taken before No. 1\".
