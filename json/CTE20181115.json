He is joined by Ms Mahin Fitzpatrick, senior auditor.  We will meet the Revenue Commissioners today and a number of chapters in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General relate to Revenue.  We will also have a private meeting in the afternoon.  I suggest, therefore, that for reasons of time we confine our discussion on the business of the committee to one hour.  We will go as far as we can and commence our meeting with the Revenue at 10 a.m.  That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Pat Deering and Peter Burke.  I will hold over the minutes of the previous meeting for the moment.  Arising from the previous meeting, the clerk will circulate wording tomorrow, for consideration next week, regarding our recommendation for a D&aacute;il debate on the winding down of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  We agreed last week that there should be a D&aacute;il debate on the issue but we have to table a formal motion, which must be circulated to members for their consideration in advance before it can be agreed.  We can agree the motion for a D&aacute;il debate on NAMA's expected surplus next week.<\/p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence.  The first category is category A, briefing documents and the opening statement for today's meeting.  No. 1709A is from Mr. Niall Cody and encloses a briefing document.  No. 1723A is the opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish these documents.<\/p> <p>  The next category of correspondence is category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers in follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other correspondence for publishing.  We will hold over a number of matters from the previous meeting.  We got through a significant number of items last week.  I hope we will deal with all of them next week.<\/p> <p>  No. 1677B is from Chief Superintendent Dermot Mann of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is dated 31 October 2018.  It provides information requested by the committee on the operation of CCTV by local authorities.  It sets out the relevant legislation and statutory instruments and refers to the CCTV advisory committee and community CCTV schemes.  I know of a number of local authorities where CCTV schemes have not yet been finalised.  Given that the letter will be of interest to many people, we will note and publish it.<\/p> <p>  No. 1693B is from Ms Orlaith McBride, director of the Arts Council, dated 1 November 2018, enclosing an information note requested by the committee providing details in respect of matters raised in the audit opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the 2017 financial statements.  Significant issues arise in this regard and the one which attracted our attention in the first instance was the circumstances that gave rise to &euro;196,000 in funding being provided to an outside agency that went into liquidation.  The Arts Council has provided a detailed and comprehensive response.  I note that it dealt with the organisation in question, Filmbase, for 30 years.  We can understand, therefore, why the money continued to be paid each year.  The council did not get the audited accounts it sought for 2016.  It wanted the matter examined by its internal auditors but shortly afterwards Filmbase into liquidation.  The Arts Council is dealing with the liquidator to try to recover the moneys but it is listed as a trade creditor.  It made payments to some of those who should have been paid by Filmbase to avoid them being left high and dry.  It is doing all it can at this stage to recover the money.  When dealing with liquidators, people have to wait and see, as we all know.<\/p> <p>  No. 1698B is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, dated 6 November 2018, providing details requested by the committee on the performance delivery agreement between the Department and Galway 2020.  I propose we note and publish that correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#B00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1542272400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I welcome that because it has taken some time to get this information.

We will place it in the public arena, rather than sitting on it, in order that people can see the significant costs involved.<\/p> <p>  No. 1703B is from Mr. Paul Dunne, CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, dated 2 November 2018 in respect of a request from the committee for a copy of a report arising from a value for money review of Irish Public Bodies, IPB, insurance.  Mr. Dunne advises that the report is subject to a non-disclosure agreement between the LGMA, Irish Public Bodies and PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, dated 2 September 2015.  Mr Dunne has written to IPB and PwC to request their consent for the LGMA to release the report to the committee and is waiting for a response.  It is important to point out that this was a report on insurance claims.  It became clear during our discussion with the State Claims Agency that the section 38 organisations come under the State Claims Agency and account for between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion of activity each year.  I asked whether the local authorities could come within the remit of the State Claims Agency.  The local authorities currently obtain cover through IPB insurance and we asked for a copy of the value for money report.  We have been told it is very difficult to obtain a copy.  In addition, Mr. Dunne of the LGMA confirms that \"there are currently legal proceedings in being in relation to the release of the Report bearing Reference - High Court Record No. 2017 \/321MCA.\"  In addition, he notes that the case \"is an appeal by IPB of a decision of the Information Commissioner with regard to the release of the Report under the Freedom of Information Act, 2014.\"<\/p><p>The Information Commissioner has said that this is to be released but Irish Public Bodies has gone to the High Court to prevent it.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I will watch this closely but the proper procedure is that, if the report has been carried out on the question of public bodies, which are funded substantially by a Vote of the Oireachtas even if they are not directly accountable to this Oireachtas, having insurance policies for claims made against them by members of the public, it should be published.  It is very disappointing to hear that Irish Public Bodies is going to the High Court to prevent such an important report being published when the Information Commissioner has said it should be published.  We will come back to this because there is a big insurance issue here.  We are also dealing with matters relating to the State Claims Agency.  Claims to local authorities might not specifically be under our remit but they are in the same space as far as the public are concerned.  It is disappointing that IPB is trying to block the release of this report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#B01100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542272400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>There is a cost associated with doing it too, in the form of legal costs at High Court level.

In 2009, 51% of its overall portfolio was leased and 49% owned but in 2015 44%  was leased versus 56% owned, so the office has been in a position to let go of some of its leased buildings over a period of time.

I have had contact, as I am sure have other members, with people following the meeting last week about other strands of liability.  A broad range of issues make up that liability and we almost have to decouple them from where the liability lies if we are to get to an approach that involves a different system.  Despite what the State Claims Agency says, one has to go legal.  What we heard about the way claims occur nearly always has to be legal.  It is not about mediation in the way we understand mediation.  If a couple are getting divorced, the two parties sit in different rooms with another person to try to work things out, and they never end up anywhere near the court.  That is now how it is in this case; one almost has to make a statement of claim.  We will never get beyond that to a different system unless the system itself is challenged.  That is not to say that the State Claims Agency should not robustly go through claims.  Obviously, people will make claims that are overstated and so on but I do not believe we have got to the point where we are looking at the process in the kind of detail necessary to address that.<\/p> <p>  On the second issue, CervicalCheck, we were spun a yarn last week about the length of time it is taking to release the slides.

We have begun to break it down and we asked for very detailed specific information, not down to identifying people.  Quite a bit of information will come to us, more than anybody in the public arena has seen previously, which is very important.  That is an issue to which we will certainly return and deal with in depth.<\/p><p>The next item is 1706B<b><\/b>from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe, Tax Appeals Commission, dated 7 November 2018, providing an update requested by the committee on high value appeals.  We mentioned the large number of high value appeals.  If people want to raise it with the Revenue witnesses today, they are free to do so.  We will note and publish that.<\/p><p>No. 1707B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, dated 8 November 2018, providing a briefing note in regard to circulars in the context of the regularisation process provided for in a HSE circular regarding the regularisation of acting posts in conjunction with the new arrangements for the filling of short-term posts and the reintroduction of senior staff nurse positions.  Essentially, some people felt that while the HSE said it sent out the circular and the information to the different heads of the organisation, many people on the ground are saying that it never worked its way down to that level.  This letter makes that clear and we note and publish this and send it back to the correspondent who raised this matter with us in the first place and to let staff who are still aggrieved in relation to the process know that there is no cost to putting in a claim and there is a grievance procedure in this matter which is outlined in section 4 of that briefing note.<br\/><br\/>No. 1711B is from Ms Mary Lawlor, communications and public affairs manager with NAMA, providing further details requested by the committee on Project Nantes.  I propose we send a copy of this to Deputy Wallace who raised the matter and on whose suggestion I also raised the matter here.  I will read that letter because it is interesting and gives a broader perspective on the matter.  I will skip a sentence or two because it is so big but because of the amount of money involved and the controversy I will respond on this because there was an article on this issue in the Sunday newspapers as well.  The letter reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>I refer to your letter dated 23 October 2018 in which you requested additional information regarding Project Nantes.<br \/><br \/>As regards the first and second queries raised in the letter, NAMA wishes to point out that Project Nantes was only one of a number of separate transactions involving the debtor connection.  Overall, the connection&rsquo;s par debt was &euro;489 million on acquisition by NAMA.  This included some &euro;260 million of debt categorised as equity-backed loans which had been advanced to the connection by the participating institutions i.e. these loans were secured not by property collateral but by intangible assets (such as personal guarantees) which had no tangible value.  NAMA did not pay the participating institutions any consideration for these &euro;260 million equity-backed loans.  Thus, only &euro;229 million of the &euro;489 million par debt acquired was secured by tangible property assets with a realisable market value.<\/blockquote><p>That is important because it means that in relation to this particular person, the amount of loans that NAMA took over was &euro;489 million - &euro;229 million of that amount was secured by property and the other &euro;260 million was only secured by way of a personal guarantee and because the personal guarantee was not tangible, NAMA paid zero for that &euro;260 million.  It is important to put it out there that NAMA did not pay for a considerable amount of the &euro;489 million because it only effectively paid for a portion of the &euro;229 million.  That said, the taxpayer was caught in the hoop for all of it because we bailed out the banks for the shortfall.  NAMA might say that its side of it is clear but the taxpayer was caught for 100% of that unsecured loan because the banks had to receive funding as a result of that.  The letter continues with the following:<\/p><blockquote>The debtor connection agreed to initiate a programme of asset sales and debt refinancing so as to maximise recovery for NAMA ... Ultimately, total proceeds of approximately &euro;200 million were realised from loan, property and other loan security realisations.  As part of the disposal programme, a loan sale of debt with a par value of &euro;352 million, designated Project Nantes, realised proceeds of &euro;26.6 million.  This transaction included &euro;241 million (&euro;260 million at acquisition) in equity-backed loans (for which NAMA had not paid consideration) and &euro;111 million par debt secured by assets.  Therefore, the &euro;26.6 million realised for Project Nantes related to par debt loans of &euro;111 million (part of the original acquired property-secured par debt of &euro;229 million).<br \/><br \/>Thus, in total, proceeds of approximately &euro;200 million were realised from the asset sales and loan sale\/refinancing, equating to a recovery of 87% of the original acquired property-secured par debt of &euro;229 million. The proceeds realised were well in excess of the recovery target set by NAMA for the connection and the acquisition value paid by NAMA to the participating institutions.<br \/><br \/>As regards the third query raised in the Committee&rsquo;s letter, I can advise that NAMA has been investigating this matter.  As part of this, NAMA undertook a review of the written confirmations and warranties in respect of section 172(3) of the NAMA Act 2009, which were provided by the borrowers and purchaser at the time of the loan sale in 2012.  These confirm that the borrower and purchaser were compliant with the requirements of section 172(3) of the NAMA Act 2009.  Following enquiries raised by NAMA, it has been established that the party who has been identified as a director of the purchaser entity was not a NAMA debtor.<\/blockquote><p>Maybe there was another connection with a NAMA debtor but the letter says that the person was not a NAMA debtor so there is wiggle room there.  The letter continues with the following:<\/p><blockquote>NAMA wishes to be helpful to the Committee but is required by law to operate by reference to the prohibitions on disclosure of confidential debtor information.<\/blockquote><p>Essentially it cannot say more.  There is some information there but there is still some wiggle room in there.  Some people are interested in that and I read it into the record because it is big money, it is a matter people are concerned about and it has attracted much public comment.<br\/><br\/>We note and publish that letter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#D02500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542272400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I want to say something on that.

It is on our work programme.<\/p> <p>  Next, we held over No. 1595 C from our previous meeting.  We will revert to it.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence Nos. 1674 C, dated 22 October, and 1716 C, dated 7 November, are from an individual who made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the OPW in terms of \"Strengthening Civil Service Accountability and Performance\".  We requested the relevant report at our meeting with the OPW.  Members will recall that the report reviewed five specific properties.  The individual also provides the details of other properties on which he believes value for money was not achieved, namely, the former Passport Office and the Garda offices on Harcourt Street.  The individual believes that an independent report should be commissioned by the OPW.<\/p> <p>  We have dealt with the correspondence from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the OPW, which provided considerable information, including background information, regarding recent developments in the property management division.  While we might have to return to this topic in the new year, I propose that we ask the chairman to provide a further update on developments to ensure effective property management and that we advise the correspondent accordingly.  We have agreed to invite in the former employee who wrote the report.  This is on our work programme.  We will deal with the matter as soon as we set a date.<\/p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 1697 C from an individual, forwarded to the committee, regarding a value for money query relating to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The bank is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and I propose that, with the correspondent's permission and appropriate redactions, we forward the correspondence to the SBCI.  I understand that the clerk to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has been in correspondence with that organisation.  I propose that the two clerks liaise and seek an update on any intended action.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This correspondence has gone to two committees.<\/p> <p>  No. 1710 C from an individual dated 8 November relates to property leases undertaken on behalf of the State by the OPW.  We will note this correspondence and take it into consideration during our meeting with the former OPW employee.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 1712 C and 1713 C, dated 7 November, are from an individual who has been in correspondence with us regarding Cork Education and Training Board, ETB.  The board has advised the committee that the individual agreed a full and final settlement with it of all outstanding complaints, including a provision that the individual would not apply for any further position within the ETB.  The Department of Education and Skills provided advice to the effect that the individual was free to accept or reject any or all of the settlement, and encouraging the individual to engage with the ETB, through the individual's legal advisers, to reach a settlement.  The responses from the ETB and the Department were forwarded to the correspondent.  I propose that we advise the correspondent that our consideration of the matter is now closed.  Has anyone a comment on this?  I think we taken it as far as we can?  While it sounds severe, the person, with the individual's legal advisers, signed the agreement.  We are not going to unravel an agreement into which someone entered freely, full stop.  That is all I can say.<\/p> <p>  That marks the end of today's correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#F01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1542272400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I wish to raise two issues quickly.

The 2017 Revenue account, which was certified in April 2018, was examined by the committee at a meeting last June.<\/p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, rather than the Revenue account.  The 2017 appropriation accounts show that the total spent by Revenue in the year was &euro;411 million. Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;71 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;340 million.  The surrender for the year was &euro;3.4 million.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 17 examines the actions taken by Revenue in recent years to tackle the issue of tobacco smuggling, which represents a significant risk to tax receipts.  Revenue and the National Office for Tobacco Control commission an annual survey to estimate the extent of illicit tobacco related activity in Ireland.  Based on the survey, Revenue estimates that 13% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2017 were illegal, with an associated notional loss of revenue of approximately &euro;229 million.<\/p> <p>  Revenue seizures of cigarettes and tobacco in 2017 were worth in excess of &euro;20 million at normal prices, representing a potential loss to the Exchequer of &euro;16 million in taxes and duties.  Relative to the estimated overall loss of &euro;229 million, this implies a Revenue detection rate for illegal cigarettes of approximately 7%.  The value of any seizures that take place abroad with Revenue&rsquo;s assistance is not recorded as there is no formal mechanism in place to account for such events.<\/p> <p>  Figure 17.7 refers to expenditure of more than &euro;400,000 incurred by Revenue up to the end of August 2018 relating to the ongoing holding in Dublin Port of a ship that was seized in 2014 for carrying illegal cigarettes and tobacco.  Significant disposal costs may also arise.  This expenditure is charged to Vote 9.<\/p> <p>  Revenue published its first stand-alone strategy on combating the illicit tobacco trade covering the period 2011 to 2013.<\/p><p>A follow-on stand-alone strategy was not produced.  However, Revenue is finalising a national action plan to combat illicit tobacco, with a focus on increased international co-operation.<\/p><p> Chapter 18 outlines Revenue&rsquo;s approach to monitoring and managing the tax affairs of high wealth individuals.  These are managed by a dedicated unit within Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division.  A specific case manager is assigned to each individual.  As at June 2018, the unit was managing approximately 480 individuals.  The unit was also dealing with around 140 trusts, partnerships and other legal entities related to these individuals.  Revenue&rsquo;s criterion for someone to be considered a high wealth individual is that the person is known or believed to have net assets of more than &euro;50 million.  This is a high threshold compared with other jurisdictions.<\/p><p> High wealth individuals tend to operate in multiple business sectors.  Revenue's practice in that regard is to assign a sectoral code to each high wealth individual that reflects his or her primary activity.  On that basis, around one third of high wealth individuals operate primarily in the real estate sector.  High wealth individuals&rsquo; tax liabilities cover a range of tax categories.  At the time of the examination, the most recent data provided by Revenue on tax liabilities for high wealth individuals were for 2015.  In that year, high wealth individuals accounted for 3.4% of all net income tax due, 9.3% of capital gains tax receipts and 2% of all capital acquisitions tax receipts.<\/p><p> High wealth individuals filed 334 income tax returns in 2015.  The number of returns filed is lower than the number of individuals managed in the unit for a number of reasons. For example, a jointly assessed couple, both classed as high wealth individuals, would count as one taxpayer unit and file one income tax return.  The unit also monitors individuals known to have substantial economic interests in Ireland but who may not have a requirement to file an income tax return in Ireland.<\/p><p> The income tax due from high wealth individuals who made income tax returns in 2015 was highly concentrated, with very significant variations between the 334 returns.  Some 85% of the total income tax liability was due from just ten taxpayers.  Across the group, the average effective tax rate was 39.2%, more than double the average rate of 16.3% for all income taxpayers.  However, 90 high wealth individuals had an effective income tax rate less than the national average rate.<\/p><p> The examination reviewed a sample of 30 compliance interventions undertaken by Revenue which resulted in additional tax being collected from high wealth individuals.  Of these, 14 had availed of a qualifying avoidance disclosure programme, QAD, to settle their tax affairs.  A QAD allows a taxpayer who entered into a tax avoidance transaction to settle with Revenue by paying the full tax and interest due at the time of the disclosure.  Incentives for the taxpayer in such QAD cases are a 20% reduction in the amount of interest otherwise due and the avoidance of penalties and publication as defaulters.<\/p><p> For one of the intervention cases reviewed, Revenue had agreed to a phased payment arrangement on the basis of limited documentation.  Another 26 taxpayers involved in the same tax avoidance scheme were granted the same settlement arrangements without the specified evidence.  Revenue guidelines set out the evidence required but also state that some cases may fall outside the guidelines.  However, the guidelines do not explicitly state in what circumstances such an exception should be made.<\/p><p> Chapter 19 reviews recent trends in corporation tax losses and follows on from a report I presented last year on corporation tax.  Companies are liable for corporation tax in respect of all profits arising from income or gains.  Where a company reports a trading loss, that loss can be used to obtain relief from the payment of corporation tax.  Losses carried forward by companies can be made up of a combination of unused capital allowances and trading losses.  However, Revenue&rsquo;s systems do not identify unused capital allowances carried forward separately from the overall losses carried forward.  There is a high degree of concentration in companies that have accumulated losses.  In 2016, a total of &euro;231 billion of losses and unused capital allowances was available for offset against profits.  Those available losses and allowances could potentially result in the lowering, over a number of future years, of corporation tax receipts by the order of &euro;29 billion.  This overhang of losses is, consequently, a key variable in the outturn of corporation tax receipts.<\/p><p> As has been noted previously, corporation tax receipts have consistently outperformed forecasts in recent years, particularly since 2015.  Based on prior year trends, Revenue forecasts receipts on a net basis, that is, after the impact of losses.  Separate forecasting of gross receipts and of the usage of losses may offer some potential for improved forecasting accuracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542272400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Today's meeting is to focus on the Revenue Vote and three chapters of the 2017 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in September.  These are chapter 17 - Tackling Tobacco Smuggling, chapter 18 - Management of High Wealth Individuals' Tax Liabilities and chapter 19 - Corporation Tax Losses.  In welcoming this opportunity to address the findings of the report, I draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.<\/p> <p>  Revenue's role is to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls.  Our aim is to protect Exchequer funds and ensure that everyone meets their tax and duty obligations in accordance with the law.  Our strategy is consistent across all taxpayer segments.  We provide the service to make it as easy as possible for taxpayers to understand and meet their tax and duty obligations and we prioritise the protection of Exchequer funds and support compliant taxpayers by identifying, targeting, and tackling non-compliance on a risk basis.<\/p> <p>  Revenue's response to non-compliance in all its forms, from the more straightforward non-filing of tax returns to complex tax avoidance schemes and criminal tax and excise fraud, is risk based, proportionate and responsive to taxpayer behaviour.<\/p> <p>  In chapter 17, the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews Revenue's progress in tackling tobacco smuggling and acknowledges that this is a global problem.  The European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, estimates that cigarette smuggling costs national and EU budgets more than &euro;10 billion annually.  The illicit tobacco trade is known to be dominated by internationally organised criminal groups who are often also involved in other crime such as drug smuggling, money laundering and people trafficking.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, tobacco taxation is a key policy instrument in reducing tobacco consumption.  In keeping with the Government's public health objectives, we have one of the highest rates of tobacco tax in Europe.  In the most popular price category of cigarettes, total tax, excise and VAT, now represents just over 79% of the retail price per pack in Ireland.  Tobacco tax is a significant source of revenue and generated &euro;1.4 billion in tax receipts in 2017.  While the high tax policy has resulted in progress in reducing tobacco consumption, the trade-off is that it incentivises illicit trade.  Tackling this is a key priority for Revenue.<\/p> <p>  Measurement of the illicit tobacco trade is known to be challenging.  In a report in 2014, the World Health Organization, WHO, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, FCTC, recognised that all methods to estimate illicit tobacco trade have their limitations.  That report indicated the very wide variations between countries in the percentage of the national cigarette market constituted by illicit cigarettes, for example, Latvia at 41%, Sweden at 20%, and Italy at 3.5%, and estimated the market share for illicit cigarettes within the EU at 10.4%.<\/p> <p>  Revenue's best estimate of the scale of the illicit tobacco market in Ireland is provided by an annual survey conducted by Ipsos MRBI on behalf of Revenue and the national tobacco control office of the HSE.  The primary usefulness of this measure is to track the trend over time.  The 2017 survey found 13% of packs to be illegal, up from 10% in 2016 and 12% in 2015.  This follows the recognised trend Europe wide.  For comparative purposes, in the UK, where a high tobacco tax policy similarly applies, in 2016-2017 the illicit cigarette market was 15%, up from 13% in 2015-2016 and 8% in 2014-2015.<\/p><p>Based on 2017 survey results, the nominal loss to the Exchequer in 2017 is approximately &euro;229 million in excise and VAT.  While this provides an indication of the financial significance of the problem, it is based on the improbable assumption that if there were no illicit cheap cigarettes, those smokers would buy the same number of more expensive, taxed cigarettes using money they are currently not spending on any form of taxable consumption.  That aside, we know that the illicit tobacco trade represents a significant threat to Government health policy, Exchequer funds, legitimate trade and Revenue's strategy to maximise voluntary compliance.  We also know that it funds international organised crime.  Revenue devotes considerable resources to challenging all stages in the supply chain for illicit tobacco products.  We work to identify and target those involved in smuggling, supplying or selling illicit tobacco products, with a view to disrupting supply, seizing the illicit products and maximising our impact by prosecuting those involved, wherever possible.<\/p><p> In 2017 we seized more than 34.24 million cigarettes and 1,768 kg of tobacco with a combined retail value of &euro;20.34 million.  The comparative figures to the end of October this year are 58.9 million cigarettes and 1,685 kg of tobacco with a total retail value of &euro;36.5 million.  This includes tobacco products seized in March 2018, when a Revenue-led operation resulted in the discovery and closure of a counterfeit cigarette factory in County Louth, the first of its kind to be discovered in the State.  Up to the end of October this year, our prosecution cases for tobacco smuggling or selling offences have resulted in 60 summary convictions, five indictable convictions, fines totalling &euro;140,250, nine suspended sentences and one custodial sentence of six months' imprisonment.  Alongside this, Revenue has worked with the Department of Health over the past two years on a new \"track and trace\" system to regulate the legitimate tobacco supply chain across Europe.  Revenue was recently designated by the Government as the competent authority in Ireland for this new system, which is due to be introduced during 2019.<\/p><p> To summarise, we aim to contain and diminish the illicit tobacco market to the greatest extent possible.  Our performance is probably most appropriately measured by the outcomes of our efforts and changes in the size of the illicit tobacco market here relative to other countries with similar tobacco tax policies.  I assure the committee that tackling the illicit tobacco trade will continue to be a key Revenue priority as, in tandem with facilitating the free flow of legitimate trade, we work to identify, target and confront a diverse and agile smuggling trade operated at global level with significant involvement of both national and international organised crime groups.  We meet these challenges by prioritising national and international co-operation, investment in technology, and intelligence development.  We work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the European Anti-Fraud Office, Europol and fellow customs administrations in the EU and beyond.  In the context of our structural realignment, our actions will be co-ordinated in a national operational plan to maximise our impact on those involved at every stage of the illegal supply chain and deliver the best possible outcome in protecting Exchequer funds.<\/p><p> Turning to chapter 18 on the management of high-wealth individuals' tax liabilities, the Comptroller and Auditor General reports that in 2015, 334 high-worth individuals, HWIs, paid a total &euro;545 million in income tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  In line with best international practice, and since 2003, Revenue has dealt with large corporates and HWIs in a dedicated large cases division.  In a further refinement to this model this year, we have divided the large cases division, LCD, into two: one division focuses on large corporates, and the other on HWIs, including family members and related entities.  A significant feature of the HWI segment is that HWIs' income derives largely from capital rather than earnings.  The IMF notes that globally, HWIs maintain more than half of their wealth portfolio in cash and equities, the balance in property and investments - for example, funds, derivatives, currency, and commodities.  A stock of wealth may be held personally, in trusts, and in legal entities effectively controlled by an individual or family group.  Flows of income may fluctuate and may be planned and managed.  From our experience, we also know that individuals who have a high level of accumulated net wealth are likely to be actively engaged in wealth management and personal tax planning and subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and, in the context of wealth preservation, pay attention to global and local tax policy and legislation.<\/p><p> There is no evidence, and Revenue does not assume, that wealthy individuals are more likely to be tax non-compliant.  As a result of the financial complexities and potential tax yield in the HWI segment, Revenue applies close individual attention, and considerable skill and expertise, to managing tax compliance across the sector.  Revenue case managers use their detailed case knowledge, together with our data analytics capabilities and the extensive available range of Revenue, third party and internationally exchanged information, to manage compliance, profile risk and identify cases for intervention.  In 2017, the total yield in tax, interest and penalties from our HWI compliance interventions was &euro;15.3 million.<\/p><p> This chapter also refers to tax avoidance, which occurs where transactions are undertaken primarily to give rise to a tax advantage.  The focus of Revenue anti-avoidance teams encompasses the entire case base because use of legislation other than as intended can present real risks to the tax base and the perceived fairness of the tax system.  Also, and in line with international best practice, our HWI and anti-avoidance units work closely together.  We identify and investigate schemes and oversee legal challenges up to the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court, as may be required, or negotiate a tax settlement, including interest and penalties, as appropriate.  We make any necessary recommendations for legislative amendments to prevent tax leakage.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General goes on in chapter 19 to consider corporation tax trading losses, capital allowances and losses carried forward.  There are no recommendations for Revenue in this chapter.  Last month I wrote to the committee, as requested, setting out Revenue's work on the estimation of corporation tax receipts, operating as we do in a supporting role to the Department of Finance, which compiles and publishes forecasts of all taxes, including corporation tax.<\/p><p> In summary, the Comptroller and Auditor General makes five recommendations on tackling tobacco smuggling and three on the management of HWIs' tax liabilities, all of which are agreed.  Consistent with Revenue's focus on continuous improvement to achieve the best possible return on resources, our new national structure deploys staff across a broad geographical spread, our national operational plan will co-ordinate and integrate our anti-smuggling actions and we are engaged in a significant risk-based shift of resources towards our medium enterprise, HWI and large corporates divisions.  I have provided a separate note to the committee on our structural realignment under way.  The purpose of our realignment is to provide a greater match of resources to risk, to reflect the changes in the economic environment in which we operate and to maximise the use of our resources across the country.  Among the levers that make this possible are the digital dividends and efficiencies created by our ongoing investment in data analytics, our extended range of online services, and key projects such as PAYE modernisation.  Finally, and given the focus of chapter 18 on a very small, distinct group of taxpayers, I again draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542272400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody.

These resignations have sent reverberations across the political world, especially in Europe.  The reality is that Theresa May probably expected someone to go overboard but, obviously, her Brexit Secretary is a significant loss.  To lose one Brexit Secretary is unfortunate but she has lost two.

In his Budget Statement, the Minister made fleeting reference to the Revenue Commissioners and the potential Border posts, but it was our finance spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, who in his speech pressed the Minister on this and on the Government's plans to hire just 200 Brexit customs officials by the deadline next spring, even though it was reported in the press that Revenue estimated an extra 600 members of staff were needed for the transition period and the future EU-UK trade deal.  Will Mr. Cody confirm that just 200 officials will be trained and in place by 29 March next year?  Does Revenue need the 600 officials, as reported in the media on the day of the budget?

The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has invited me in to talk about Brexit next Tuesday.  I replied yesterday suggesting it might be more opportune to have the discussion some time later, given we are now in the midst of what is very much a political process.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the commentary about our requirement for Brexit, Government decisions that took place in July and September relating to the recruitment of additional staff and the case we have made, the Minister set out in an answer to a recent parliamentary question from Fianna F&aacute;il's finance spokesman that in September the Government approved our case for additional resources from now until January 2021.  The agreement was that we would require approximately 600 additional members of staff for the end of the transition period.  In the decision in September, which was picked up and analysed by the media, we set out a planned recruitment campaign, which has started, and approximately 40 people in this quarter will enter a dedicated training programme for customs.  In the first quarter of next year, we will hire an additional 230 officials, resulting in 270 being in place for 29 March to facilitate the ongoing engagement with industry on Brexit-related issues and the implications for customs because it tends to be the larger corporations that are engaged in importing and exporting outside the community.  We agreed that over the remainder of 2019 and through the start of 2020 we will continue our recruitment process to have the 600 officials in place by the end of the transition period.  <\/p> <p>  That was as it was set out at the time but when people hear the figures it is all added up together and they wonder where the new staff are, but that was the planned process.  In the event of no deal, we agreed, as the Minister stated in his reply to the parliamentary question, we would have to consider how we could speed up the process of recruitment.  We will not have everyone in place by April, but we will be able to speed up recruitment.  We did a recent recruitment process for staff for trade facilitation.  Advertisements closed in September and in excess of 3,000 people applied for the jobs.  We started the interview process and the top 40 will be hired from the panel.  We will continue the process of assessing, interviewing and hiring the new staff through the normal recruitment process.  <\/p> <p>  In the event of a change of plan, we would have to think about how more could be brought in more quickly, but we also have other resources.  One of the things we do in our organisation is redeploy, and we pride ourselves on having the flexibility to respond to events.  The key issue for our planning for whatever outcome of Brexit is to ensure the information and communications technology, ICT, infrastructure is in place to cope with multiples of customs entries if the UK becomes a third country.  <\/p> <p>  In budget 2017, following the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, provided for an additional &euro;2 million to improve our ICT development and have it in place because it is the key.  We used that money well and we are satisfied that we have scaled up our ICT infrastructure.

She is going down.  That is happening.  I would appreciate if Mr. Cody could be candid and tell us and, more important, the public the truth.

We are working on the basis, and the Government has worked on the basis, of this central case scenario, which involves an orderly agreement and a transition period.

If there is a no deal Brexit, then physical infrastructure will not be in place.  We would then have to look at how we would operate our systems.

Of the 8% that have some level of checking, 6% are orange routed.  That is a documentary check.  Then 2% are red routed which means that there is a check of the physical goods.  What happens, but what will have to happen to a greater degree in the future, is checks at approved premises.  The goods can be brought to the logistics company's warehouse and the check takes place away from the physical border.  Some companies will be approved customs operators so we will do checks away from the border.  I do not want people to go away saying that everything will be all right.

One of the chapters the Comptroller and Auditor General has examined in-depth is that of tobacco smuggling and the impact it has on the revenues of the State.  If a hard border is in place, then the smuggling of fuel, tobacco and drink will become even more lucrative.

First, in the context of illicit cigarette production and smuggling, the idea that Ireland is a discrete or isolated location, within which the availability of smuggled or illicit tobacco is a result of local criminal activity, is not the reality.  The production and smuggling of illicit tobacco is transnational.  It is a significant area of organised crime.  It involves a range of activities coming together in the sense that it is complex, organised, multi-layered and is undertaken by professional criminal enterprises.  It is also definitely linked, directly or indirectly, to other criminal activities.<\/p> <p>  In this case, we had three internationally-organised crime gangs involved from Bulgaria, Lithuania and Ireland.  They had come together to put a factory in place.  It was a full end-to-end professional factory in Jenkinstown and was unusual in that, under normal circumstances in Europe, the experience has been that we do not get a fully commercial end-to-end illicit factory in one place.<\/p><p>It is normally sectioned and kept in different locations, primarily because if law enforcement came across it, they would only lose one piece at a time.  The volume of tobacco on-site was 77 tonnes and the number of cigarettes produced was 22 million or 23 million.  This gives an indication of the size of the operation that was undertaken.  Not only is there the production of cigarettes and their distribution, all the precursors, as we call them - the tobacco, paper, filters, glue, cardboard, cellophane and all the aspects which have to come together to produce the final product - had to be transported to this location.  There were 11 people on-site 24 hours a day for the period involved, which we believe was for periods of up to two weeks, and they had the operation running 24-7.  They had shower facilities, kitchen facilities and accommodation facilities on-site in what, when one looks at it, appears to be a normal farm shed.  However, behind bales of hay, it was a professional and commercial factory.  Some of the international cigarette manufacturers who came to the site to have a look at it were surprised at how sophisticated the operation was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gilligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542272400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I again congratulate the Revenue Commissioners because it was a significant operation.

I am sure committee members hear the same views.  On the opposite side, as I said, the industry wrote to give out to me because the various retail interests and tobacco manufacturers keep emphasising the challenge of smuggling.<\/p> <p>  The standard increase in recent years has been 50 cent per pack of 20 in excise duty, which puts us at the highest end of the price.

This year we are well below the tobacco tax figures compared to forecast.  Because Ireland is a relatively small market, none of the cigarettes is manufactured in Ireland and it is not like it used to be.  The production of legitimate cigarettes for Ireland can be done in some of the factories in a couple of weeks in a quantity that will last months, and the releases then follow.

A total of 25 of the 83 individuals were family members who did not have an income but were included in the case base because they were part of the family group.  A total of 21 individuals were non-resident and non-domiciled; therefore, they were only subject to income tax on Irish sourced income or income remitted in Ireland.  They were included because they had significant links with Ireland, but they were not generating an income in Ireland.  A total of 22 high wealth individuals in taxpayer specific circumstances were impacted on significantly by the downturn.  This category would not have been significant if the crash had not happened in 2009 and 2010.  Some of them have ended up bankrupt and are no longer high wealth individuals.  However, some of them will recover.  A total of 15 high wealth individuals had a significant release of capital allowances or losses.

There are reliefs that are restricted if an individual's income is in excess of &euro;400,000 and he or she must at least pay at a 30% effective rate.  If relief is restricted in one year, he or she can carry forward the part that is unused; therefore, it is pent up.  It is like the lost relief discussions we had on corporation tax.

Some of them come in under that threshold.  A common feature of an artificial loss is when someone has a significant gain of &euro;10 million, for example, and he or she would be liable to pay capital gains tax of 33% on that in the normal course of events.  Some people try to create a loss to shelter the gain and a series of very sophisticated financial transactions would take place over a small number of days.  This would create a significant loss.  It would create another gain that was not legally taxable under a particular provision.  The person would shelter the real gain by means of the artificial loss.  The artificial loss and the artificial gain would cancel each other out and the individual would end up with exactly the same amount of money but would try to get it tax free.  We have challenged this and are now before the courts with some of the cases.   I cannot talk about individual cases but it is on public record that we identified 28 cases where the amount of tax at risk was &euro;110 million.  We were successful in the High Court but our approach was judicially reviewed.  It was appealed to the Supreme Court as a result of the judicial review.  A lot of the detail was put on the record of the court.  We have been successful in the Supreme Court, but that was dealing with the judicial review.  A number of the people involved have gone to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of the section on general anti-avoidance provision.  Those cases still have to go through the tax appeal process, but some have settled.  This was seven cases settled with a yield of &euro;27 million.  This is what we do and this is what the anti-avoidance teams do.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that the Chairman is very interested in the tax appeals process.  When we identify a tax avoidance scheme it could be ten years before the case is brought to fruition.  We might say it is tax avoidance but these people are very well resourced and very well advised.  They are quite happy to go through the courts process.  The prolonging of the payment may well be enough of an advantage for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1542272400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I have two more questions.

It would be useful to go back a little on the history.  We were one of the first administrations to have a HWI large cases division, LCD.  We were leaders in that regard.  We reviewed it in 2007 and in 2015.  We are now in the process of reviewing and realigning our structure.  I want to emphasise the fact that just because a person is dealt with in the HWI unit, or not, does not mean that the same rules and legal basis do not apply.  I spoke about the anti-avoidance process.  The anti-avoidance teams in the HWI LCD take in the cases that engage in the avoidance process that we have identified, to tackle that process.  We have some 1,240 cases of taxpayers who are involved in avoidance schemes that we are challenging.  The vast majority of those people are not HWIs at all, but they are being dealt with for the transaction by the anti-avoidance teams in the LCD.<\/p> <p>  I referred earlier to the Revenue's realignment process that is currently under way.  We are trying to do a serious realignment of resources with risk.  We have now divided LCD into LCD corporates and LCD HWI.  We have also set up a medium enterprise division that deals with the cases under the HWI threshold.  This division deals with 15,000 individuals and their tax affairs.  I have asked the two assistant secretaries who lead the HWI unit and the medium enterprise divisions that once we have settled down a bit of our resources in this quarter that by the end of the first quarter of next year they would bring forward a proposal to the board on the threshold for the HWIs.  I am absolutely confident that we will be reducing that threshold.  I want to put more resources into that area.  Identifying the resources and freeing up the resources from what they are currently doing is a process.  We are going through our structural realignment, motivated by ourselves, which involves a significant change in the structure of the organisation.  This will take time to bed in.  We are revisiting the threshold.  We want to see what will be the implications of, for example, a &euro;20 million threshold and how many cases this would involve.  All of those cases are being dealt with by the medium enterprise division.

According to the figures the witnesses say are based on the 2017 survey, the nominal loss to the Exchequer in 2017 was &euro;229 million.  I am reading from Mr. Cody's opening statement.  In regard to following these matters up, two paragraphs later Mr. Cody writes that prosecutions have resulted in fines totalling &euro;140,250.  It must be the most profitable business in Ireland.  I will talk about the detection rates in a moment.  I have worked out that for every euro a person has paid in a fine, on average he or she has been involved in &euro;1,632 worth of illicit tobacco.  That is like winning the lottery every morning.  For the risk of being fined &euro;1 one can make &euro;1,632.  I find that a phenomenally low figure relative to the money that can be made.  Mr. Cody can see where I get these figures.<\/p> <p>  Somebody got a sentence of six months, I am sure with probation attached, a reduction in time or whatever.  Revenue cannot set the terms.  That is up to us.  As far as I can see, however, there is zero deterrent.  Someone can sell &euro;1,632 worth of illicit tobacco, and if he or she is one of those caught he or she will pay an average of &euro;1 in fines.  One person involved in that &euro;229 million worth of business got a short prison sentence.  I know about the price differential, the tax and how cheap they are in Europe, but this also has something to do with the extent of smuggling.  Is there anything more Revenue can do, or does it need more power?  It might require legislation.  That disparity speaks volumes.  Looking at the facts, I have never seen anything as profitable as smuggling cigarettes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018111500002#Y01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542272400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>In some of the big tobacco seizures we do not have a person but a container.

It is all well and good publishing the report but in regard to the reliefs claimed, by far the biggest one is the &euro;98 million for the reliefs carried forward, which we have discussed.  In regard to the other big reliefs being utilised, 27 people claimed relief on hotels, holiday camps and cottages of &euro;7.6 million, which was an average of &euro;280,000 relief per person.  In regard to the urban renewal scheme and capital allowances for commercial buildings, 14 people claimed reliefs of &euro;1.6 million, which is an average of &euro;115,000 per individual.  In regard section 344 and multi-storey carpark allowances, this is a very lucrative allowance for some people.  Fewer than ten people claimed reliefs of &euro;3.6 million.  If there were ten of them, it would have been relief of &euro;360,000 per person.  If it was five, it would have been double that.  We do not have the figure but it is at least &euro;360,000 per individual.  In regard to section 372, qualifying urban relief and capital allowances for certain commercial buildings, 15 people claimed reliefs of &euro;2.15 million, which is an average relief of &euro;143,000 per person.  I am only listing those over &euro;100,000 because people ought to hear about reliefs.  I want to put what we are talking about on the record.  Section 372 relief applies for lessors of residential properties - it is a section 23-type relief - and 54 people claimed &euro;11.5 million in reliefs, which is an average of &euro;214,000 per individual.  Section 338 is relief arising under terminal losses of a business totalling &euro;7.1 million, which is an average of &euro;160,000 relief per individual.<\/p><p> I have mentioned the big one already, namely, losses forward.  Some 346 people claimed relief for losses forward of &euro;98 million, which is an average of &euro;383,000 relief per individual.

I took the view that those types of rules were predictable and did not happen overnight.  Mr. Cody said in his correspondence that there was a significant change for the telecommunications and software sectors, where long-term contracts are complex and arrangements are prevalent as to when they record their income.
