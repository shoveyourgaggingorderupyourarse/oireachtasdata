I think this is his first time before Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I congratulate him on his appointment to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I know a lot about his work and his track record in this area.  We have a particularly good Minister of State, who has shown a particular gr&aacute; for and interest in heritage for many years.  I wish him well in the task ahead of him.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the national peatlands strategy and the issue of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  I understand that the preservation and restoration of peatlands is part of the country's climate action strategy.  I congratulate the Minister of State and his party on the work that has been done on that.  I know the climate action Bill is to be published in the coming days.  I understand that and that Deputy Noonan is a Minister of State with excellent green credentials.  However, I also understand the importance of peat in the horticultural industry.  We had a long debate about forestry.  We know that horticultural peat is of critical importance to the use of nursery stock in the forestry sector, where it is used widely.  The long-term plan to phase out the commercial use of peat moss in the horticultural industry, as opposed to domestic horticulture and gardening, is of concern to me and many of the growers and participants in the commercial sector.<\/p> <p>I refer particularly to forestry nursery stock and mushroom production.  It is critical in the production of mushrooms.  We have a very successful mushroom production arrangement.  Believe it or not, we fly mushrooms to France from our airports.  Mushrooms that were in Ireland two days ago are sitting on shelves in Paris, London and all over the world.  We have a track record in this product.  That is important.  Peat moss is also used in organic gardening and horticulture.  <\/p> <p>This will also have a knock-on effect on jobs.  That debate was cleverly played out in the forestry sector.  I understand that concern.  A balance must always be struck.  I am really concerned.  The curtailment of peat production will have an impact on Bord na M&oacute;na and more importantly on the communities, villages and people who derive their principal income from this work.  They must have alternative employment.<\/p> <p>Then there is the aspect which I really invited the Minister of State to the House to discuss.  We need more research and more time.  Phasing out peat moss will be a process.  We talk about a just transition, but that takes time.  We cannot just cut off the supply of horticultural peat moss until a new alternative such as wood bark or wood chippings is available.  Substitutes are being trialled but the trials are not complete.  That is an important factor.  I am interested in hearing about where the national peatlands strategy is today.  What are the Minister of State's plans?  Does he see an argument for making this change on a phased basis?  I am conscious of where the Minister of State is coming from and his green credentials.  I just want to emphasise the importance of the horticulture industry to jobs, food production and the continuous supply of peat to the mushroom sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#B00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It is a great privilege to make my first address to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in reply to Senator Boyhan.  He and I go back a long way in politics.  I congratulate Senator Mark Daly on his election as Cathaoirleach.  It is a great honour for the Senator and his family and recognises his long and dedicated work in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this important issue, on which he and I have engaged on numerous occasions.  This morning I was chairing the inter-agency group on the Drumkeeran landslide, which addressed that tragic incident in County Leitrim.  We are making good progress in that regard.  This feeds into the national peatlands strategy, as the Senator rightly said, and the efforts to find alternative employment and sources of income for midlands peat workers as part of a just transition.  Good progress has been made in that regard, but there is no doubt that this element is significant to the horticulture sector.  As Senator Boyhan has said, we want to deal with it in a manner that is sustainable, equitable and fair to workers in the industry. <\/p> <p>The national peatlands strategy sets out a cross-governmental approach to managing issues relating to peatlands, including compliance with EU environmental law, climate change, forestry, flood control, energy, nature conservation, planning and agriculture.  It is comprises 25 principles and 32 actions to be implemented by a range of Departments, Government agencies and semi-State bodies. <\/p> <p>The peatlands strategy implementation group has a role in co-ordinating and reporting to Government on the implementation of the national peatlands strategy.  This is a cross-departmental group which shares an independent chair with the Irish Peatland Conservation Council.  It prepares progress reports on the implementation of actions under the strategy, which require Government approval prior to publication.  A mid-term review of the national peatlands strategy is currently being led by my Department.  This review is intended to assess the overall direction of the strategy and to ensure it remains focused on achieving its intended outcomes.  Subject to the approval of the Government, I intend to publish a mid-term review document for public consultation, taking into account the views of the peatlands strategy implementation group and of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council. <\/p> <p>Action 5 of the national peatlands strategy provides for a review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  A working group comprised of representatives from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Environmental Protection Agency was established to undertake the review.  Under the auspices of the working group, a key issues paper in relation to the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry was published in 2019 and the public was invited to make submissions by the end or January this year.  Some 34 submissions were received from a range of individuals in the environmental sector, industry and advisory bodies. <\/p> <p>Last month I published a report on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  The review report was prepared by the inter-agency working group following the receipt of submissions in response to publication of the key issues paper.  The review report notes that significant positives and negatives arise from ending the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry, as the Senator rightly pointed out.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are difficult choices to be made, from how we garden as individuals to the economic and cultural impacts arising from any significant changes.  As a result, I propose to establish a working group, the membership of which will include representatives from relevant Departments and State agencies, NGOs and industry stakeholders and which will operate under an independent chairperson, to examine the issues that were identified during the review, including the need for investment in further research into the development, education and use of alternatives to peat moss, such as bark, wood fibre, biosolids, bracken and green compost, perlite, vermiculite, rockwool and horticultural clay.  The Senator will be aware of these alternatives.<\/p><p>This week, my Department is set to advertise in the national newspapers for expressions of interest in the position of chairperson of the working group.  Once the chairperson is in place, invitations will be issued to participate in the working group.  The chairperson will not have an easy task, given the different and disparate views that have been expressed on ending the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  I hope the working group will endeavour to chart a fair and sustainable path forward, taking into account the impact any changes would have on individuals, industry, local economies and the environmental consequences for the country as a whole.  I encourage all those who participate in the group to endeavour to engage in a constructive debate and in an open, fair and effective fashion.  I expect the chairperson to issue recommendations to me arising from the deliberations of the working group within a reasonable period once it is established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#B00500","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Before I call the Senator, I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.

If we have a policy in respect of peat and milling peat in our jurisdiction, then we have to be consistent and to stand in solidarity, if that is the right word to use, across the member states of the Union.  That is something the Minister of State might raise initially with the working group because we need to ascertain what level of commercial peat is coming into the various ports of the country.

I wish him well.  I hope he will be a font of fresh and new thinking in regard to this key issue.<\/p><p>I want to start with some quotations from childcare workers.  The first reads as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI hope to leave my service in the next month.  I will try one last service and if I am still unhappy, I will leave childcare.  I have an honours degree and have worked in three places in the last three years in search of decent working conditions.  I worked in a petrol station for nine years previously and was on better pay. <\/blockquote> <p>The second reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI hope to leave the sector.  I cannot see any change coming.  I am working longer hours for less pay.  <\/blockquote> <p>The next reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe employers are given grants to support the opening of businesses but staff get nothing, as usual.  <\/blockquote> <p>In fairness, the Minister is already aware that the childcare sector is in crisis.  We know that, for parents, the service is too expensive, for the workers involved, the levels of pay are just too low, and for the childcare providers, there is very little money to be made in the sector, which is fundamentally broken.  Sinn F&eacute;in unveiled its own policy for a fundamental transformation of childcare towards a fully State-funded model earlier this week.  This morning, I want to hone in on two crucial issues for this upcoming budget: the first is pay and the second is provision for sick pay for these childcare workers.<\/p><p>It seems quite a long time ago now, but it was only February when 30,000 people marched outside of this building in respect of childcare, such was the depth of feeling, anger and despair, coupled with hope that someone this time would listen.  There is no question that staff retention is a key issue and, indeed, it is mentioned in the programme for government.  Just to make clear how bad the situation is, there is a 40% attrition rate in full day-care services, which means four out of ten workers leave the service each year.  We cannot build a childcare service on that basis.  We cannot build a childcare service on the basis of an average rate of pay of &euro;11.46 an hour, with many childcare workers being paid just the minimum wage or barely above.  It is not sustainable.  Some 79% do not have a sick pay scheme.  These figures come from the Pobal annual survey, so there is no doubt regarding the validation of these points.  They need proper pay and a living wage, and they also need provision for sick pay.<\/p><p>This is an issue that is personal to me because, before taking this job, I worked as a SIPTU official trying to organise childcare workers.  The Minister can imagine my shock when I found that thousands of them actually have to sign on each summer for unemployment payments.  That is no way to treat these workers; it is no way to treat the sector. <\/p><p>There are two simple asks.  First, I ask that the Minister would introduce a living wage guarantee.  Ring-fenced funding is important because, while, to be fair, previous Governments increased funding, it is still way below where it should be at 25% of the European average.  When funding has been increased, it has not reached its way to the pay packets of those workers, which, again, feeds into the cycle of people leaving.  A survey by SIPTU earlier this year showed that only one third of graduates in this area intend to work in the sector.  We need decent funding, a living wage guarantee and sick pay provision.  A five-day sick pay provision would cost just &euro;6 million and it would cost &euro;30 million for a living wage guarantee.<\/p><p>I hope we will see new thinking, new proposals and a real commitment to these workers in next week's budget.  I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#C00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising an issue that is of real concern to me.  I acknowledge that there is a need for significant improvement in levels of pay and working conditions for practitioners working in early learning and care and school-age childcare services.  The level of pay they receive at the moment does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society.  In addition, low pay and poor working conditions have an impact on the quality of the childcare provided through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff.  The quotations highlighted by the Senator illustrate this well.<\/p> <p>As the Senator knows, the State is not the employer.  These services are private businesses and my Department does not pay the wages of staff who work in early learning and care services, and does not determine the working conditions for staff, including sick pay.  My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions in the sector.  These supports have included: year-on-year increases in State funding for service providers; higher capitation payments for graduates and inclusion co-ordinators working in the sector; support for school-age childcare, which will make it easier for providers to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to support continuing professional development.<\/p> <p>The most recent data on pay and conditions, as of May 2019, indicates that the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare is &euro;12.55, which was a 3% increase on the previous year and is higher than the national living wage of &euro;12.30.  However, I accept there is wide variation in wages in the sector, and approximately 60% of early learning and care practitioners in 2019 earned less than &euro;12.30 per hour, the living wage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Senator said, many of them work part-time and are on temporary contracts.  I am still awaiting the 2020 data on wages, which should be available from the annual Pobal early years sector profile.  However, I agree with the Senator that the wages in the sector are still too low.  In the medium term, the expert group on the new funding model and the steering group of the workforce development plan are both considering future policy tools that will impact on the workforce in early learning and care and school age childcare services.  The new funding model is looking at ways in which some services can be funded to meet additional requirements on the quality, affordability and accessibility of services.  These could include requirements in relation to wages or working conditions.<\/p><p>In the short term, the programme for Government includes a commitment to the creation of a joint labour committee, which could offer a mechanism through which a pay agreement for the sector could be achieved.  Soon after I was appointed, I met with the Senator's former colleagues in SIPTU and we discussed this issue.  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with SIPTU representatives on the issue.<\/p><p>The Senator may be aware that on the employer side, Childhood Services Ireland, under the auspices of IBEC, has been formed.  I welcome this development as it is good to have a clear voice on the employer side and on the trade union side through SIPTU to enable us to advance matters through the mechanism of a joint labour committee.  I am happy to support both sides in any way I can in doing so.<\/p><p>I am aware that many childcare professionals do not benefit from a sick pay scheme at the moment.  I had a meeting last week with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and this was one of the issues we discussed.  At that meeting ICTU noted that the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation are working on proposals to address the wider lack of sick pay across the economy.  This is something that I welcome, and my Department is engaging with the T&aacute;naiste's officials with a view to including childcare professionals within any national scheme.<\/p><p>I am grateful to the Senator for allowing me to update this House on the steps being taken to advance these two important issues for childcare professionals.  I will continue to work with the sector to advance them.  I am happy to come back to the House to speak to these issues as we move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#C00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

We need to see ICTU play a key role in addressing these two key issues and I know it is willing to do so.<\/p> <p>I refer to the issue of pay.  It should be clarified that the most common position is that of early years assistant, and the average wage of that post, according to 2020 data which I have seen, is &euro;11.46 per hour.  Indeed, the Minister has acknowledged that 60% of people earn below that living wage.<\/p> <p>I wish to challenge the Minister on one key point.  He has said that the State is not the employer, but the fact of the matter is that his Department determines 60% of funding, not just in terms of wages, but in terms of the overall sector as a whole.  That gives the Minister a fundamental say because the service could not exist without this crucial departmental support.  I put it to the Minister that he must go beyond what the civil servants are telling him, and work for that living wage guarantee.  It can be done and it needs the political will to do so.  The sector will buy into it if it comes from the Minister.  I hope that in the time between now and the announcement of the budget next Tuesday, the Minister will reflect on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#D00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>As regards the overall funding of the sector, I am focused on the report of the expert funding group.

When we have those three key pieces of information, we can make major decisions at that point about the future of childcare.

More importantly, from that card flows an exemption from the payment of VAT, motor tax and vehicle registration fees, as well as various reliefs that assist in the purchase or adaptation of a car for people who are drivers with disabilities, or who have a passenger with a disability.<\/p> <p>The eligibility criteria, as they stand, are based on the medical grounds of disability for people who are severely or permanently disabled.  Assessment is made with reference to a particular set of criteria, including the loss of both legs, restricted use of lower limbs or the loss of both hands or arms.  Those who are not taken into account include people who have lost one upper limb or have a severe debilitating or life-changing disability and are falling short of meeting the criteria.  The constituent to whom I previously referred had an appalling accident when she was in her 20s.  She is now a number of decades older.  She did not receive any compensation at the time, in the circumstances arising from the accident, but she has lost one arm.  This affects her washing, dressing, typing, managing her phone, toileting and driving.  She has to pay for all the adaptations made to the car herself.  She gets no relief from the State in this regard because she does not fit any of the criteria.  Every minute of every day, she is reminded of her disability in an ambidextrous world.<\/p> <p>The qualifying criteria, as currently prescribed in legislation, are far too stringent.  They require a level of disability that appears to be deliberately designed to ensure exclusion.  Where is the compassion for those who have lost one arm?  In this particular constituent's case, it was the result of an accident, but in subsequent representations made to me by others, the disabilities have arisen from cancer and the treatment of same.  Therefore, there is a wide group of people included in this cohort.<\/p> <p>Since I submitted this Commencement matter, I have done some research.  It appears that this issue has been raised frequently in the Seanad and in parliamentary questions, especially over the last decade.  I note that a review was last undertaken in 2011.  The response is always that to widen the criteria would open the floodgates to payments.  As the Minister of State is smiling, I anticipate that I am about to get the same response.<\/p> <p>I ask for consideration to be given to the introduction of a graduated relief system, which would provide for differing degrees of disability that entitle claimants to differing levels of relief.  This would demonstrate compassion, without opening prohibitive floodgates.  The situation as it stands at the moment is far too stark and is devoid of empathy.  It is not supportive or cognisant of the very real and genuine impairments that are experienced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#D00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Before I start, I wish to congratulate Leas-Chathaoirleach on his appointment.

She has made her points very well in relation to this issue, which has been raised on many occasions in both Houses.  I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, who is unavailable this morning.<\/p> <p>The disabled parking scheme operates by segregating a proportion of public parking bays for the use of disabled parking permit holders.  These permits, which are also known as European parking cards or disabled parking badges, are available to people living in Ireland whose mobility is severely and permanently restricted, whether they are drivers or passengers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The intention of the permit, and of the disabled parking scheme more generally, is to provide access to parking bays of sufficient size in close proximity to important services such as post offices, banks, pharmacies and shops for people for whom access to such services would be denied if they could not park and disembark, either because of the size of a parking bay or because they could not park within a short distance of a service due to their limited mobility.<\/p><p>An automatic entitlement to a disabled parking permit is extended to holders of the primary medical certificate, including those who are affected by dwarfism or restricted growth, those without the use of one or both legs, and those without both hands or both arms.  The Senator has raised the case of her constituent who has lost one limb.  The criteria there are quite clear and stark that the entitlement applies to those without the use of one or both legs and those without both hands or both arms.  This entitlement is granted on the grounds that each of the disabilities encompassed by the primary medical certificate clearly involves a severe impairment of the ability to walk as a result of compromised or absent lower limbs in some cases, or severely disrupted balance in the case of those missing both arms.  The permit is also available to applicants who are registered as blind with the National Council for the Blind in Ireland, so as to minimise their interaction with motor traffic and maximise their safety in navigating from a parking space to the entrance of their destination.<\/p><p>In 2010, the Department of Transport conducted a review of the disabled parking scheme, in consultation with various stakeholders.  One of the central issues examined in the course of this review was eligibility for the scheme.  Disability groups, in particular, were unhappy at the fact that some people were being issued with disabled parking permits because they had particular medical conditions rather than an actual mobility impairment.  As a result of the review, the scheme was revised so that permits are now given on the basis of mobility impairment rather than the diagnosis of a particular condition or illness.  This is in line with the original intention of the scheme and prioritises accessible parking for those who need it the most.<\/p><p>The possibility of extending the eligibility criteria for the scheme to include people with non-mobility-related physical disabilities, or those with certain forms of intellectual or cognitive impairment, has been raised with the Department of Transport on a number of occasions.  Officials from the Department have consulted extensively with the joint issuing authorities of the scheme, the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association, on the matter.  In light of this consultation, there are no plans at present to change the current criteria or to carry out a fresh review to that end.<\/p><p>I take on board what the Senator has said about graduated or different stages of relief for different degrees of disability and I will bring that point back to the Minister, as well as her point about people missing one limb.  She made the point very well and it is an issue I have come across in my own constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#D00700","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I appreciate and hear that the Minister of State recognises the challenge.  What we are really honing in on are the qualifying criteria for the primary medical certificate.  I accept the need to confine the parking permit to people with genuine mobility issues.  I get that link and the point was very well made.  However, the parking permit is inextricably linked to the adaptation of cars for driving purposes and the grant aid for that.  Consequently, if a person is missing one upper limb he or she still has to adapt a car.  Such people may be able to walk the distance to shopping or work but they still have to incur the expenditure and we need to address that element more so than the criteria.  We need to decouple those aspects from each other and circle that in red.  I had considered that this might be a matter for the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte.  I will pursue it with her as well but I appreciate the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#E00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I assure the Senator that the Department of Transport is very aware of the complex challenges facing the various groups she mentioned today, whether people with physical disabilities that do not directly affect mobility or people with autism or intellectual disabilities and their parents and carers.

It is good to see her in the House.  I thank her for the opportunity to raise this issue, which many people have been contacting me about in recent days and weeks.  Indeed, many of my colleagues across all parties have been raising it as well.  I must stress the disbelief I felt when I heard that the Covid centre in Dundalk was to close and that Ardee was to become the testing hub for Louth.  The county has the two largest towns in the country and neither town will have a Covid testing centre.  This comes at a time when the electoral area of Dundalk-Carlingford has, unfortunately, one of the highest rates of Covid in the country, with a 14-day average of 132 per 100,000.  The HSE has closed the testing centre in Muirhevnamor in Dundalk and the new testing centre will be located in St. Brigid's in Ardee, which is 25 km away.  To me and most of the population in north Louth, this does not make any sense.  According to a recent statement issued by the HSE, the move is due to an assessment of locations undertaken as part of the HSE test and trace operational model.  Ardee was found to best meet the criteria for a testing centre in Louth as travel times from both Dundalk and Drogheda are less than 25 minutes.  I feel the rationale the HSE is using is very narrow.<\/p> <p>I absolutely accept the HSE's assertion that the hospital in Ardee will provide fit-for-purpose facilities and when fully operational will provide increased capacity.  It will be a great service for the geographical area it practically serves.  However, this new location will mean that people from Dundalk and north Louth will have to travel further if they are referred for testing.  Someone living in Omeath in north County Louth will have to make a round trip of over 90 km.  When we are supposed to be limiting our movements and contacts, it does not really make sense for the HSE to send people on a 90 km trip.  A person from north Louth going to Ardee might need to take a toilet break, for example, and will use public facilities, possibly putting other people at risk.  The people of Dundalk, who could have gone to a testing centre minutes from their homes, are now travelling with symptoms to Ardee, a town with low numbers of Covid cases and a 14-day average of 27.6 per 100,000.  While the testing centre is welcome for Ardee and its surrounds, it is impractical for the citizens of north Louth, especially considering the high incidence of cases in north Louth.<\/p> <p>It often seems that the Border region and Border towns are overlooked and this has to end.  The Border has been there for 100 years now and it is time to remember these inhabitants.  We have problems with many health services.  It could take eight hours to get an ambulance to north Louth as well.  This lack of thought regarding the location of the Border needs to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#E00500","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I thank the Senator for asking this particular question.  As today is our first day since the whole country entered into level 3, it is very timely.  A comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation is central to our public health strategy for containing and slowing the spread of Covid-19.  Capacity is in place to test 15,000 people a day and overall the system is working well.  Rigorous contact tracing, automatic testing of close contacts, serial testing in high-risk environments and large-scale testing in outbreak situations means we are proactively finding more cases than we would have previously.  In recent weeks, we have increased resources significantly as demand has increased.  We are testing more people than ever before, especially in the community, with over 93,000 people swabbed in the last week.  This included the opening of additional community testing centres and mobile pop-up testing units, significantly increased contact tracing teams and increased laboratory testing.<\/p> <p>A new static testing and swabbing centre in Ardee commenced operations yesterday, 6 October, and together with the facility in Slane is offering test appointments to members of the public from Louth and Meath seven days a week.  Combined, they offer in excess of 750 appointments daily.  The Ardee centre replaces the previous temporary centre in Dundalk.  Ardee is the default location for appointments for those referred from Louth.  If there are capacity issues in Ardee, the centre in Slane will come into play.  However, capacity in Ardee will ultimately be approximately 50% higher than the previous Dundalk facility so it is not forecast that this will happen.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The HSE advises that current demand nationally and also in the Louth and Meath centres is being met and at present there are no plans for a pop-up testing centre in Drogheda.  However, referral demand in any area is subject to ongoing review by the HSE and evaluation against available capacity.  This includes actions such as extending opening hours and adding testing stations to existing sites.<\/p><p>The increased capacity in Louth is a clear example of the response to demand being actioned.  For example on 16 September, 761 appointments were offered across the two Louth and Meath facilities, whereas two weeks previously, those centres offered a combined 450 appointments per day, approximately.  In the last seven days in the entire CHO 8 area, 57% of referrals were offered a same-day appointment with a further 40% getting an appointment the next day.  This represents a median time of six hours from referral to appointment.<\/p><p>The HSE is now finalising a future model for testing and tracing.  This will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service.  It includes recruitment of a permanent workforce which has already commenced and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out quickly.  Transition to the new model is under way and will continue through the autumn.  As part of this transition a comprehensive assessment of community testing and swabbing locations is being undertaken by the HSE.  The executive is examining the suitability and sustainability of the locations as long-term testing centres as well as travel times to test centres.<\/p><p>I take on board the points Senator McGreehan made about people travelling, with some facing a 90 km round trip to certain facilities.  The HSE is constantly seeking to improve the responsiveness of the testing and tracing system and will keep demand and capacity under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#E00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I accept that there has been a great increase in the availability of testing.

She has been a most frequent visitor since the Seanad reconvened and she was appointed to her position.  I know of her compassion for older people.  In her past life as a Deputy she was co-chairman of the all-party committee on dementia and did incredible work on the issue.  We could not have anybody more suited to the position she now occupies.<\/p> <p>As 1 October was International Day for Older Persons, I felt it was appropriate to table a Commencement matter on the issue of people dealing with dementia.  My concern is not just for people with dementia but also those who care for them.  There are approximately 66,000 people in this country with dementia and for every one of those people there are at least three others impacted as carers.  We are talking here about mothers, fathers, grandparents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, neighbours and friends.  There is no community that is not impacted by dementia.  Things were difficult for these people before Covid-19 but the pandemic has totally exacerbated the challenges that people with dementia and their carers face.  <\/p> <p>Two reports were commissioned by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in April and late June to assess the impact of Covid-19 and the results are frightening.  The surveys were carried out among carers and those with dementia.  Following on from that, the society launched its pre-budget submission for 2021.  A number of Members of the Oireachtas attended the launch.  Carers were represented by a woman called Denise.  To hear her speaking about carers being at breaking point and outlining the long-term impacts from both a mental and physical perspective would draw a tear from a stone.  A man called Kevin who has dementia also spoke.  I know that the Minister of State has spoken to him previously but listening to his concern, not just for himself but for his wife and those around him, was incredibly touching.  However, these people need more than sympathy; they need support.  First, we need to talk about the commencement of day services.  I accept that today is day one of level 3 restrictions nationwide but that pushes the recommencement of services out even further.  We need to support family carers in their own homes through enhanced in-home supports.  Additional funding must be provided in the budget for appropriate homecare and for additional dementia carers.  I thank the Minister of State for her efforts to ensure that there will be ten additional dementia advisors, bringing the total to 19.  However, I would argue that every county should have a dementia advisor.  We also need extra funding for infrastructure for those with dementia.  They need joy in their lives which is made possible through social interaction with their peers.  The same is true of their carers.  They need an opportunity to have time for themselves, as do other family members.  These are three key areas that must be addressed in the upcoming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#F00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising this matter.

I recently convened a round table discussion with carers.  Unfortunately we had to conduct it online and reduce the numbers involved but I specifically asked to speak to people caring for people with dementia and mental health challenges and particularly to people who were full-time carers and did not work outside the home.  To be honest, listening to them was very hard.  Their stories were very stark and there is no doubt that carers have really been challenged in the last six to seven months.  The Covid-19 restrictions have meant that many carers are spending the whole day at home.  Every single one of us, as representatives of our constituents in both Houses of the Oireachtas, are acutely aware of that.  We also know that community services such as day care play an important role in enabling older people to continue to live in their communities and maintain their social connections.  These services contribute to positive ageing and better overall health.  However, the introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamics of social interaction.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The suspension of day services has been particularly difficult for people living with dementia and their family carers, whose usual routines have been disrupted.  Against this background, the HSE is continuing to work closely with providers and community staff to identify where service is most required.  It has also been undertaking risk assessments of local services.  This is to ensure, insofar as possible, that day care services can resume in the context of Covid-19 and having regard to public health advice.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department and the HSE have ensured that there has been a continued focus on the needs of people living with dementia since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Through the HSE's \"Understand Together\" campaign on dementia, a range of initiatives and resources have been developed.  Community services have been adapted to provide a flexible response that meets the needs of people with dementia during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Referrals are being made to community supports, including the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, ASI, which does phenomenal work, a dementia adviser service and the local authority community response forums.<\/p><p>A majority of the HSE's memory technology resource rooms are now providing an adapted service through telephone and video assessment and consultation.  While home visits have, of necessity, been restricted, the HSE uses prioritisation and screening measures to identify clients in need of home visits.<\/p><p>My Department and the HSE are undertaking work to determine the current level of service delivery in the community and to set out plans, which will include the required associated capacity, to resume services, including day services, in line with the roadmap for reopening society and business. <\/p><p>In addition, the ASI continues to support people through its live chat service, national helpline, home care, dementia adviser service and online family carer training.  Alzheimer cafes have moved online and a new nurse line initiative has been launched with backing from the HSE and my Department.  This gives people with dementia and family carers the opportunity to book a one-to-one session with a dementia nurse or a dementia adviser.<\/p><p>I also welcome the fact that the HSE's winter plan includes provision for a targeted work programme to double the existing home support hours in order to fully support those with high and moderate levels of frailty, including people living with dementia.  The winter plan also provides funding to enable the recruitment of ten dementia advisers, which will bring the total number of dementia advisers to 28.  As we headed into the budget last year, and for many years previously, we had eight such advisers.  We finally made a breakthrough last year and secured ten.  The additional ten to be recruited will bring the number to 20.

We have to bear that in mind, as I know the Minister of State does.  In my own county of Kildare, almost 1,500 people have dementia.  We also have almost 4,000 carers.  Over the past six years, day care support services have moved to four different places.  The day care service in Monasterevin moved to Moore Abbey, then to Dunmurry and then on to Mill Lane in Naas in north Kildare.  I have been to Dunmurry and Moore Abbey and have seen how wonderful these spaces were for those who were there.

The supports will, of course, also be offered to people with dementia.  In addition, more than &euro;6 million in dormant accounts funding has been secured since 2016 for a range of dementia-related project as part of the process of implementing the national dementia strategy.<\/p> <p>Dementia has a prominent place in the programme for Government but I am also committed to ensuring that people with dementia can access the right services and supports to enable them to continue living in their own communities.  It is an appropriate time for the Senator to raise this issue as I was in budget talks yesterday and this issue was discussed in the context of the Estimates.  I am acutely aware of the challenges involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#G00400","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","time":1602063000,"counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#G00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I speak today on behalf of the people of the mid-west including those in Limerick, Tipperary and, particularly, Clare.  Clare is a county which I know well.  It has a population of approximately 110,000 people.  The problem is that, for the last number of years, the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick in Dooradoyle has been constantly overcrowded, particularly during the winter months.  Last year was one of the worst years for crowding at the hospital's accident and emergency department.  At one point, the figures ranged from 80 to almost 100.  Many of these people are elderly, vulnerable and extremely sick.  They are left on trolleys while waiting for a bed in the hospital.  It goes without saying that, once they get a bed in the hospital, they are treated very well and the care offered to them is exemplary.  The problem is that they are waiting on trolleys on corridors and around the vicinity of the accident and emergency unit in very challenging and very difficult circumstances.  I am sure the Minister will agree that is not acceptable in this world or in this country.<\/p> <p>In November 2017, the then Minister, Deputy Harris, committed funding for the University of Limerick Hospital Group to build a 60-bed modular unit as a starting point to deal with the difficulties at the accident and emergency facility in the hospital in Limerick.  That money was sanctioned, made available and ring-fenced.  The years 2018 and 2019 have passed and 2020 is about to pass but the unit is still not up and running.  Three years is a long time.  A significant amount of facilities could be built in three years.  The delay is completely unacceptable.  Will the Minister of State confirm the date on which the new 60-bed modular unit will be up and running and when patients will be able to avail of it?  The delay is totally unacceptable.  I look forward to getting a specific date for when the unit at Limerick hospital will open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#G00500","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his question.

The 60 single rooms will improve patient comfort, safety, privacy and dignity, and assist with the management of infection control in the hospital.  The additional 60 beds will also directly increase bed capacity, allowing patients access to an increased overall bed stock and improve patient flow across the hospital.  The nub of the Senator's question is on timelines and the 60-bed ward block at University Hospital Limerick is expected to be completed by 30 October 2020.

The first is the issue of Brexit.  This morning, we engaged extensively with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  While there was a good engagement and a good update on negotiations, the situation is quite precarious and we are in a very vulnerable position.  It seems the two key issues preventing a deal being done are the areas of fishing rights and level playing field provisions.  The very clear message this morning was that if agreement could not be reached on those two areas, there would not be a full free trade arrangement come January.  It is difficult to see how those two issues could be overcome in a very short period.  It is incumbent on this House to do as much as we can to prepare for what might be coming down the tracks in January, and to do our best to work with citizens across the board to make sure they are as informed as they can be.<\/p> <p>Second, I wish to raise the results of the national maternity experience survey, which I am sure Members will find very interesting.  It is the first survey of its kind and it spoke directly to women about their experiences in maternity hospitals across the country.  The national average is that 85% of women reported either a good or very good experience and 15% reported a poor experience.  I think we would all agree that 15% is far too high but more worrying for me was that while the national average for a poor experience was 15%, in Mayo it was 26%.  This means that one in four women surveyed who went through the maternity services in Mayo University Hospital had a very poor experience.  We need to address this, and the only way we can address it is to have more midwives and a midwifery-led service.  One of the lowest scoring questions was around the area of consulting women about their care during labour and after birth, and it was clear they felt they were not properly listened to and that time was not made to care for them.  In this day and age, in 2020, this is something we need to get to grips with in order to improve our maternity services. <\/p> <p>Third, I want to raise the level 3 restrictions that have come into place across the country, with every other county now joining Dublin and Donegal.  We would all accept it is a very severe restriction on businesses but it is to try to protect public health, lives and livelihoods.  I fully agree with the Government's decision not to go to level 5, which would have been far too much far too quickly, and I very much approve of the fact we are giving every county a chance to bring those numbers down.  My own county of Mayo has the lowest incidence rate in the past 14 days and the county had the least number of infections.  Understandably, therefore, businesses in Mayo are really feeling this and are rightly asking why we do not have a more focused and more regional approach.  After this point, we should perhaps look at a more targeted, regionalised approach so that counties with a very low incidence rate can keep businesses open.  As I said, I very much support the Government decision to just go to level 3 and not beyond. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#K00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>On the point made by Senator Chambers, I do not support the attack by the T&aacute;naiste on NPHET recently.  It was a very individualistic approach that he took, and the thought struck me that if they do business like that, perhaps they will not be doing business very long, either as a Government or in terms of the Government's relationship with NPHET.<\/p> <p>I see nothing wrong with NPHET communicating its ideas directly to the Irish people.  I do not think the Government has a right to expect that it must find out everything first, so it can measure out what exactly the people are being told.  People are intelligent and they are entitled to witness the tensions and the different strands of opinion that go to the formation of decisions around the restrictions we all have to face together.  There are economic and social as well as health issues, but people are entitled to know that.  The Government has no right to expect NPHET can only speak through it, or to suggest there is some sort of failure on NPHET&rsquo;s part to communicate properly, simply because it communicates something directly to the people.<\/p> <p>For the foreseeable future and until such time that we can be sure our hospitals will not be overwhelmed, I support the restrictions we have to face and I think there has to be a presumption in favour of the recommendations made by NPHET and our health advisers.  That said, I do question the lack of discernment and refinement around the restrictions being placed in the area of public worship.  It is fair to say that the people who attend churches primarily are a demographic who are highly compliant and mainly, but not exclusively, older people.  Most of us have probably been in churches and will have seen the remarkable attention to detail in terms of sanitising before and after services, and the stewarding of people to ensure that traffic is one-way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If everybody was as good at observing the restrictions as churches across the board and those attending them have been, we would not be facing the challenges we currently face.

There must be a rethink in that regard.<\/p><p>I am troubled by the line coming from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the 132 permanent static checkpoints being erected on roads across the State.  I support having checkpoints at which people are asked where they are going and why.  However, it is another thing entirely for checkpoints to be used as a means of delaying and obstructing people.  That hits people who have a legitimate reason for travelling as much as it hits those who do not.  It is wrong to use garda&iacute; to discourage or obstruct people going about their business.  Such action hits everybody and it is being done in an extremely unfair and sneaky way.  It reminds me of the Chinese Government staging traffic disruptions to prevent journalists accessing detention centres in Xinjiang.

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, to the House to debate the issues raised in that webinar as well as the fact that almost half of all carer's allowance applications are refused.  It is fair to say that during the pandemic carers have ensured that many people have been able to remain in their homes.  They are our unsung heroes and need a helping hand.  Too many of them receive little or no support from the State.  I have been taken aback by the number of people applying for carer's allowance who are continually being refused a payment.  It is a critical support for those caring for relatives, who are saving the State an estimated &euro;10 billion fortune.  Every week, I deal with families impacted by the failure of the Government to increase the means test for this essential support.<\/p> <p>Figures I have compiled show that nearly half of all applications in the past three years have not been successful.  This is a very worrying trend.  From 2018 to this year, there were 51,730 applications, but 23,982 of them were refused.  According to a departmental report, slightly more than 84,000 people received a carer's allowance payment in 2019.  I also looked at the social welfare appeals office.  It processed 3,539 carer's allowance cases in 2019, with just over a third or 35% of them allowed.<\/p> <p>Even those who manage to get some level of payment do not receive anywhere near enough support.  For many years, Family Carers Ireland and other support groups have been calling for a change to the conditions attached to the payment.  The income disregard has not budged since 2008.  For 12 years, the rate for a single person has remained at &euro;332.50 and that for a couple has remained at &euro;665.  There are 355,000 carers in Ireland.  One in every ten people is currently involved in caring.  According to Family Carers Ireland, that figure is set to rise to one in five by 2030.  Carers have also had to deal with the withdrawal of respite, home care, transport, personal assistant hours and residential care during the pandemic, leaving many of them to cope on their own.<\/p> <p>The fact that it is so difficult to get support in the form of the carer's allowance needs to be tackled in the forthcoming budget.  The programme for Government commits to a guarantee that would include a core basket of services, but unless the means test and income disregard are addressed, too many people will be locked out of these State supports.  Family Carers Ireland is calling for the forthcoming budget to include an increase in the means test from &euro;332.50 to &euro;450 for a single person and from &euro;665 to &euro;900 for a couple.  The Labour Party supports that proposal.  I call on the Government to address the means test for carer's allowance once and for all and to widen access to the payment.  The very simple ask from Family Carers Ireland is to increase the income disregard such that a person on the average income can qualify for it.

No doubt these companies have transformed our lives in many ways for the better and are significant employers, both here and internationally.

That should be looked at.  The points the Senator makes around compliance stand.<\/p> <p>As yesterday was European Carers' Day, this provides us with an opportunity.  This budget and these times present an opportunity for a new deal for carers, that is, an increased amount of carer's allowance, more sensible access to it, easier access - I agree with Senator Wall that we should make it easier - and more supports for carers.  In other words, we should exalt or give prominence or respect to the profession of carer in the home.  There are estimated to be up to 400,000 of these family carers.  They are a crucial resource.  It is not about cold economics.  It is about far more.  In cold economic terms, I would say to the Leader that we could save a great deal of money here by de-institutionalisation and the saving of other services and hospitalisation.  We cannot keep people at home and get that going without such a service and without support for family carers.  We also should accelerate this process.  I ask the Leader to give us a timeframe on when there will be a statutory package of care for people at home, in terms of care attendants and carers at home, that is like the fair deal.  That would make an amazing contribution to keeping people out of institutions.  In the Covid context, in the context of where people are happiest and in the context of cold economics which is not the real issue, there is a great case for keeping people out of institutions.  This is an exciting opportunity now.  There is a recognition by the IMF and others that we can go into budget deficit for this kind of thing now.  This is a big opportunity to give a very high status to our carers.  I would ask the Leader for a debate on it in light of yesterday being carers' day and of its great significance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#M00800","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Last week I spoke about the Public Service Management Act 1997 and, specifically, about the positions of advisers to Ministers.  Advisers are the only people who are not accountable in any way to the public.  I am asking the Leader to organise a debate in this House where we can explore how this might change and make the appointees more accountable, perhaps to Oireachtas committees.  I am not saying Ministers should not have policy advisers - I have no difficulty whatsoever with that - or expertise that they may need, but the public has a right to know who they are.  We spent &euro;4.9 million last year on advisers, at an average salary of &euro;86,500.  That is a great deal of money and a great many advisers.  We should have a debate on it.  It is time to kick it out in the open and look at it from a public information perspective.  Every Minister, Deputy, Senator and county councillor is accountable and it is important that we know who is advising Ministers and what angle they are coming from.  We only have to look across the water and see what an adviser can achieve that is dangerous.  From that perspective, I would like to have that debate.<\/p> <p>My colleague, Senator Mullen, spoke about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Policing in this country is by consent and to try and use the police to enforce something without giving them the powers is a nonsense.

I have no difficulty with public protests, etc., but what we saw on Grafton Street last week is an affront to the entire population of this country who are trying to escape the worst ravages of Covid-19.  We get these people sitting shoulder to shoulder on Grafton Street, not only putting their own lives at risk but putting the lives of every citizen who walks or works on that street.  They should be held accountable.  I am delighted to see the Garda is investigating the organisers.  The Bundestag announced today that there is a fine of &euro;5,000 for Members of the Bundestag who parade through the House without a mask.  I wonder if that would work in Leinster House.  At the end of the day, speaking to people of my own age and older, they are petrified by these demonstrations.  We should all uphold the right to demonstrate but it is unacceptable in this country at any time to put people's lives at risk by walking shoulder to shoulder and screaming at citizens to take off their masks.

We are being asked to do so in order to prevent us having to move to level 4 or to a full lockdown under level 5.  I pray to God that we can avoid that.  God knows it is our responsibility to do so.

I am glad the Government is putting that front and centre in the budget next week by underpinning existing plans and introducing new ones.  The refreshing of the national development plan, NDP, that is due to be announced in the spring next year will provide a platform for economic stimulus and societal gain in many parts of the country.  Navan is a major town that really needs such benefits.  It is the largest town in the greater Dublin area without rail connectivity to the city centre.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has been talking about initiating a review of rail services since autumn last year, the implementation of which would commence this autumn.  The authority has spent a full 12 months talking about a review and now we are told that it will be the summer of 2022 before it is completed.  Three years down the track - a phantom track that does not exist - we might have a completed review.<\/p><p>The crux of the matter is that the NTA's review will not be finished by the time the revised NDP is announced next spring, which means that the development of a rail service for Navan could be left off the table altogether.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, needs to address this issue now on the basis of the clear facts that are before him.  There is a fear that the reduction in traffic movements because of the pandemic will be used, in the context of the review, as a reason not to endorse a rail plan for Navan to the city centre.  Such a plan clearly stacks up and is supported by the facts, as the Leader knows from her time on Meath County Council and in Cabinet.  We need the Minister to commit to delivering for Navan in accordance with the position he has always taken on public transport.  Unlike his predecessor, former Deputy Shane Ross, this Minister knows where Navan is and where Trimgate Street is and he knows the benefit of good public transport.  I have written to him today asking him to act in this matter.  I ask the Leader to press the case because this is a crucial issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#M01000","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I support the Government's decision to move the whole country to level 3 rather than level 5.

Some of the categories into which expenses are organised need review.  I appreciate that the provisions were reviewed as recently as 2017 but, since then, some of the categories, such as insurance, have become considerably out of kilter and out of step with actual costs.  For instance, there is an allocation of &euro;25.82 per month for car insurance, which would amount to an annual insurance cost of &euro;309.  I would really like to meet the driver who is able to obtain a premium at that price and to avail of his or her competence to get a similar price for my own insurance.

The enormous pressure on services has stretched them to incredible lengths.  I spoke this morning with St. Michael's House in Dublin 9.

Basically, 3.5 clinicians, namely, a part-time psychologist, an OT, a speech therapist and a physiotherapist, have been taken from the pool of the network disability team in south Kildare to deal with the new assessments.  This is completely wrong.  Many children have been impacted and a particular special school has been impacted as well.  That is happening in mid and north Kildare and I have no doubt that it is happening all around the country as well.

It is clich&eacute; to say that we are all in this together, but we are whether we like it or not.  Trying to pit one social activity against another in terms of which should be allowed defeats the purpose.  As of last week, Fr. Gerry Stuart in my church has started putting masses online for people like my Dad who cannot go out and people like my Mam who had been going to mass but can no longer attend.  We can access things like that online.  Unfortunately, we cannot enjoy our county finals like we did last weekend when Ratoath won.  I had hoped that Ratoath would win again next weekend.<\/p> <p>We are all in this together.  We must recognise that we are making sacrifices, not just for ourselves, but for the good of those we care about - our families and our communities.  It is a pain in the rear end for us all.  It is even affecting people who are in the whole of their health.  I find myself being teary for no reason whatsoever.  There is nothing wrong with me - I have healthy kids and a healthy family.  However, we must recognise that there are people who are not healthy.  They are the ones for whom we are doing this.  It is to respect their good health.<\/p> <p>It is a tough situation and it is easy to be critical of this or that set of people, but the people who are making decisions on our behalf, be they doctors or politicians, are doing it to ensure that the best interests of people's lives and livelihoods are served.  In the next number of weeks or months, we cannot find ourselves in the position of being unable to sustain financially the supports that people have enjoyed for the past couple of months.  It is vital that we sustain those supports until whenever the end of the tunnel arrives and we get a vaccine or find some magical way of living with this virus in a sustainable way, although I doubt the latter will happen.  I ask that Senators be respectful of one another and kind towards the people who are doing their level best to serve us.<\/p> <p>I will do as much as I can to provide space in Government time or any other group's time for necessary debates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#P00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>An amendment to the Order of Business has been proposed by Senator Flynn: \"That a debate with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on accommodation for the Traveller community be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#P00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment and take the Leader at her word.

Last week, we were chatting about the elephant in the room and the need for the Minister of State to, perhaps, confront it.  I will reach out to him with an olive branch, as he knows that is the way we work in Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is very important that the Minister of State engages with us on the Bill.  If his determination is just to reject amendment after amendment, we will push every amendment.<\/p><p>The amendment from Senator Higgins we are discussing is very reasonable.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWithin 12 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report in respect of the impact and use of the provisions in this Act, including a consideration of compatibility with the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) guidelines, and their impact, if any, on the Revenue Commissioners. <\/blockquote> <p>This cuts to the core of our concerns as the truth is that because of the lack of pre-legislative scrutiny, we are not sure if there are pitfalls in this Bill.  I have concerns.<\/p><p>I should also flag to the Minister of State that I was contacted by a journalist who maintains a submission was made to the his Department on this Bill by the industry and, effectively, it was effectively written by people in the industry.  I am not making that claim but I am putting it to the Minister of State and I would like a response.  The disturbing fact is that a copy of the submission was sought but the request was refused.  I do not know the rights and wrongs of this but it is causing me particular concern.  The Minister of State's job today is not just to drive through the Bill but it should be to engage with us constructively, take on board the concerns of both me and others and work with us in that regard.<\/p><p>There was a lack of pre-legislative scrutiny with this Bill.  We know what has happened in the past week; I will not revisit it but the experience has been very uncomfortable for all us in the way the former Member left, almost in the middle of the night.  When my colleague, former Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, left, he gave notice, came here and made a farewell speech.  It is bizarre and worrying that somebody could leave on the type of terms we saw.  I am not the only person who feels that way.<\/p><p>There are real concerns about the Bill.  We do not know enough about it and we have not looked into it enough.  We know in other jurisdictions these kinds of investments can lead to very poor practice, to put it mildly.  I am not suggesting it is the case here but rather that there are concerns we must address before moving forward.  My other key request is that the Minister of State agrees to a pause after Committee Stage so we can engage with the Minister and his Department on a cross-party basis to have a closer look at this Bill.<\/p><p>Perhaps we can agree on those points.  I am not saying that we will let the Bill through freely if we do, because there are two or three key sections that really concern us, but we will work with the Minister of State in a constructive and positive way.  If the Minister of State is not willing to do that, we will have a bit of argy-bargy for the next hour or so.  It would not be the end of the world and we will get on with it, but I hope we can work constructively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#T00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his comments on the amendment.  I will deal with the amendment first before responding to the Senator's points.<\/p><p>I understand what is behind the amendment, which proposes the making of a report for laying before the Houses.  I reassure the House that it is my intention to lay a post-enactment scrutiny note 12 months after the enactment, in line with Standing Orders.  It is now normal procedure that within 12 months of legislation being passed, post-enactment scrutiny would be published.  I contend the good intention in the amendment has been taken care of by Standing Orders <i>in situ<\/i>.<\/p><p>I will outline our commitments on international tax and where Senators can find regular updates in that regard.  The OECD BEPS project developed 15 actions designed to equip governments, in domestic and international rules and instruments, to address tax avoidance, ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activity generating the profits is performed and where value is created.  That process is ongoing and most people would be surprised if the BEPS process was completed in a 12-month period.  Ireland has very strong views and we do not see some of the proposals as being in Ireland's interest.  It will be a long time before we get to the OECD BEPS guidelines being enacted.  It will not happen in the next 12 months but we will have that other report.<\/p><p>On the domestic level, the corporation tax roadmap, which was published in September 2018, outlined the actions Ireland would take and significant measures were delivered in the Finance Act 2019.  An update of Ireland's corporation tax roadmap will be published in the weeks ahead, reflecting on the significant progress we have made and considering the future actions that may be required to ensure Ireland's tax system meets the international standard.  The updated corporation tax roadmap will also provide an opportunity to reflect on the evolving international tax environment and the important work that continues at OECD level.  Accordingly, due to the upcoming publication of the update to the corporation tax roadmap and the commitment to a post-enactment scrutiny within 12 months, I will not be accepting the amendment.  Both matters have been reasonably dealt with.<\/p><p>As we all know, it was agreed by the Oireachtas that there was no requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny with this Bill.  The matter was dealt with earlier this year by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  It was sought but Oireachtas committees had not been put in place during the summer, so it was not possible to have such pre-legislative scrutiny.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->With regard to a related matter that has been raised, it is important that I put it on the public record that the original iteration of this Bill, which eventually went through the Lower House in 2019, was the investment limited partnership and Irish collective asset-management vehicle (amendment) Bill 2017.  An issue was raised about who would have participated in the pre-legislative scrutiny at that stage.  It is very important that I put this on the public record.  On 20 November 2017, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe - no one else - wrote to the Oireachtas joint committee of Deputies and Senators specifically on that legislation to say that officials from the Department would be available to meet the committee to clarify further the provisions of the Bill and to ask for the committee to come back on pre-legislative scrutiny.  Two months later - and I am aware it was over the Christmas period - on 7 February 2018 the Oireachtas joint committee wrote back to Department of Finance on a number of issues.  Under No. 3, pre-legislative scrutiny, four items were mentioned.  The committee, which was made up of Deputies and Senators, wrote to the Department regarding the first format of the Bill to say it would not undertake scrutiny of the investment limited partnership and Irish collective asset-management vehicle (amendment) Bill 2017.  It was a decision of the joint committee to not undertake pre-legislative scrutiny.  They were offered it and they were told the officials would be available.  The joint committee in the last Oireachtas chose not to do it.  There was no pre-legislative scrutiny.  Nobody involved in the Oireachtas up to now or at the moment was ever involved in any pre-legislative scrutiny on this issue because of a decision made by an Oireachtas joint committee, rather than by the Department, the Minister and the Government.  A committee of Deputies and Senators chose not to do it.  I genuinely hope this fully updates the record of the House on the question of pre-legislative scrutiny.  During the course of the summer of this year, when the committees had not yet been populated, the House decided not to have pre-legislative scrutiny on this occasion.  On the basis of the points I have already covered, I am not in a position to accept this particular amendment today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#T00500","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  It is very important that we clarify for the record that the decision to which he refers was made by the previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  As a member of the current Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach I would say that no decision has been made by the committee because no opportunity for a decision has been provided to it.  As the Minister of State has said, the current committee was not formed at the time this Bill was placed on the Order Paper.  The committee was formed in the week in which this Bill was brought to the Chamber.  Therefore, the Government would have had an opportunity, if it so wished, to seek to bring the Bill to the point of pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>I note that when legislation has been brought forward by the Opposition and wider concerns have been raised, it has been a common practice for a request to be put to the relevant committee for the issue to be scrutinised further before the Bill proceeds from Second Stage to Committee Stage.  When I look around the House, I recognise people who have experienced this when it has happened in the past.  Of course it is the prerogative of the committee, but there is nothing to preclude the Minister of State from requesting the committee to examine issues around the Bill in the interim between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  I suggest to the Minister of State that this would be advisable.  As has been said earlier, this is not simply about making sure we are technically within the boxes; it is also about proper process being seen to be done.  It is not just about whether we are confident it was done; it is also about it being seen to be done.  There is a huge issue of confidence in the public mind specifically around the area of financial services following some of the decisions made in the past regarding the bailout.  It is very important that there is public confidence in people seeing their concerns fully and properly addressed and, while everybody is entitled to lobby, that there is not a perception of lobbyists being in direct conversation with the Government, or of other conversations with public representatives being in any way short-circuited.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the Minister of State did not get the opportunity to address it in his first response but I respectfully suggest that because the circumstances have changed, there needs to be a period of reflection and engagement with the joint committee and others on a cross-party basis between Committee Stage and Report Stage of this Bill.  This point was made by my colleague, Senator Gavan.  It is a concern especially in the context of this Bill, which was championed by a particular lobbying body that now has working for it a former Minister of State who would previously have engaged with that body.  This concern needs to be seen to be addressed and reflected upon in an appropriate way.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State did not have the opportunity to clarify the extent to which there has been prior consideration of the issue of base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS.  My amendment calls for a report within 12 months of the passing of the Bill.  I note there are those who suggest I should be looking to a report and perhaps even a review and expiry of the measures at some stage.  Perhaps 12 months might be too soon to assess fully the impact these measures will have.  The Minister of State mentioned a roadmap on corporation tax that we are due to have.  Will the Minister of State commit, or assure us, that he will not proceed to Report Stage of this Bill before we have the roadmap on corporation tax ahead of us?  That would be a really appropriate gesture of compromise and reflection.<\/p> <p>I remind the House that &euro;240 billion is lost every year as a result of BEPS.  There are 15 key actions that Governments are required to take.  Country-by-country reporting, which is action No. 13 under the BEPS framework, is one of the key issues.  The Minister of State might indicate where Ireland is on action No. 13 - country-by-country reporting - because it is a crucial issue.<\/p> <p>There is also the question of the Revenue Commissioners.  My other amendments on the Revenue Commissioners later in this Bill have been ruled out of order because they would potentially represent a charge on companies.  This is strange because it is also a possible benefit for the State.  There is a very real concern around any measure that might be seen to hollow out revenue for the State at a very critical time.  I wonder how we will be able to measure or assess the impact of these measures in revenue terms.  Will the corporation tax roadmap assist us and, if so, can we delay Report Stage of the Bill until after that roadmap?<\/p> <p>I note there has been a massive increase in investment limited partnerships.  Section 110, a previous scheme, was used by a lot of investment companies.  There was a big shift in where investment limited partnerships were happening in the UK and in other places when measures narrowed that scheme.  It seems to be channelled, or somehow linked, into the pressures around this Bill and I am also concerned about this.  Will this legislation be like section 110 insofar as we flag a potential concern and then flag it happening, and then years after the horse has bolted we discover there was a problem?  The capital gains tax waiver, for example, was signalled by many of us as a real concern early down the line with regard to its exploitation by investment funds.  That was recognised by the Government but possibly two years too late.  We are just trying to get ahead of things again.<\/p> <p>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would clarify those few questions.  What are his intentions around reflection or engagement between Committee Stage and Report Stage?  What consideration, if any, of the OECD actions was taken in relation to the Bill and the drafting of the Bill?  Will the Minister of State clarify the corporation tax roadmap and how he sees this Bill reflecting or relating to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#U00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I call Senator Gavan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#U00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>It is important to let the Minister of State back in directly to respond to the forensic comments made by Senator Higgins.

It has been around for quite a period of time.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the interests of supporting the industry, having new business opportunities in the financial services sector in Ireland, additional investment into Ireland and job creation potential in Ireland, it was decided to proceed with this legislation.  Ireland does not want other countries, which are moving a bit more swiftly with their legislation, having products available that people are seeking to invest in but Ireland not having the adequate legislation in place.  That is why we drafted this legislation over a five-year period.<\/p><p>To start with, the financial services industry was asked and every investment limited partnership, ILP, will be regulated by the Central Bank.  If we have confidence in the Central Bank, we have to be happy that it will do that job, and that is why it was involved in the legislation in that it will be the regulator.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners were extensively involved in this, ensuring that the issues to which the Senator referred were adequately dealt with, which is why we have greater transparency in relation to same.  People have to show their passports or prove they are the beneficial owner, which is an improvement on the original legislation.  That was not in the original iteration.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied with the current regime in relation to the taxation of the profits of ILPs.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation was heavily involved because it is part of business promotion.  This would have been cleared at EU and IMF levels because such legislation now requires clearance at EU and IMF levels.  Therefore, there has been quite an extensive amount of discussion on this legislation over the five-year period.<\/p><p>On the base erosion and profit shifting guidelines, one of the most critical ones that we have already implemented is action 13, that is, out of a total of 15.  It concerns country-by-country reporting.  That is really what people want to see where businesses are operating at an EU level above a certain threshold of turnover, that is, that there is country-by-country reporting.  We will continue to implement some of the other base erosion and profit sharing actions in good faith, notwithstanding that the process is not yet complete, and nobody can give a date on which that will happen.  People will have to accept that it is not appropriate to put this legislation on hold pending negotiations at OECD level, when nobody can put a date on when it might be.<\/p><p>The corporation tax legislation currently in place is very strong and robust and fully caters for this.  We discussed this on Second Stage in the Seanad where this legislation was initiated.  I provided answers on taxation in terms of ensuring there was full taxation of profits that arise as a result of this legislation.<\/p><p>The roadmap for corporation tax, which was published two years ago, is due to be updated in the near future.  It is not specific to this legislation at all; it is much broader than this.  Whatever that roadmap might say on ILPs or might not say, because there might not be anything to report, I do not think it would be appropriate to hold up the establishment of these new business opportunities for Ireland to increase employment and revenue into the State, and investment through these funds, pending matters outside our control.<\/p><p>I always understood there was a First Stage, a Second Stage, a Committee Stage, a Report Stage and a Final Stage to legislation.  I am not aware of any in-between Stage, for example, a Committee plus Stage, where something can be taken after Committee Stage for pre-legislative scrutiny, which is essentially being requested here.  I have provided the reason that it did not happen initially and did not happen on this occasion either.  The committees were not in place and quite recently the Business Committee specifically waived the right to pre-legislative scrutiny before this legislation came before either of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That was done on 3 September 2020 by the Business Committee.<\/p><p>The issue of pre-legislative scrutiny has been discussed at length.  Everybody agreed that it was not necessary on this occasion.  We are going through the normal legislative process, following the roadmap that we go through in the Oireachtas, and that roadmap can be very extensive and detailed.  I am not aware of how I or the House has any authority to change the roadmap, and introduce a Committee plus Stage before Report Stage.  I am not in a position, nor do I think anyone is, to give that commitment.  The legislative process requires a Committee Stage followed by a Report Stage.  I am not in a position to give a commitment that I can alter the process by which legislation is put through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#U00500","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Was there cross-party engagement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#V00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The first level of cross-party engagement was at the joint committee when it chose----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#V00300","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>The previous committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#V00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The previous committee chose not to do so.

I must say it has been disappointing so far.  This is still awkward, and it is becoming more awkward, because what we were due to discuss today was the Credit Union Restructuring Bill 2020, but that was dropped, and this Bill was put on the agenda.  It gives more credence to the question I raised on the first day, last week and I raise again now.  What is the mad rush in relation to this Bill, particularly given what has happened in the past fortnight?  The Minister of State has not addressed that matter.  He has not addressed the matter of fact that the Minister who designed this Bill is now head of the Irish Association of Investment Management.  He must address this matter.<\/p> <p>Unless I am mistaken, the Minister of State has answered the question on the pause and said he will drive on with this.  While I do not like his answer, I thank him for it.  I ask him to answer the question I asked earlier in relation to submissions received from the investment industry and publication of same.  I have been told the Minister of State's Department received a significant submission, and that effectively the industry has written this Bill.  I have also been told that when a journalist asked for a copy of this submission, it was refused.  I think it is important that we get clarity on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#V00700","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I am happy to hear that answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#V00800","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I am personally not aware of that, and the only commitment I can give today is that I will have a response to that before Report Stage.  I do not have the information today.  I was not aware the Senator was going to raise that issue.  If I had been aware of that in advance, perhaps I could have prepared a response.  However, I do not have the information to reply to the question with me.  The only commitment I can give is that I will have a response to the point the Senator made prior to Report Stage.<\/p> <p>The Senator raised the issue of the Credit Union Restructuring Bill and asked why it has been held over.  I will be up front.  The reason is this Bill is more critical for the economy, for job creation and for investment than the Credit Union Restructuring Bill.  The Credit Union Restructuring Bill will be before the House shortly.  A restructuring board was established for credit unions after the financial crisis.  Its job is completed.  The Bill concerns the winding up of an old board that no longer has any function.  It is a bit of housekeeping to wind up the old restructuring board that no longer has a role to play.  There are no jobs or investment hinging on that Bill.  Therefore, I would prioritise this legislation over the winding of the restructuring board legislation because this has job creation potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#V00900","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>It might be useful if the Minister of State could provide us with information on the job creation potential before the next Stage because a lot of this seems to be around a different product that investors can buy.  I think he hit on the nub of it when he mentioned other products that are available elsewhere.  It is not around new industries being created, it is effectively around new products being offered.  That is a concern.  There are also other elements of concern in the Bill which we will have an opportunity to discuss later.  One of my key concerns with the Bill relates to whether it might facilitate greater movement of investors between Luxembourg, the Channel Islands, Ireland and elsewhere in terms of where they get the better deal at the time.  Anything that pushes us into a competitive dynamic where we are racing against each other in terms of investments is not necessarily a healthy way of engaging with or regulating the investment sector.  I have a wider concern than the Minister of State's response touched upon.<\/p> <p>I appreciate some of the points made by the Minister of State regarding the OECD.  It is our prerogative to discuss our compatibility with it, even if we have not implemented the measures.  I do not think my amendment is contradicted by the points the Minister makes.  I hope and trust the Minister will champion the fast-tracking of full compatibility with the OECD, as I think that is important.<\/p> <p>Others have made points to me about the timing of my report, suggesting that perhaps it needs to be slightly longer so that we can see what impact there might be, given that the first few months may be taken up with the companies setting up these structures and may not have time for a report.<\/p> <p>I will speak to section 4 in a wider sense.  I note that there are other aspects of section 4, including the question of the definition of \"beneficial owner\".  The level is set at a 25% share, which is quite a high threshold in terms of beneficial owner.  I am also concerned about the definition of \"limited partner\".  They may be issues we will come back to as well on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>My amendment may not be perfect and I recognise that we will have a form of report within 12 months, but because this is the only amendment in which I am able to put down a marker in terms of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting and the issues concerning revenue, I will still press the amendment.  I appreciate and thank the Minister of State for providing the information he has given on his engagement with the Revenue Commissioners, and the lengthy answer in that regard.  That is an issue I might try to follow up further with the Minister of State because I am conscious that amendments concerning the issue are often not compatible in terms of the potential charge on the Exchequer but there are a couple of issues I would like to tease out.  I will press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#W00100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I ask Senators to speak to the amendment.

Only a few weeks ago, on 1 September, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, wrote to the Ceann Comhairle seeking pre-legislative scrutiny.  There was an intention to start it in the D&aacute;il but it so happened to start in the Seanad.  The Minister wrote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe proposed legislative changes to the Investment Limited Partnership structure will provide a more flexible regime for investors wishing to use a partnership structure for regulated investment funds, to make Ireland more attractive to international investors and to grow the private equity funds sector.  The Bill provides for Investment Limited Partnerships to migrate in and out of Ireland, subject to authorisation by the Central Bank of Ireland.  In addition, there are some amendments to the ICAV Act 2015.  <br \/><br \/>Information on the various changes are enclosed in the draft legislation prepared by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.   <\/blockquote> <p>The people who drafted the legislation are in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.

I will probably table amendments to the section on Report Stage.  My particular concern relates to the extension of section 6(4) of the Act of 1994, which will allow for the participation of limited partners on advisory committees.  They will also be allowed to serve on boards and committees of investment limited partnerships and to appoint, elect or otherwise participate in the choice of representatives or any another persons to be on such a board or committee.  They will also be allowed to act as a member of a board on a board or committee.<\/p> <p>My concern about this section is that, in other parts of the Bill, limited partners are excluded from a lot of liability.  This Bill effectively ensures that, in many cases, limited partners will be excluded from a wide range of both criminal and financial liabilities.  We will discuss those liabilities later.  The real concern is that this section would allow limited partners to serve on boards and committees that are making decisions, even though they will have less liability than other board members.  This raises a question of responsibility.  We are giving people power to take part in the business of these investment partnerships and to potentially influence and guide what general partners might do, but they will not share in the liability.  It is an extension of the safe harbour provisions provided in other legislation for other reasons.  The rationale for this needs to be looked at.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify that rationale.  <\/p> <p>There is a real risk that we will end up with a nominal general partner who will hold and carry the liability while limited partners, who are excluded from liability, call the shots and steer and guide what happens in an investment limited partnership through their role as members of the board or their role in selecting those members.  The Minister of State can see my concern.  These people will have powers but not responsibilities.  That is my concern and, for that reason, I will oppose section 7 of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#BB00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Senator's contribution on the section.  On the face of it, I understand why she would say everything she has just said, but there is more to it than that.  As Senator Higgins has said, section 7 amends the 1994 Act to permit a limited partner to participate on boards and committees related to an investment limited partnership.  This adds board participation to what might be called a \"white list\" of activities which, if undertaken by a limited partner, will be deemed not to be taking part in the conduct of the business and which will therefore not result in loss of liability for a limited partner.  This list of activities includes serving on boards or committee of the investment limited partnership, choosing a person to serve on such a board, and making a decision to approve a change to the partnership agreement.  It should be borne in mind that, to start with, the partnership agreement involves everybody coming together to agree a partnership.  Any partner, limited or general, can make a request or recommendation at any stage to make changes to that partnership agreement.  Others may not choose to approve such a change.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Depending on the voting strength of those opposed, that might be the end of the matter.

I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the winter plan, which was published by the Health Service Executive on 24 September.  Every winter, our healthcare system faces increasing pressures on it, making it more difficult for people, particularly older people, to access treatment as quickly as we would wish.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is particularly noticeable in emergency departments, which see overcrowding, longer waiting times and patients receiving care on trolleys.  This year the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to underscore and increase these existing pressures.<\/p><p>The &euro;600 million investment in the winter plan represents a statement of the Government's intention to work towards moving care and the required resources towards home and community care, in line with the principles set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.  As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I particularly welcome the plan's focus on supports for older people and those groups at greater risk.  This is fundamental.  Older people are more likely to be admitted to an acute hospital following a visit to an emergency department and they are more likely to experience a wait on a hospital trolley.  Of course, other areas of our health system also need attention.  I will advocate for increased funding for mental health services in our budget discussions.<\/p><p>I welcome the addition of further community healthcare networks, 36 community specialist teams and 11 acute hospital front-of-house teams.  These will create the foundation and organisational structure which will allow older people to be treated in their own local community while still receiving the required standard of care.  These networks and specialist teams will work closely with the National Ambulance Service to deliver end-to-end care with the aim of keeping people out of hospital, or where they are admitted, ensuring they are discharged without delay.  The plan expects that this could lead to one in five of our older family members, neighbours and friends over the age of 75 not needing to be admitted to hospital at all. <\/p><p>I welcome the additional community beds, which will allow patients to leave hospital earlier and provide care closer to people's homes, as well as the 4.76 million additional home support hours, which will allow people to remain in their own homes.  I also welcome the commitment to the provision of aids and appliances to an additional 5,500 people.  Simple interventions like this can make a vast improvement to an older person's quality of life and independence. <\/p><p>I want to mention mental health, which is a very important part of my remit as Minister of State.  As many Members of this House have noted throughout the pandemic, the outbreak of Covid-19 is giving rise to significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people.  This arises from fear of the disease itself, as well as from increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.<\/p><p>During this period, acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although numbers have been reduced in some settings and telehealth services also have been used to protect both staff and patients.  Further improvements to mental health services are included in the overall HSE pandemic plan, Delivering Health Services in a Covid-19 Pandemic, to address HSE service delivery to the end of 2021 in the context of the pandemic.  I would like to add my congratulations to various State bodies, including the HSE and the Department of Health.  Some 90% of mental health supports have been maintained during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Services have obviously had to move to a more blended approach, with many supports delivered online.  For anyone already receiving services, 90% of supports were retained.  That did not happen in all sectors, but I am delighted that the most vulnerable were able to receive those supports.<\/p><p>I wish to assure Members that I am working to secure additional direct funding for mental health services in the context of the main pandemic plan, a matter which is being considered as part of the Estimates.  As part of this strategic plan, the additional resources I am seeking through the Estimates process are intended for the fulfilment of several short-term recommendations of the new national mental health policy, Sharing The Vision.<\/p><p>Full implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme continues to be our goal, but the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has presented us with the more immediate task of resuming our services to the level they were at before the outbreak of the pandemic, in a prioritised manner.  At the Government's request, the HSE developed a strategy for health service delivery to the end of 2021 in the context of the pandemic.  The winter plan, which is a part of that strategy, focuses on the immediate problems we will be facing this winter.  As I said at its launch, I welcome the publication of the plan by the HSE.  I particularly welcome the HSE's recognition of the importance of reducing the number of patients receiving care on trolleys in emergency departments and improving patient experience and waiting times in the context of Covid-19.  It is also important to point out that although this year has brought unprecedented challenges, the &euro;600 million pledged under the winter plan is also unprecedented, amounting to 20 times the figure pledged in any previous year's plan.<\/p><p>Last winter more than 620,000 people visited emergency departments.  While I encourage everyone who needs emergency medical treatment to seek it, experts generally agree that many patients could be cared for outside of the hospital.  Where appropriate, the plan therefore provides alternative pathways to care with the aim of easing the pressures on the hospital system, including the emergency departments, and ensuring more timely egress from hospitals.  This will free up hospital resources for the job they should be doing.<\/p><p>The plan is designed to enable patients to be seen in the community wherever possible by providing a better service in community healthcare settings.  It is intended to allow patients to receive timely care in hospital when this is necessary, and return home or to appropriate care settings when well enough to leave hospital through the provision of more home care and step-down options.<\/p><p>The plan provides for building capacity and resilience in the system.  One of our core tasks is building extra capacity in the acute hospital system.  In 2018 the health service capacity review was published.  This outlined the requirement for increased acute and non-acute bed capacity in the system alongside major reform in the way healthcare is delivered.  The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our healthcare services in line with the recommendations of the review and the commitments in project Ireland 2040.  This winter plan provides additional health service capacity across a range of services and settings, including in our acute hospitals, to help reduce admissions and allow earlier discharges.  Key initiatives include an the addition of 483 acute hospital beds, 89 sub-acute beds, 631 rehabilitation places and 530 repurposed community beds to support the pathway to home care.  These community beds are absolutely essential.  In a pilot scheme in Waterford last year, 20 beds in a nursing home facility were bought at a cost of &euro;1,000 each.  Persons deemed by their consultants to be fit enough to be discharged but not well enough to go home were transferred to community beds for three or four weeks.  This provided a respite for patients waiting to receive home care or to go into a nursing home.  This is a great model and should be rolled out everywhere.  I really welcome the 530 repurposed community beds, which will support the pathway to home care. <\/p><p>The plan also provides for the utilisation of private hospitals for urgent complex care in order to reduce waiting lists.  This capacity can also be used in the case of a surge in Covid-19 cases.  The plan commits to delivering more diagnostics in the community, allowing patients to be seen closer to home and avoid going to hospital.  It puts supports in place for GPs, particularly those in rural practices, to support service continuity.  The plan also aims to deliver twice the current level of home support hours to support the home first initiative, designed to allow even those with high and moderate levels of frailty to be cared for in their own homes.  To facilitate this, 4.76 million additional home support hours are being provided for in the plan, at a cost of &euro;139 million.<\/p><p>A comprehensive flu vaccination programme is essential this winter.  The HSE ordered approximately 1.35 million doses of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine as well as 600,000 doses of the live attenuated influenza vaccine, which will be made available to children between the ages of two and 12.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to address the question of waiting lists, for which funding is provided.  I recognise the necessity of the decision taken by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to defer elective care procedures earlier this year.  I know this has had an impact on scheduled care waiting lists and on the lives of the people waiting for these operations.  Hospital waiting list figures are higher than at the start of the year, with the inpatient day case and outpatient waiting lists 17% and 10% higher, respectively, than at the start of January.  However, there are some indications of improvements.  Due to the joint efforts of the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, the growth in waiting lists has slowed since services resumed in June.  Since May there has been a reduction of almost 11% in the numbers waiting for inpatient day case procedures, with early evidence that the rate of growth of the outpatient waiting list has slowed.<\/p><p>The HSE has actively sought innovative new ways to increase productivity through the increasing use of alternative work practices such as telemedicine, virtual clinics and alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and atypical outpatient settings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The HSE is also currently working to secure access to private hospital facilities for urgent and time-critical procedures.<\/p><p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, including increased use of private hospitals; funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals; funding \"see and treat\" services, where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations; funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients; virtual clinics; and clinical validation.  While acknowledging that waiting lists are at record levels, the combined impact of this work should help mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on waiting lists and the HSE and the NTPF will continue to work together to address this issue.<\/p><p>I welcome the Seanad's consideration of the winter plan today.  The Government is fully committed to its implementation and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and I want to work collaboratively with all stakeholders and across the Houses to do so.  Right now, we need to get the services back up and running to at least the level they were at prior to the outbreak of this pandemic.  This winter plan is part of that process and is designed to meet the immediate challenges we anticipate this winter.  The ambition of the plan, and the significant funding provided by the Government, gives me confidence that we can start to address the problems in the system.  I hope that is something all Senators in this House want and that they will support the plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#DD00300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I remind Senators that on the Order of Business today, it was agreed that each Senator would have five minutes of speaking time.

I am proud that our Government has circled in red additional supports for those in the increased risk category, the elderly, homeless people and those with chronic illnesses, and provided them with home supports.  Well done.  I am very proud of that.<\/p> <p>Much was done by the Government to support older adults with intellectual disabilities and mental health challenges in public and private long-term residential care facilities from the beginning of the crisis.  Area crisis management teams were established, which were a vital component in the management of outbreaks within long-term care facilities through upskilling staff in infection control procedures and implementation, providing PPE and public health advice, the provision of staff and support for own governance.  I note that this provision is being extended within this plan.  Again, well done.<\/p> <p>There always has to be a \"but\" and I have a little one, although it is a significant issue for those affected by it.  I want to draw the Minister of State's attention to the disability non-residential care sector, which has been mentioned frequently in these Houses over the past 24 hours.  I advocate for urgent additional supports for organisations in the voluntary and not-for-profit category, which support more than 26,000 people with intellectual disabilities and their families.  While day care services have resumed, they are still at a reduced level.  We need to urgently address the clients' and their families' needs for additional supports, as the current situation erodes all of their resilience.  Families have been stoically and intensively supporting their family members for months while experiencing their own levels of frustration.  Some felt they had been forgotten or left behind when additional supports were announced.<\/p> <p>In my constituency of Dublin South-Central, there is a super organisation called WALK, which is headed up by its director of services, Catherine Kelly.  It believes that people with disabilities have the right to live and contribute to the everyday life of their community.  It supports the development and maintenance of relationships which lead to the attainment and sustainability of socially valuable roles and natural support networks, providing employment, training and community living opportunities and supports.  However, it cannot do that work part time.  In response to the lockdown in April, it began to develop online sessions for its day service attendees and while it has reopened in a limited capacity, observing social distancing and providing services to people with disabilities and their families, those individuals and their families need this service to run five days a week as that is the most appropriate way of tailoring to their needs.  Nadine Vaughan, a mother whose adult son Sam is a service user with WALK, has commented to me that, while everyone is suffering with the effects of the pandemic and their lives have been curtailed, for people with special needs and their families, their only outlet is the day services.  Their lives have not just been curtailed but they cut off at the waist.  I ask the Minister of State to give urgent attention to disability day services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#FF00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>My apologies, I think I should have called Senator Clifford-Lee first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#FF00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with my colleague, Senator Fiona O'Loughlin.

I am happy to see that acute beds have been more than doubled and that there is a significant increase in sub-acute beds as well.<\/p> <p>Home support packages are the most important thing that stands out from this winter package.  We all know people who have suffered greatly and lost home supports over the years.  It is great to see them being introduced again and the supports being increased.  That was a key component of the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto and I am delighted to see that home packages are once again being prioritised.<\/p> <p>I am also happy to see the support for GPs, who are the unsung heroes in this pandemic.  They adapted their GP surgeries very quickly to deal with the new reality.  We have all done phone and video consultations with them at this stage and they have been absolutely fantastic in dealing with an ever-increasing workload, given that they were already overstretched as it was.  I pay particular tribute to the GPs of Ireland.<\/p> <p>I am also glad to see the emphasis on vaccinations in this package.  It is essential that everybody gets their vaccination, particularly those in a vulnerable group.  I thank the Minister of State for making such funds available.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is responsible for mental health and older people, I take this opportunity to address one specific matter with her, on which I hope we will be able to make some progress.  I refer to the mental health and well-being of the women of Ireland who have given birth or been pregnant during the pandemic.  They have gone to appointments and scans alone and often received some very bad news.  They have miscarried on their own, been told there is no heartbeat alone and given birth alone.  These matters are going to impact on the mental health and well-being of those women for evermore.  If we are going to live alongside the virus for the next number of years, the Minister for Health needs to address this issue.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on that.  I pay tribute to everybody working in the HSE and wish them the very best of luck for the winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#FF00500","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>We will have to make the Minister of State an honorary member of the Seanad at this point.

I acknowledge the Government's determination to meet the challenges head-on, the huge investment of an additional &euro;600 million and the very concrete actions outlined in the winter plan.  I recognise that all our healthcare workers have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic and they deserve every support we can give them as they face into their busiest and most difficult time of the year.  I also recognise the huge mental health effects Covid-19 has had on so many people of all ages in all sectors of Irish society.  We have to be mindful of how a winter of restrictions and anxiety will affect people who struggle with mental health.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State spoke about GPs.

We also have doubled the number of home support hours, which is positive.<\/p><p>I raise the matter of breast and cervical cancer screening under the winter plan.  We are all aware of the hidden health cost of Covid-19 and the unfortunate delays in care for cancer patients.  There are backlogs and lengthening delays in hospital waiting lists for appointments.

At the outset, I should say that the winter plan is being presented to the House on a day when the Government is also asking An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to create havoc on the roads for many people, which is a very bad idea.  It verges on the unlawful and all we must do is think for a moment what it would be like to be in a 4 km tailback with an older relative being brought to hospital, a nurse on the way to hospital or somebody opening a shop or other place of employment.  How would it feel to be stuck in a queue of that kind, deliberately created with a view to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na giving the public a short, sharp shock?  It is deplorable and the Garda Commissioner should reconsider the tactic immediately.  It is demeaning to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it will set ordinary people against garda&iacute; if they are inconvenienced in this cruel way.<\/p> <p>I note and welcome the increase in the number of acute beds as indicated by the Minister of State.  NPHET zoned in on the unavailability of ICU beds in particular and on the pressure that would be on them in the system.  There is nothing in the Minister of State's comments about extra ICU beds.  I understand, from indications not contained in her statement, that the plan is to increase the number by 17 in the winter programme.  The number is currently 282, meaning the total will be approximately 300.  I noticed that the Minister announced his intention to bring the number north of 300 in the future.  We are talking about 17 additional beds.<\/p> <p>Over the past five years, successive Governments have been warned about the major shortage of ICU beds.  We have had severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, and other episodes and this is not the first major problem for public health.  Nothing of significance has been done.  Going back to the emergence of this crisis in March, people were told that the shortage of ICU beds, which was particularly acute, was the reason we had to close the country.  It was to avoid that pressure on hospitals.  It is not sufficient for the Minister of State to come here and not even mention ICU beds.  I do not necessarily blame the Minister of State for the script supplied to her but there was no mention that this very serious constraint on our health system has been ignored and that reports advising successive Governments to do something about it have been shelved.  It is not good enough to say a number is north of 300 when it will be 299 or 300.  It is not good enough to speak about 17 beds as being sufficient in the current circumstances.<\/p> <p>I do not want to be critical of any individuals but I took an opportunity today, because a long-standing friend of mine asked me to do so, to look at the structure of NPHET.  The relevant information is available on the Government website.  The simple fact is that NPHET is not a new body that exists separately from anything else.  It is a single body, the membership of which comprises approximately 30 people.  The great majority of those individuals are either HSE employees, Department of Health employees or members of other statutory bodies.  There is a point that must be taken on board.  NPHET, the HSE and the Department of Health are all part of the State's apparatus to manage the health crisis we are experiencing.  I do not remember NPHET mentioning ICU beds at any stage except to indicate that capacity was a restraint earlier this year.  I do not remember anybody in the HSE or the Department of Health, between March and August, saying that in a national emergency we must increase the numbers of intensive care unit beds as quickly as possible.  I do not remember that happening.  One of the problems that emerged with the weekend's conflict has been that people on NPHET have been party to the failures that have created this shortage of acute hospital beds.  In effect, they are defending the indefensible with silence.<\/p> <p>I do not want to trespass on the time allotted to others.  There are aspects of the statement from the Minister of State which I regard as unsatisfactory.  It is welcome that she gave statistics on the number of flu vaccines that have been ordered but we have encountered major delays in administering those vaccines.  The statement did not cover such matters.  Some Senators may welcome this statement and the programme, and I agree that any resources will be welcomed where they are needed, but we have much more to do and we must demand more frankness from our Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#GG00200","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  She is here to present the plan but it is a little late in the year to be doing so.  She is aware that Sinn F&eacute;in made proposals in August and there are many people wondering why months were allowed to elapse over the summer when this work could have been done.  The plan has some good points but it appears that these are mostly aspirational rather than being part of an effective strategy.  It lacks detail and, in some ways, it is a little underwhelming.<\/p> <p>The plan is full of temporary measures.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree that our health service has been in crisis for many years and that this plan needs to be about more permanent solutions, capacity and expansion.  I am sure she agrees that we need beds but the announcements in this plan simply replace the capacity that existed before the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am sure everyone agrees that we are heading towards a potentially catastrophic winter for our health service and that we desperately need greater bed capacity, particularly critical care and ICU beds.<\/p> <p>It is somewhat a scandal that we are in the middle of this global pandemic with a health service that in any given year during winter is already bursting at its seams and yet we still only have half the number of critical care beds as compared to the European average.  In 2009, there were 289 critical care beds and we were told then that we needed 579.  Move forward 11 years and, in the middle of a global pandemic - the biggest health crisis this generation has faced - we have nine fewer critical care beds.<\/p> <p>We also desperately need staff, including doctors, nurses, consultants, medical scientists and other health and social care professionals.  Those people need investment.  The plan does not go far enough in respect of any of that.<\/p> <p>I welcome the ambitious targets for community beds but, again, there is a lack of detail.

We do so not to make a political point but because it makes perfect sense when trying to deal with a virus such as this.  It was very encouraging in the early days of the pandemic when we saw the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the two states.  Unfortunately, however, there have been significant gaps in implementing it.  There is, without a doubt, far more work that could be done.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a very serious and concerning situation which I have raised previously in the Chamber and with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and which my party has raised with the Northern Ireland Minister of Health, Mr. Robin Swann, and that is the serious concerns around the lack of cross-Border contact tracing.  My party also raised this issue last week at the North-South Ministerial Council.  However, I have been less than impressed with the length of time it has taken for this issue to be considered, let alone addressed, because, as far as I am aware, it still has not been fixed.  Time is of the essence.  It is no coincidence that the number of cases in Border constituencies are the highest on the island.  People need to wake up and smell the coffee.  We need to get this issue addressed now.  What have the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Northern Ireland health Minister, Mr. Swann, agreed in terms of a way to get the issue of contact tracing in Border constituencies addressed once and for all?<\/p><p>In the middle of the pandemic, with the worst winter that we will face in a long time to come, I am underwhelmed by the plan presented to the House.  It is obvious that NPHET has concerns around bed capacity, and ICU capacity in particular.  That is clear from the recommendations it made this week.  However, much as the Minister of State's colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, tried his best to portray otherwise, NPHET is not to blame for a broken health system that will struggle to cope if hospitalisations go up.  That is on the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, as well as the Government and previous Governments.  If this plan is anything to go by, there is no political will to be part of the solution in the health crisis we all face.  We had a broken health service before the virus.  The problems did not stem from the virus but, rather, from decades of bad government, bad decisions and poorly equipped winter plans such as this one.  I wish I could be more positive about the plan that has been announced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#GG00300","speaker":"1668","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Winter is always an extraordinarily difficult time in our health service, whether one is a healthcare worker, a patient or one who is anxious about a loved one in hospital.  My party colleague, Deputy Kelly, raised the issue of the flu vaccine in the D&aacute;il.   We are seeking an update on that issue because there is serious concern among general practitioners and many other sectors of society.  Pharmacies are advertising the flu vaccine online but when one fills out the form, one realises that one cannot get the vaccine.  We have been told that pharmacies should be receiving the vaccines in advance of the winter season.  What is the position regarding the volume of vaccine we will be getting?  It was flagged quite early that there were concerns around the volume of vaccine and that we needed to ensure we had a supply coming in.  Where are we at with regard to the supply of the vaccine and how will it be distributed to healthcare professionals?  Over what timespan will we have the vaccine this year?  We are obviously up against a deadline given the crisis in terms of non-Covid and Covid healthcare.<\/p> <p>The Labour Party has been raising the issue of Covid healthcare taking priority over non-Covid healthcare for many months.  I have deep concerns on this issue, especially after speaking to people working at various levels of the HSE in the past two weeks.  All Members have heard of the issues with the volume of people who may not be diagnosed this year.  The situation is worrying because the longer a person's illness remains undiagnosed, the less chance that person has of survival, particularly in the case of those with seriously acute conditions.<\/p> <p>The winter plan makes certain commitments on beds.  The Government has been trumpeting that there will be 1,500 new beds, but 409 of the 830 new acute beds , 45 of the 62 new critical care beds and 395 of the 484 new sub-acute beds are already in place.  In reality, there will be 89 new sub-acute beds in the run-in to a winter when we will grapple with the Covid-19 crisis in addition to the usual acute care demands.  That is a little less than reassuring.<\/p> <p>Of course, the number of beds is not the sum total of this equation.  The other key component is staff.  It is all well and good to promise extra beds and, goodness knows, we need them, but it is an entirely pointless exercise unless safe staffing is in place.  There are ambitious plans for recruitment and health, with more than 12,500 staff to be recruited, including 5,000 before Christmas and 7,500 afterwards.  From where are those staff going to come?  Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghda of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Association has pointed out that some nurses who came home from abroad have been unable to get full-time jobs.  What is going to radically change?  How will this work?  Where will we get the consultants we require?  From where will all these staff come?  How will the Government deliver on this commitment?  Where will the staff be placed?  <\/p> <p>I wish to briefly mention the issue of student healthcare professionals, many of whom are working without pay.  I know of at least one student nurse who is working on a Covid ward as part of her placement but is not getting paid and is unable to take up paid work in another setting due to concerns about cross-contamination.  That situation is extremely disheartening for student nurses, who are front-line healthcare workers.  Those students and unpaid workers cannot eat the candles placed in windows or survive on the public clapping for them.  This issue is of deep concern for those student nurses.<\/p> <p>We need an update on cancer screening.  The drop in the number of cancer screening tests since March will have a profound effect.  This week, I was briefed by the Irish Cancer Society on the drop-off in services for breast cancer patients.  As Members are aware, October is breast cancer awareness month.  With regard to Breastcheck, we know its services are not resuming in the way it was indicated they would.  The Irish Cancer Society is concerned that there are 600 people with undiagnosed cancer.  They do not know they have cancer and are unable to start treatment because of the drop-off and delay in services.  <\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to explain the slightly baffling decision to move from an interval of two years to an interval of three years in the context of mammograms.  If an interval of two years was previously the standard, I would like to know the new medical evidence indicating that an interval of three years should be the new standard.  I do not think Covid-19 is an acceptable reason for that decision.  I wish to know why the interval between screenings has changed.  Nobody has explained the reason for that decision or why we were using an interval of two years in the first place if there was a different standard.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the position in that regard.<\/p> <p>On CervicalCheck, some 6,000 letters have gone out but there has not been sufficient uptake, which is a real concern.  The low level of uptake needs to be tackled because otherwise there will be severe consequences down the line.  We know there are an extra 50,000 people on waiting lists because of Covid.  Never before in the history of the State have there been so many people on hospital waiting lists.  Frankly, unless the Government takes action, this issue will spiral further out of control.  It is clear from these figures that the reopening plan for non-Covid healthcare is inadequate and needs to be significantly beefed up.  What will be done to tackle the waiting lists and ensure no further delays are faced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#HH00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In her previous term in the Oireachtas, she showed real and genuine commitment to health, and mental health in particular.  I was delighted to see her take up her current role.<\/p> <p>When we started discussing these issues in March, April and May, much of the focus was on flattening the curve.  I remember thinking about how I could be of assistance.  I decided that as lots of people were focusing on flattening the curve, I would focus on the issue of what we do with the time we are buying.  Let us be clear that flattening the curve is only the buying of time in order to increase and support capacity.  I am concerned that the time gained by flattening the curve has not been well used.<\/p> <p>It seems to me that the lowering of the level was seen as a lessening of pressure.  We know that some of the social supports which I believe should have been beefed up were removed or eroded and that we did not see the scaling up that was needed in terms of ICU care.  Pre-Covid, bed capacity in ICU was 225.  The temporary surge capacity was approximately 350 and now our permanent capacity is just 280.  A move from 225 ICU beds to just over 280 beds is not an adequate response.<\/p> <p>One of the issues on which I focused at the time was ventilators.  As the Minister of State will know, certain companies in Galway were among the key global manufacturers in terms of ventilators.  They have shown great responsibility by sharing and open-sourcing some of their plans.  In March, the HSE ordered 900 new ventilators.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not clear whether they have arrived.  Where are they in the system?  Are they in high-dependency units, HDUs, or ICUs?  Intensive care and high-dependency units do not simply comprise ventilators - there are also ICU staff.<\/p><p>I echo others' concerns about the failure to drive recruitment.  We should never be in a situation of people walking away because they feel that they are not valued or being offered meaningful contracts in respect of their work.  For example, we want to ensure that student nurses do not leave our health system because they feel undervalued through not being paid properly.<\/p><p>I am concerned about ICU capacity.  Were other staff retrained to acquire ICU skills?  It has a specific set of skills.  The Minister of State referred to increasing home care hours.  When will there be a statutory entitlement to, and regulation of, home care?  I asked numerous questions but received unsatisfactory answers around the provision of PPE to those working in home care and in community and voluntary services that support people directly in their homes.  Will the State guarantee to provide them PPE?<\/p><p>Regarding those who wish to transition from residential care to home care, the Minister of State mentioned step-down services.  Was she referring to people who were leaving hospital or did she mean a potential route out of residential care for certain persons?<\/p><p>These are my key issues.  Other Senators have spoken about the flu vaccine.  I have asked questions of the Department about public sanitation and been told that it was a matter for local authorities.  Will the Department engage with local authorities on ensuring that there is public sanitation and that, accordingly, people can access sinks, toilets and spaces?  That has always been part of ensuring an appropriate response.  It is an issue, and not just for those with disabilities.<\/p><p>Mental health matters are a key focus for the Minister of State.  Waiting lists were already extraordinarily high, with 2,000 children awaiting child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and 10,000 people awaiting primary care.  The amount of &euro;30 million is not enough, and the Minister of State knows that there have been demands for &euro;80 million.  What can we do to step up?<\/p><p>Other Senators have spoken about home care and disability services.  Rehabilitation and recovery services for those with addictions are essential care and I hope that they will form part of the winter plan.<\/p><p>I realise that I am coming to the end of my time.  I wish to address a cost-cutting issue.  When we debate the HSE's winter plan, it has to be based on health and scientific advice.  That is fundamental.  I urge the Minister of State and her ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health to ensure that health is the driving factor.  While it is not within the remit of any Minister to produce a cure or treatment for the coronavirus, we see health concerns being set against supposed concerns about poverty and so forth by those who previously in the Seanad did not show particular concern for poverty.  Poverty and income, employment and business supports are issues to which we actually have the answers.  The IMF is urging us to borrow.  We have a large capacity.

The other issues can be addressed through borrowing and intensive spending, all of which we have the remit to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#JJ00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Senator, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#JJ00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>My apologies for straying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#JJ00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is becoming a regular visitor to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  If she keeps arriving with the good news that we got this morning, she will be a very welcome one.  I listened as she outlined the ambitious winter plan.  As the Acting Chairman knows, we have debated winter plans down the years where there was not a significant spend.  However, the mindset around healthcare has been recalibrated so that healthcare is not at the top of our political priorities.<\/p> <p>This time last year, we were discussing Brexit, which was the largest political challenge in our country's recent history.  While it remains a major political challenge, it is fair to say that all observers and commentators now realise that health is our single greatest political challenge.  We will not have a vibrant economic future unless we and our people are healthy.  Health and our economy are intrinsically linked - they are two sides of the one coin and deserve the same commitment in terms of resources, priority, effort and determination.  Since January, we have seen how our country and our people respond \"when our backs are to the wall\".<\/p> <p>Currently, we are dealing with a worldwide pandemic that has infected nearly 39,000 of our citizens.  On the island of Ireland, more than 2,000 people have, sadly, lost their lives.  Any winter plan has to reflect that backdrop, and this one does.  We are discussing spending hundreds of millions of euro in this winter plan and making beds available in accident and emergency units.  In the mid-west, an extra 60 beds will be opened on 9 November for patient treatment.  These are new beds and their opening is welcome.  I am not 100% sure whether it was a year ago today, yesterday or tomorrow, but 93 people were on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  The 60 beds will make a major difference when they open.  That is just one element of the winter plan, but it is a key component.<\/p> <p>Colleagues have alluded to other issues.  For example, the Minister of State is aware of mental health issues from her work in the previous D&aacute;il.  I agree with Senator Higgins that the Minister of State's work was genuine, determined and focused.  In politics, it is great to see someone with that determination getting the opportunity to execute it from a position of authority.  I do not doubt that, if the Government lasts the four and a half years, the Minister of State will be able to turn around and point to significant achievements in the fields of older people and mental health.  We wish her well and will stand in solidarity with her in her efforts to achieve those.<\/p> <p>The winter plan is appropriate and proportionate.  It has to be welcomed, but it also has to be implemented.  I look forward to standing in the Chamber in six months' time to review how the winter plan worked and the impact I hope it will have had.<\/p> <p>I will conclude by referring again to the pandemic.  As Oireachtas Members, we all have a responsibility to use our social media platforms to keep hammering home the message.  We are in level 3 and the situation is not easy.  There are people who this morning were told they would not have jobs until such time as we moved back to level 2.  We have a collective duty as leaders in our communities and society to encourage everyone to reboot his or her efforts.  I appeal to business people to do the simple things like keeping their hand sanitisers topped up.  The number of hand sanitisers one finds empty when going into buildings is amazing.  Regardless of whether we like it, complacency has sadly set in.  People became fatigued, but we must reboot and recalibrate now.  The only way that the Minister of State's winter plan can be successful is if we can break the coronavirus chain and reduce the number of people getting infected.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->With that, I wish the Minister of State well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#JJ00600","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate her on her elevation.  My colleagues have already addressed the issue of critical care bed capacity so I will focus on some of the other risks that exist within the HSE.  I will add that hearing the Minister on the radio the other day talking about building bed capacity over the next two years did not really inspire confidence in where we are going.  God help those who are sick with anything other than the coronavirus if things continue to spiral out of control.<\/p> <p>The winter plan states that a key underlying risk in its implementation is the risk of not being able to attract and retain the appropriate number and calibre of staff for key posts.  A significant number of such staff is required.  These posts cannot be offered on a permanent basis.  We attracted hundreds if not thousands of medical care workers back to this country to put on the green jersey during the Covid-19 pandemic and then we offered them nothing.  Some were not even offered jobs.  Meanwhile, I heard the director of a nursing home complaining yesterday that the HSE was stealing her staff, both special care assistants and nurses.  We cannot do this.  We have to treat the entire healthcare system as one unit.  This is the plan's Achilles' heel.  Having identified the risk, the plan should go on to mitigate against it.  What plans have been made to attract these staff?  They are highly qualified people.  We cannot offer them rubbish contracts.  If we are going to bring them in, we have to give them decent contracts. <\/p> <p>Additional funding for bed capacity is all well and good.  My colleague, Senator Annie Hoey, mentioned the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, in the last few minutes.  The plan sets out several ambitious targets but does not outline the number of extra staff that will be needed and recruited to achieve them.  For example, just five days ago there were 80 vacant nursing posts in three main hospitals in Kildare.  Some 25 of those posts were in Naas.  For months the INMO has sought a funded workforce plan for the HSE.  Where is it?  As far as I can see it is not in the winter plan.  It was forthcoming at the end of last month but it has been referred to the Workplace Relations Committee.  Do we have to go through a workplace relations dispute in order to solidify or create decent jobs for these people?<\/p> <p>What steps have been taken by the HSE to provide clarity for the nursing unions?  I fully support the proposal to care for those with high and moderate levels of frailty in their own homes.  That is welcome.  I also welcome the 4.7 million additional home support hours provided for in the plan.  Again, this is an ambitious target.  It is predicated on the ability to recruit staff, with Family Carers Ireland estimating the required figure at about 800.  We have to find 800 support staff for care in the home.  F&oacute;rsa is meeting the HSE today and the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, has already raised the issue.  It is frighteningly late in the day for the HSE to be discussing this when we know that healthcare workers have been severely and disproportionately affected by Covid-19.  A director of nursing in one nursing home was on the radio yesterday afternoon.  A neighbouring home had staff with Covid-19, including both care assistants and nurses.  She went over and volunteered in that nursing home.  The movement of caring staff from house to house will be a problem.  <\/p> <p>Family Carers Ireland has concerns about additional pressures on its members and the need for vital supports such as daycare, personal protective equipment, PPE, transport and essential therapies.  I could go on and on, but like most other people I am running out of time.  I appreciate our position regarding this plan but as in every other area affected by Covid-19, the chickens have come home to roost.  Years of underinvestment have left us facing into a hard winter.  This is not the Minister of State's fault but that of successive Governments.  God knows what is coming down the line if the measures being taken by the Government do not get public buy-in.  Today I read about nurses trying to get into Dublin facing a five-hour tailback because of the roadblocks Senator McDowell referred to earlier.  That is simply not good enough.  I apologise to the Acting Chairman for going over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#KK00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The Government has been in existence for more than 100 days but this is the first time I have had the opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State and wish her well in her new role.  It may be her first time in this House.  She is very welcome.  At the time this Government was being formed, people were crying out for a Government.  Fine Gael might not be the best friend of the Minister of State's party, although it is certainly its most competitive friend.  However, party differences were set aside.  Many would not step up to form a Government but the coalition parties put people before politics.  I hope history will be kind to the bravery of Fianna F&aacute;il's membership in providing stability in the teeth of a pandemic.  I am sure it will.<\/p> <p>I broadly welcome the plan the Government has outlined in recent days.  I have three concerns, which I hope the Minister of State will take on board.  The first is the problem which many doctors and pharmacists have reported, that is, a shortage of the flu vaccine.  It is a shame that this winter, of all winters, many practitioners are crying out for enough doses for their patients.  They are perplexed and worried.  They have received some supplies so far, but nothing like the amount required.  Perhaps a better explanation is due to those practitioners and their patients.  If there is a worldwide shortage I ask the Minister of State to say so.  Did this issue arise because the HSE did not order the vaccine in time?  This is not necessarily a criticism of the Minister of State. <\/p> <p>My second concern pertains to the Covid-19 assessment hubs.  We know about testing centres, but the assessment hubs play a vital role after a full consultation with a GP.  Many cases may not justify referral to an emergency department for further medical examination.  As such, we set up assessment hubs for those with respiratory symptoms at the beginning of the pandemic.  However, as I said in the House last week, we do not have any similar facility for those under the age of 16.  For those over 16 a third option exists, a safe place for further examination which cannot be carried out in a GP's surgery for obvious reasons, namely, the need for intensive cleaning and concerns about the safety of patients and medical practitioners.  I worry that large numbers of possibly unnecessary referrals will be made to paediatric emergency departments because there is no such facility for children. <\/p> <p>The third concern, which the Minister of State might take on board in due course, relates to beds in intensive care units, ICUs.  Before Covid-19 we had 225 such beds.  In April, at the peak of the first wave, we had approximately 354 beds.  I am open to correction on that point.  Those included makeshift beds in theatre recovery areas.  I understand that we now have 280 fully staffed beds.  In 2009 the HSE said that 579 ICU beds were required.  We are often just a little bit behind England, where hospital admissions have increased by 25%.  That figure does not refer to ICU admissions.  I am concerned that we do not have enough fully staffed ICU beds to ratchet up our response as necessary.  I hope the Minister of State can provide reassurance on that point.  I am concerned about overcrowding due to the toxic combination of the winter flu season and the challenge of Covid-19.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

I am delighted that she was appointed to the role because her dedication and passion for her portfolio, when in opposition, was second to none.  She is going to be a reforming Minister of State.<\/p> <p>A very famous television show called \"Game of Thrones\" had the tagline \"winter is coming\".  For us in this country it really is and it will be a winter like no other.  For us, the coronavirus  is our reality of the White Walkers and just as deadly.  The winter programme will be critical in so many aspects of society in keeping our systems functioning and our citizens healthy so I am glad of the extra &euro;600 million on top of our normal funding for this particular programme.  The medical card for the over-70s was a huge and very significant announcement.  With the coronavirus there is so much noise in our media and on the airwaves that hugely significant statements such as that by the Minister of State which are reforming and will make a huge difference may not be heard. <\/p> <p>The initiative is about keeping people safe in their homes, which is a huge issue that the Minister of State is passionate about.  I ask her to touch on home care support in her closing remarks.  We are all very conscious that there was already a backlog in the system.  Have the Minister of State and her Department analysed the anticipated surge that could arrive on top of the backlog?  In terms of GPs, I would like to know what services are under pressure in all of the constituencies and I would like to hear statistics on waiting times as a result of Covid.  I am very conscious that all of this plan, even things like community beds, are contingent on a large numbers of additional staff.  It is a wholetime equivalent of 868 new staff in terms of staffing the community beds initiative.  Is there a recruitment process in place to make sure that, come spring, the Department has time for that?<\/p> <p>I have been inundated with representations about disability services because people are anxious that their loved ones get the full-time care they had prior to Covid.

GPs have been under pressure and working on the frontline has meant many of them are exhausted.  GPs and their teams of nurses and other workers deserve a lot of praise.<\/p> <p>I agree with the concerns about the flu vaccine expressed by Senator Martin.  We must ensure that there is an adequate supply.  I know from talking to GPs in Wexford that there are still some concerns about supply.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise two specific issues about the plan.  The first issue concerns the community intervention teams.  Most counties are covered by community intervention teams with the exception of counties Longford, Westmeath, Mayo, Donegal and Wexford.  There is a plan to put community intervention teams in place but a commitment in the winter plan says that they may not be in place by March.  I hope that we will be out of our winter by March.  One of the big problems is that one in four GP practices in rural Ireland has only one GP and local cover is essential.  Therefore, community intervention teams must be in place to provide adequate access to healthcare.  <\/p> <p>I wish to comment on GP access to diagnostics.  Due to the fact that there is limited access many patients are being referred directly to hospital emergency departments, which is an inefficient use of resources.  The significant number of proposed additional diagnostics is welcome.  It will be nearly 34,000 by the end of this year and more than 45,000 in the first quarter of next year.  Who will perform the scans and X-rays?  Where will the staff be located?  How will GPs access all of the additional diagnostics?  That information must be clearly spelled out.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#LL00600","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Senator McGahon is next and I urge him to stick to just two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#LL00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Some Members spoke for 1 minute and 20 seconds more than their allotted time, which was rude, but I will stick to the time in deference to the Acting Chairman.<\/p> <p>As we have been delayed again because Senators spoke for too long I will scrap what I was going to say and focus on one issue.  Senator Elisha McCallion is absolutely correct in her call for an all-island approach to tackle Covid.  That is the one and only time in my career in this House, however long I will be here, that I will agree with Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Senator, like myself, is a Border politician so understands what the Border area is like and I only live a few miles from the Border.  We have seen huge increases in Northern Ireland and in Border constituencies so unless we have a dedicated Border plan to reduce Covid then there will be a really difficult winter experienced by communities like mine in Dundalk and north County Louth.  It is essential that our public health requirements and restrictions mirror as closely as possible the same restrictions in Northern Ireland.  It is madness.  There is no reason the South should be on level 4 and Northern Ireland on level 2 because it will lead to a lot of people criss-crossing the Border due to different restrictions.  At the minute there is good co-operation between the HSE, the NHS and various Departments but we need to massively increase that communication otherwise people living in Border communities will have a very dark winter indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#LL00800","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Last week, I addressed a number of issues concerning the flu vaccine and I welcome the measures that were brought in then.<\/p> <p>The winter plan is a step in the right direction but the journey is far from complete.  In its current form the HSE's winter plan is deficient in certain respects.  I refer to the gross under-utilisation of the 1,800 community pharmacists who serve communities across the country and never closed their doors to people in need during lockdown.  The Government gave a commitment to expand the role of community pharmacies in the programme for Government.  The Government pledged to include pharmacies as part of the initiative to enhance primary and community care, thereby making the vast majority of healthcare services available to people in the home or close to home rather than in overcrowded hospitals.  Now is the time to make good on that promise in the midst of a pandemic, when the need is so great, to maximise the use of all available resources and expertise.  This is imperative not only to protect the health of the public but also to ease the burden on our overworked GPs, hospitals, doctors and nurses.  There are a number of measures that could easily and quickly be introduced to improve the winter plan and further these objectives.  <\/p> <p>In terms of vaccinations, pharmacists are allowed to administer the pneumococcal vaccine to members of the older population.  However, there is an issue both with the provision of the vaccine doses and the funding to roll it out through community pharmacies.

Its introduction was announced in 2016 but the proposal seems to have sat on the shelf ever since.  There are other steps being taken to expand the role of pharmacies and relieve the ever-growing burden on GPs and hospital emergency departments.  This effort would be enhanced by the immediate establishment of the minor ailments service, which would provide accessible healthcare for a variety of common ailments via the existing network of community pharmacies.  We are lagging behind our neighbours in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland in this regard, where valuable primary care services are already provided through the pharmacy network.  There is further evidence of the value of the proposal in a study undertaken by the home medicines service in the UK, which indicated that a comprehensive pharmacy-based minor ailments service could take on up to 1 million unnecessary GP visits annually.  In the midst of the Covid pandemic, I know the Minister of State will see the value of introducing this scheme as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#LL00900","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I apologise that I cannot give the Senator any longer to speak but we are under pressure of time.

The Government's resilience and recovery plan is premised on doing everything we can to keep schools and childcare provision open.  As it transpires, minding children is the glue that keeps us together, except when it comes to maternity services.  I am sure the Minister of State has heard the expression \"happy mama, happy baba\".  There are many unhappy mamas at the moment because of the hospital restrictions that mean they have no one by their side during early pregnancy scans, anomaly scans, throughout the duration of the birth process and for post-partum services.  Expectant mothers are staring into a winter of more of the same.<\/p> <p>The Government made a decision on Monday to base our approach to Covid-19 not just on public health numbers but also on wider important social factors such as emotional well-being, mental health, which the Minister of State knows all about, and a holistic duty of care.  Can the same approach not be taken in regard to maternity services?  In response to a parliamentary question last week, the Minister said that any decisions on restrictions are made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level and that the national women and infants health programme has developed a guidance document on restrictions which seeks to provide a more consistent national approach to visitor restrictions.  It proposes, for example, that hospitals should review visiting arrangements every week.  Will the public have access to those reviews by way of hospital risk assessments and safety statements?  Is it possible for maternity hospitals to be brought into the resilience and recovery plan by way of the imposition of stepped restrictions from level 1 to level 4?  Surely women in such vulnerable positions can be prioritised rather than pushed to the back of the queue when it comes to reopening society.<\/p> <p>I recognise that these are very challenging times for maternity hospitals and I appreciate everything their staff do and are doing.  All I am asking for is communication, clarity and compassion.  I spoke yesterday to Claire Hanna, MP, who has raised the same issue in the House of Commons.  She has stood up for women in the North and I am doing the same today for women in this State.  The Royal College of Midwives has stated that having a trusted birth partner present throughout labour is known to make a significant difference to the safety and well-being of women during childbirth.  At a time when the coronavirus is heightening anxiety, that reassurance is more important than ever.

The investment in community healthcare networks is particularly welcome, as are the additional 4.76 million home support hours provided under the home first initiative.<\/p> <p>I want to raise an issue that is local to me.

Some strayed outside the remit of the winter plan but I will confine myself in my reply to addressing the questions that related to specific aspects of the plan.<\/p> <p>An issue raised by several speakers was the availability of the flu vaccine.  I was in the Seanad on two occasions last week to address matters raised by Senators Keogan and Paul Daly in the Commencement debate.  We had a very good debate in both instances.  I am happy to restate the situation in regard to the flu vaccine because I know there are worries in that regard.  Last year, 1.35 million vaccines arrived in Ireland, compared with a figure this year of close to 2 million.  A total of 600,000 of the vaccines are for children aged two to 12.  They will be administered free of charge and inserted through the nose, with no requirement for an injection.  That is very welcome and we hope it will be rolled out through the schools.  The remaining 1.35 million doses are of the quadrivalent vaccine, which is the one any of us will be administered.  I encourage everybody to avail of it.  Following a delay in delivery from the manufacturers, almost half of the vaccine doses have now been received.  By 18 October, 75% will have been distributed throughout the country.  The flu virus is not only in Ireland but worldwide and there is a huge demand for the vaccine.  We are on target to have 75% of our delivery distributed by 18 October.  That will make a huge difference.<\/p> <p>There were many questions on the disability sector.  I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber last night with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for a two-hour debate on disability services.  As Senator Cassells noted, sometimes good initiatives can be lost in the business of the everyday.  Senators will all be aware that the disability sector was in line for a 1% cost-cutting measure, which would have reduced its budget by &euro;20 million.  That decision was reversed since the Government came into office three months ago.  In addition, extra provisions of &euro;10 million and &euro;7.8 million were allocated in recent weeks for the delivery of disability services.<\/p> <p>Those services all stopped during the pandemic and it has been extremely hard on parents, carers and the people in receipt of care.  I am the first to admit that the situation for many people has been awful.  I held a round-table discussion with carers three weeks ago.  It had to be done online and the number of participants had to be reduced but it was a good opportunity to speak with carers.  Many of them told me that they had been housebound during the Covid crisis and had found it really hard.  To date, 40% of all disability supports are now back in place.  Most people who avail of those supports are getting two days one week and three days the following week.  There is a plan to increase that provision from October to December and another plan from January to March.  A huge amount of work is going on in this area.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That will also be addressed in the Estimates.<\/p><p>Many Senators raised critical care capacity.  It is a huge factor.  ICU beds do not grow on trees.  Every ICU bed has a cost of &euro;750,000 and needs six qualified nurses with specific skills.  It is very important to recognise that.  The HSE advises that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are fully staffed and open with the precise number on any given day fluctuating due to staffing or other operational factors.  We should note that our critical care units have coped well so far largely because the curve was successfully flattened at early stages, which meant they were not overwhelmed, and because of the incredible work carried out by critical care staff.  As a result, outcomes for Covid patients in ICU here compare well with other jurisdictions including the UK.  Mortality for Covid patients in Ireland's ICUs is reported at 21.5% whereas the figure in the UK is 41%.  We are very aware of the importance of ICU acute beds.  It is not simply a matter of putting the beds in tomorrow, however, because they must be accompanied by staff with a specific set of skills.  That is why it is quite difficult.<\/p><p>Many Members spoke about recruitment and retention.  Many doctors and nurses move onto other countries when they qualify, as they are entitled to do, where they hone their skills.  There will not be a movement of staff this year and we are hopeful that will help us to fill some of the issues.<\/p><p>I sat on the other side of the House for four and a half years.  Just one Senator referred to the inclusion in the winter plan of ten additional dementia advisers.  That is a very important feature of the plan.  When I was first elected to the Oireachtas, there were eight dementia advisers in Ireland.  As a result of pushing really hard with others on the all-party Oireachtas group on dementia, where members left politics at the door and worked really hard to secure more supports, we got ten posts in last year's budget.  I was very happy to speak at the launch of the winter plan two weeks ago when we announced ten more dementia advisers.  There are 65,000 people living with dementia here, with 11 people diagnosed every day.  It is very important to acknowledge there are many positives in the winter plan.<\/p><p>When I sat on the Opposition side of the House for four years, I criticised other winter plans that had a spend of &euro;30 million.  This year's spend is 20 times bigger.  That shows how seriously the Government is taking the need to keep our older people out of hospital this year, and to keep our older people at home with the correct wrap-around supports.  We need to ensure the people who need re-ablement can get it at home and can get the respite they refquire.  That is why &euro;139 million was spent on home care hours alone, with 4.7 million extra hours.  I have spoken to some of the private companies and the HSE and it will be a challenge but it is already happening.  Before the election, there were 7,900 people waiting on home care supports.  Yesterday, I was briefed that this number is now down to 4,300.  That is hugely significant.  We are already rolling out the hours.  I was told this by the person in charge of older person services in the south east.  It is a significant reduction, although it is not enough and I will not be happy until no one is waiting.<\/p><p>Diagnostics were raised by several Senators, who asked who will provide them.  Some of the details are yet to evolve, but GPs will be able to access 79,000 diagnostics, some of which will be acquired through the NTPF because we will be able to buy diagnostics for the first time ever.  Previously, it was possible to do this only in the case of treatments such as hip or cataract operations.  Primary legislation will be required to enable the purchase of diagnostics under the NTPF.  That will be very important.<\/p><p>I was surprised we did not hear much about nursing homes today.  It is a matter close to my heart.  Members will have heard in the last week or so that there has been a surge in Covid cases and clusters in nursing homes.  Every single nursing home has a sufficient quantity of PPE.  There have been challenges about staff moving to other areas, as Senator Keogan observed, but I have spoken to the HSE and we have asked the homes actively not to do that.<\/p><p>I wish to reassure people that the temporary assistance payment scheme, which supports nursing and residential homes, will be continued until next April.  That is significant.<\/p><p>I am sorry if I did not answer everything.  I could stay here for an hour and answer questions.  I thank Senators for their respect and their constructive approach this afternoon.  I hope they will all support the plan.  All we want to do is keep our people safe as we face the winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#MM00700","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602063000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.46 p.m. and resumed at 5.05 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Statutory Right to Sick Leave Pay: Motion","time":1602063000,"counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#PP00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:  \tacknowledges that:<br \/><br \/>- Ireland is one of only five countries in the European Union in which employees have no statutory right to be paid by their employer if absent from work due to illness;<br \/><br \/>- the decision whether to provide sick pay is entirely in the hands of employers under current legislation;<br \/><br \/>- standard illness benefit is only paid to full-time PAYE workers from the seventh day of an illness, provided 104 weeks of PRSI contributions have been built up plus a minimum number of payments in the relevant year, or previous year or two years, and further subject to a certificate of incapacity signed by a doctor who may charge the standard price of a GP visit;<br \/><br \/>- the enhanced Covid-19 illness benefit does not cover workers with illnesses other than Covid-19, and at &euro;350 a week, represents less than half the average private sector weekly wage;<br \/><br \/>- the comments made by An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, the Minister for Justice and other Government Ministers that the lack of paid sick leave provisions in this jurisdiction needs to be remedied;<br \/><br \/>- the widespread public support for paid sick leave in Ireland, as evidenced by an Ireland Thinks survey, showed 87% in favour of addressing the issue;<br \/><br \/>notes with concern:<br \/><br \/>- the pressing need to ensure, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, that workers who are ill or have Covid-19 symptoms do not feel pressured to attend work;<br \/><br \/>- the comments of the Acting Chief Medical Officer on 27th September, 2020 that NPHET has recommended measures be put in place to ensure that workers can afford not to attend work when they are sick;<br \/><br \/>- the reported low levels of workers with access to sick pay in both the meat preparation and childcare sectors, with 80% of workers in meat processing factories lacking sick pay schemes at work according to Meat Industry Ireland, and 79% of early years professionals lacking sick pay according to research by the SIPTU Big Start campaign;<br \/><br \/>- the position of parents whose children may be sent home from school or pre-school due to pandemic guidelines, and the arising difficulties for families where both work outside the home or, in the case of a single parent. in terms of balancing work commitments with the need to provide care for children;<br \/><br \/>- the disproportionate burden falling on mothers when it comes to caring for children while ill or restricting their movements, and the reliance by a majority of parents on annual leave to enable them to absent themselves from work to care for their children;<br \/><br \/>- that the legislative provision for force majeure leave is limited to three days in a twelve month period as contained in the Parental Leave Act 1998;<br \/><br \/>- the announcement by the Government that it will take up to six months to review the practicalities of introducing a statutory right to paid sick leave;<br \/><br \/>and calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>- expedite their consultation with trade unions and business representatives in order to urgently introduce a statutory right to paid sick leave for all employees;<br \/><br \/>- provide for a series of targeted and easy to access supports to employers who can demonstrate inability to pay sick leave during the course of the pandemic;<br \/><br \/>- amend, as an extraordinary measure, the Parental Leave Act 1998, in order to extend the existing statutory entitlement to force majeure leave for parents whose children&rsquo;s school or pre-school must close or restrict attendance in order to comply with pandemic guidelines, ensuring that the parent, indispensable to the needs of the child, can remain at home.  <\/blockquote> <p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Chamber for this Private Members' motion.<\/p><p>We are living through a global health emergency, a pandemic on a scale that very few of us could ever have imagined a few months ago, and so much of our lives have changed.  Unfortunately, it is in the<\/p><p>gaps in our social safety net that we now see the true impact of Covid-19.  From day one, we told ourselves that we are all in this together but, in truth, the pandemic has been no great leveller.  The language<\/p><p>of solidarity from the Government is all very well but the reality of the crisis is very different.  I refer to the widening gap between the haves and the have nots, those who have financial and job security and<\/p><p>those who do not, those who are able to work from home and those who cannot, and, above all, those who enjoy that basic employment right to full pay when they have to take time off from their work<\/p><p>because they are sick and those who do not.  The reality in Ireland at present is that workers do not enjoy that basic employment right to paid sick leave.  Workers in this country are entirely dependent on the<\/p><p>benevolence of their employer or where they have a collective agreement with their employer.<\/p><p>In this country, a minority of private sector workers have access to paid sick leave on the first day they become ill.  In certain sectors, particularly low-paid sectors such as the red meat sector, the numbers<\/p><p>with access to paid sick leave is as low as 10%.  In the childcare sector, another low-paid sector, SIPTU's Big Start campaign surveyed over 3,000 childcare workers and found that only 16% of workers in<\/p><p>that sector have access to paid sick leave.  While we do not have the precise numbers for right across the Irish labour market as to who does and does not have paid sick leave, we know from the data on<\/p><p>other employment rights, such as access to paid maternity leave, that the more workers earn the more likely they are to have access to paid sick leave and, of course, the converse of that, the less they earn<\/p><p>the less likely they are to have paid sick leave.<\/p><p>For those who do not have paid sick leave, what are they reliant on?  The reality is that they are left to rely on a wholly inadequate system of State supports with regard to illness benefit.  They must wait a<\/p><p>whole six days before accessing illness benefit.  What is worse is that the social welfare system excludes quite a significant number of workers, that is, workers who have less than two years' PRSI<\/p><p>contributions and who have not made PRSI contributions in the previous years.  Who are those workers?  They include young workers, workers who have taken long years out of the labour market and come<\/p><p>back into a job, and workers who have come back from abroad.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Labour Party motion is twofold; it is to highlight the wholly inadequate system that exists around supporting workers when they fall ill in this country but, more importantly, to say to the<\/p><p>Government that it can and must act soon.  I welcome the Government's commitment in the past fortnight to act.  I acknowledge its commitment to placing sick pay legislation on the Statute Book by the<\/p><p>end of next year.  However, I have to say to the Minister of State that waiting until next year is simply too late for the thousands of workers who are likely to become sick, either for reasons unrelated to Covid<\/p><p>or related to Covid, over the coming weeks and months.  I also acknowledge that the Government has responded in small part to the pandemic with regard to illness benefit.  We have an enhanced illness<\/p><p>benefit payment now but, at &euro;350 per week, it is less than half the average weekly earnings.  If one is struggling to make ends meet, the fact remains that without guaranteed paid sick leave, if one finds<\/p><p>oneself ill, one has to make that very difficult choice between the paid work that one really cannot afford to lose or making the right decision to stay at home and do right by oneself and by one's co-workers<\/p><p>and the rest of society.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important to state that paid sick leave is not a new, radical or extravagant notion.  A statutory entitlement to paid sick leave is seen as a basic right in 22 EU member states.  While Irish workers have not had that right, there has been a statutory sick pay scheme in the UK for many decades.  In Australia, it goes as far back as 1922.<br\/><br\/>Another important point regarding workers without access to paid sick leave concerns our inadequate social welfare system.  If we had paid sick leave, there would be no need for low-paid workers to rely on the State's illness benefit.  I am thinking in particular about people like Clare, who is a childcare worker in Carlow.  Clare became ill with the flu last January.  She goes to work looking after our children every day and allowing parents like me and many others to go to work as well.  Clare brings in less than &euro;400 per week.  When she became ill, she had to wait six days before being able to access sick pay to support herself and her family.  That situation requires immediate and drastic change, and it is within the wherewithal of the Government to make that change in the budget next week.<br\/><br\/>I understand that well-made policy that is meant to last takes time and needs to be teased out.  I appreciate that the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste have spoken with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, regarding the issues involved with the introduction of paid sick leave.  As stated in our motion, however, we believe the Government can expedite those consultations between the unions, employer representatives and the Government itself.  I state that because this issue concerns not only individual workers, but workplaces, the economy and society as a whole.<br\/><br\/>This is also about ensuring we deploy all available tools in the fight against Covid-19.  We must also face the fact, and this is why we are bringing forward this motion, that the absence of paid sick leave in this country is a fundamental weakness in the fight against Covid-19.  It is not just the Labour Party stating that.  The former acting CMO in the Department of Health, the CEO of the HSE and the clinical officer of the HSE have all acknowledged that the lack of paid sick leave is problematic in addressing Covid-19.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious that many businesses will look on the notion of paid sick leave as an extravagance and something they cannot pay.  However, can businesses afford for workers to take the chance of having one or more of the symptoms of Covid-19, coming into the workplace, infecting other workers and then that entire workplace shutting down?  There is a real question concerning how employers will respond.  In our pre-budget submission today, we put forward proposals regarding helping those employers that cannot afford to pay sick pay.  We did that because we recognise that there are employers who do the right thing and provide sick pay and there are also employers who can afford to pay but choose not to do so.  There are also employers who are still getting back on their feet and struggling to make ends meet, and they should be supported by the State.<br\/><br\/>There are three actions which the Government can take in the weeks to come, and especially in the context of the budget next week.  The first action concerns reducing the number of days that a worker who is ill must wait to access illness benefit.  I refer to workers who do not have Covid-19 but are facing other illnesses.  No worker should have to wait until the seventh day of illness to access illness benefit.<br\/><br\/>The second point is that the Government can move swiftly to extend the right to <i>force majeure<\/i>leave.  There is only a right to three days of <i>force majeure<\/i>leave in a 12-month period.  Any child isolating because of Covid-19 must do so for up to 17 days.  That will be unsustainable for parents relying on annual leave or paid leave.  Parents from all across the country have contacted me to say that they do not know what they are going to do if their children are out sick and must isolate in the weeks and months to come.<br\/><br\/>The third key initiative that the Minister could take concerns the extension or introduction of the right to collective bargaining.  The reality is that where paid sick leave exists in workplaces, that right has come about because of collective agreements between workers and employers.  I refer to employers recognising the right of workers to come together and negotiate, and it has been collective bargaining that has delivered the majority of workplace rights and benefits.<br\/><br\/>I conclude by stating that the lack of sick pay is far from the only issue exposed by this pandemic.  In the months to come, we want to bring forward legislation concerning bogus self-employment.  The Minister of State is aware that this issue has been very cruelly exposed in recent months and particularly in meat factories.  I refer to workers who fell ill and who believed they had been employed by an Irish employer.  When they went to the social welfare system, however, those workers could not access illness benefit because they had actually been employed by an agency located in another country.  This issue does not just concern migrant workers who have come into the country.  I have been contacted by an Irishman who stated that he only realised he was bogusly self-employed when he became ill.  For the Labour Party and for me, introducing the right to paid sick leave is the minimum the Government can do to help workers and employers to address and minimise the risk posed by Covid-19 and ensure workers do not have to be out of pocket but will have certainty and clarity in their lives and in their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#PP00300","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Sherlock.

It also gives me great pleasure to speak following my colleague, Senator Sherlock, who has spoken so eloquently to propose the motion.  She has done an enormous amount of work on pushing for the introduction of the right to paid sick leave.  As we state in our motion, it is extraordinary that Ireland is one of only five countries in the EU without a statutory sick pay scheme.  Some 22 EU member states have such a scheme in place.<\/p> <p>It is very disappointing for us in the Labour group to see the Government's proposed amendment to our motion.  It is not surprising given what happened in the D&aacute;il with our Bill, but it is disappointing.  It is particularly disappointing to see the very minimal text used in the Government's amendment.  We have pointed out that the Government has stated that it will take up to six months to review the practicalities of introducing a statutory right to sick leave.  As Senator Sherlock stated, we acknowledge that the Government has recognised the benefit of such a scheme and stated that it might take up to six months.<\/p> <p>In the Government's amendment to our motion, however, there is not even a mention of that minimal timeframe.  Instead, there is just a very weak commitment to consider reforms and improvements and to engage in consultation.  We are disappointed about that.  We are being reasonable and we note that consultations are ongoing.  We are simply asking the Government to expedite those consultations so that we are no longer among this small minority of five EU member states without a sick pay scheme.  When one looks at international comparisons, we see that the Netherlands has a right to two years of sick pay at 70% of a worker's wage, while in Sweden there is a right to two weeks at 80% of a worker's wage.  There are, therefore, some very generous examples.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In Ireland, by contrast, many workers, mainly those in non-unionised private sector employment, often feel under pressure to continue working when they are sick.  Of course, that has implications in the context of the enormous challenges posed by Covid, which really makes the case for expediting the introduction of paid sick leave now, rather than in six months' time.  The OECD stated that, in the context of coronavirus, paid sick leave plays a key role in protecting incomes, health and jobs during a health-driven labour market crisis.  That is a crucial point, particularly as we moved to level 3 nationally from midnight last night.<br\/><br\/>As Labour Party spokesperson on children, disability, equality and integration, the motion makes enormous sense.  It makes sense from the point of view of children and parents.  On 22 September, my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, received a reply to a parliamentary question he had tabled.  The reply revealed there had been 63 incidences of Covid-19 in 62 early years services.  However, as noted in the motion, research conducted by the SIPTU Big Start campaign indicates that 79% of childcare workers do not have access to sick pay.  Most of them earn less than the living wage.  Parents are placed under pressure if they have to stay at home to mind children who are sick or need to isolate because another person in the childcare facility or school is sick.  We have called for an extension of the statutory entitlement to <i>force majeure<\/i>leave in those circumstances because we want childcare workers and teachers, as well as parents and children, to be protected by law.<br\/><br\/>On disability rights, we are conscious of the importance of a right to paid sick leave because many workers in the 80% of nursing homes in the State that are privately operated are on low pay and may be vulnerable without an entitlement to sick leave.  Ireland has one of the lowest rates in the EU of employment of people with disabilities.  Statutory sick pay may enable more people with disabilities to participate in the labour market.  This is not just about people with disabilities who are patients in nursing homes or care homes.  It is also about enabling people with disabilities to work and enter the workplace.<br\/><br\/>On equality and integration, an article I wrote which was published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in June addressed the gendered effects of the pandemic and the disproportionate way in which the pandemic has affected women.  We know that women are more likely to have to take time out of the workplace to care for children or others who are ill.  The majority of lone-parent families are headed by women.  The lack of a statutory sick pay scheme impacts disproportionately on women.  Such a lack also impacts disproportionately on those from migrant communities.  There are approximately 16,000 undocumented workers in the country, many of whom work as front-line carers upon whom our care system depends.<br\/><br\/>For all of the reasons I and my colleagues have outlined, I urge the Minister of State and fellow Senators to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#QQ00500","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I thank Senator Sherlock for her considerable work on the Sick Leave and Parental Leave (Covid-19) Bill 2020 which recently went through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and for her work in preparing the motion.  When a government has no moral argument against a proposal, it seeks to kick it down the road.  Unfortunately, that seems to be the approach being taken in the Seanad this evening.  The issue will be given a further kick along the wrong road to be dealt with in six months' time or longer, as my colleagues stated.<\/p> <p>Irish workers have no legal right to be paid by their employer when absent from work because of illness.  Whether to pay sick pay is entirely the decision of the employer.  There is no legal obligation on an employer to so do.  The comments of Dr. Ronan Glynn, who was until recently the acting Chief Medical Officer, CMO, have been mentioned and it is important to revisit them.  He recently stated that the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, had recommended to the Government that whatever measure needs to be put in place should be put in place to ensure that workers who are sick can afford not to attend work.  He effectively stated that the introduction of sick pay was important to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and recommended several weeks ago that the Government take action.  So far, the Government has done nothing except to say it will launch a consultation process.  The can is ready for another kicking.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that we are all in this together but, unfortunately, there are those who are more in it than most.  I refer to those working in meat plants in particular and those who are left with no option but to continue going to work while sick.  In every interview given by the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in recent days regarding moving to a new level of restrictions, he cited the success of interventions in County Kildare, my county.  The real issue in County Kildare and the major cause of the outbreak came from meat factories and the fact that those workers went to work while sick because there was no sick pay scheme of which they could avail.  I am sure all Senators are aware of the stories of workers using Calpol and other medication to lower their temperature to ensure they could go to work and afford the basics of life, such as food and rent.<\/p> <p>The Labour Party motion is trying to address that issue and help those workers to afford the basics when they are sick.  Many such workers are front-line workers who are essential in so many ways.  An equally important aim of the motion is to try to protect those workers' communities and the wider public and stop the spread of this dreadful disease.  I ask Members to support the motion and leave the can alone for another day.  Let us bring in a sick pay scheme that will help to fight Covid and protect the most vulnerable workers and their communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#RR00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Government amendment to the motion.  We accept that neither the current regime for sick leave nor the parental leave system was designed for the current pandemic.  Although there is no legal right to sick pay from an employer, employees who are not entitled to sick pay from their employer may be able to avail of illness benefit from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Collective bargaining has achieved sick leave safety nets for many workers, but such agreements are not equally prevalent across all sectors.  In such circumstances, it is right that supports be reviewed, as has already been agreed.<\/p><p>We are keenly aware that many businesses are struggling to keep their doors open.  That is certainly the case in Galway city and beyond.  All Senators are aware of the impact of the ongoing pandemic on many industries, including hospitality, tourism, the events industry, international travel, transport providers and many more.  Changes which could result in additional costs for businesses need to be developed in careful consultation with those businesses and unions.  There may also be a cost to the State involved.  The proposed timeline will allow that important engagement to take place.  As the Taoiseach has stated, issues around access to sick pay are very important and the Government must start working towards a sustainable sick pay regime.  The consultation will be completed as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The motion follows on from the Sick Leave and Parental Leave (Covid-19) Bill 2020 which was recently debated in the D&aacute;il.  Although it did not oppose the Bill, the Government brought forward an amendment which proposed that the Bill would be deemed to have been read a second time in six months' time to allow consultation in the meantime by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation with unions and employers on the issues likely to arise from the Bill.  The Government has committed to completing that consultation as soon as possible.  As has been outlined, there is no legal right to be paid sick leave, but illness benefit is available.  Employers may decide their own policy on sick leave whether to provide payment while employees are off work sick.<\/p><p>Section 2 of the recent Sick Leave and Parental Leave (Covid-19) Bill 2020 provides for paid sick leave at the normal rate of pay after the first four weeks of employment for a period of six continuous weeks or a total of 30 days in any 12-month period.  As drafted, this would place an onus on employers to provide all of this pay.  Section 3 provides for an unlimited period of <i>force majeure<\/i>leave, as outlined by Senator Sherlock, for a parent or guardian who must care for a child who is sick or where there is a Covid-19 related closure of a school or preschool.  Section 4 provides for protections to ensure that employers are not disadvantaged by elements of the Bill, that collective agreements are recognised, and that more generous arrangements are protected.  Section 5 provides for recourse to the Workplace Relations Commission where a complaint arises, similar to the process relating to complaints regarding a worker's entitlement to annual leave.  Section 6 provides that nothing within the Bill amends the law relating to grounds that would justify the dismissal of an employee.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ollie Crowe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Labour Party proposals would place responsibility on employers to provide six weeks' paid leave.  Such a responsibility, while welcome for employees, could potentially be onerous for employers.  It could be particularly severe for small businesses, SMEs and businesses in which there is a large outbreak of Covid-19.  While the spirit of the Labour Party motion is not opposed, it is vital that employers and unions are given an opportunity to give input to any forthcoming legislation, ensure that it is workable and that jobs generated by employers are not put under pressure by increased costs.<\/p><p>When a worker is told to self-isolate by a doctor or the HSE due to being a probable source of infection or has been diagnosed with Covid-19 by a doctor, he or she can apply for the illness benefit payment per week.  I urge the Government to increase that payment back to &euro;350 which was previously in place.<\/p><p>All employees other than some public sector employees who pay a modified rate of social insurance and self-employed people, including non-nationals and people living in direct provision, are entitled to claim and receive Covid-19 illness benefit where conditions are met.<\/p><p>In response to the current need for Covid-19 supports for parents, the Government is examining the possibility of extending parental leave and benefit from two weeks to five weeks for each parent and extending the period in which this leave can be taken.  Each parent is now entitled to 26 weeks of parental leave.  The Government proposal would mean that eligible parents of the children born during the pandemic crisis will get an extra three weeks' parental leave to offset the impact of having a child during the strict lockdown measures.  The period in which parental leave can be taken will also be extended from one year to two years.  This, and the related costs, will be considered as part of the budget next Tuesday.  The support is paid at a rate of &euro;245 per week by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p><p>There are other areas in which the Government has requested employers to be as flexible as possible.  It has put pressure on them to allow staff to take time off after their children are born during the pandemic.  Some of the flexible options include: offering paid compensatory leave; allowing employees to work from home; alternating shifts so that employees can co-ordinate caring between themselves and their partners or another person; allowing employees to rearrange holidays; and allowing them to take paid time off that can later be worked back.  Where it is possible to make appropriate compassionate leave arrangements, employees may be able to call on some statutory entitlements, including parental leave together with parental benefit, or carer's leave together with carer's benefit or allowance.  Under the proposals in the Labour Party Bill, a new statutory entitlement to six weeks' paid sick leave would have to be created.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#RR00400","speaker":"1646","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;welcomes:<br \/><br \/>- the recent introduction of a new social insurance-based paid parental benefit scheme and extended parental leave rights;<br \/><br \/>- the Government&rsquo;s intention to examine a further extension of this leave in response to Covid-19 and acknowledges that work is underway in this regard;<br \/><br \/>acknowledges:<br \/><br \/>- that the &euro;7.4 billion July stimulus package was in addition to the existing measures totalling &euro;12 billion in supports for Covid-19 impacted businesses announced earlier in the year, including liquidity supports, rates waivers from local authorities and the warehousing of tax liabilities of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by Revenue;<br \/><br \/>resolves that An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands will progress consultations with unions and employers as quickly as possible, which will allow for:<br \/><br \/>- consideration of reforms and improvements to Ireland&rsquo;s statutory sick pay laws and any related change to illness benefit which is funded through PRSI contributions as referred to in the Programme for Government;<br \/><br \/>- research into the extent and exact nature of the problems being experienced, including a full evaluation of the costs that a Statutory Sick Pay Scheme would place on employers, particularly micro, small and medium sized enterprises that have been severely hit by Covid-19 and have required a suite of State supports to help them deal with the challenges;<br \/><br \/>- consideration of other practical issues and consequences that may arise, such as increased business costs and business viability,as a result of the proposals; and <br \/><br \/>- to consider other options for change which might be available, and which would not make it more difficult for employers to remain viable.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote> <p>I thank my colleagues from the Labour Party for proposing the original motion.  I am supporting the amendment I have moved.<\/p><p>There is nothing unreasonable in the proposals.  The only things that are unreasonable are the times in which we are living.  Ireland is one of only five countries in the EU in which employees have no statutory right to be paid by their employer if absent from work due to an illness.  The pandemic has revealed a vulnerability that must be addressed, a safety net staff and the State need.  The lack of statutory employee sick pay in Ireland is a reflection of the challenges faced by previous Governments and a general acceptance of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It has been on the radar but has not been prioritised enough.  A cursory glance at the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in 2020 general election manifestos, for instance, reveals no reference to statutory sick pay that I could see.  <\/p><p>When people are sick, they need to put recovery first, not worry about household finances.  As a modern, caring State, we must reduce any barriers to staying at home and safe.  Never has this been more important.  I welcome the commitment of the T&aacute;naiste and hope for the same from the Minister of State, Deputy English, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Minister for Justice and Equality, as well as broad support across our party and the Government, to research the extent and exact nature of the problems being experienced by workers.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection will consider reforms to statutory sick pay laws and any related change to illness benefit, funded through PRSI.  This was already committed to in the programme for Government but the timing is right to do it now and with urgency.  With cross-party support, I hope those Ministers will succeed where others have not.<\/p><p>It is true that paid sick leave is entirely at the discretion of employers but much has been done to enhance illness benefit during the pandemic.  The rate has been increased to &euro;350 per week for all employees no matter their PRSI contributions.  Any employee with Covid-19 symptoms who is required to self-isolate or is a probable source of infection has access to that payment.  The payment is made from the first day of illness so there are no waiting days.  It applies for two weeks for a person who is a probable risk of infection and up to ten weeks for a person who is diagnosed with Covid-19.  I am told that payments are now being processed in approximately one week.<\/p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;599 million on illness benefit alone in 2020.  More than 60,000 workers have availed of it so far, including front-line agency workers, meat factory workers, childcare workers, the self-employed, delivery drivers, zero-hour contractors and more.  There is still some necessary rigmarole around applying for the Covid-19 illness benefit.  An applicant requires his or her doctor to send a medical certificate to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and wait for the okay.  Even though the benefit is back paid once an application is approved, access to seamless sick pay maintained at the right level of benefit would be the best approach now and going forward.  In the North, for instance, statutory sick pay stands at &pound;95.98 per week for up to six months.  We can and should do better than that.<\/p><p>Some contributors to this debate over the past couple of weeks, not those who have spoken today, have referred to the Government's willingness to rush Covid-19 legislation through on other issues but not on this matter.  They have said that if we are supporting businesses through this crisis, we should push for reform or get something back from them.  Business owners have given us enough by going against every instinct they have to shut down their businesses and watch their revenues fall by 70% or more while paying fixed costs, week after week.<\/p><p>Statutory sick pay is our commitment to supporting sick workers at all times and not just in times of crisis.  We must remember that many Irish employers already pay contractual sick pay, but this step provides for situations where employers do not.  The legislation requires collaboration, not coercion, from small and medium-sized enterprises.  That is what the T&aacute;naiste has committed to doing and has already begun in earnest with trade unions and business representatives.<\/p><p>A particular body of work is required for early years professionals and healthcare staff to address pay and retention issues and problems.  This is a separate piece of work that the Minister with responsibility for children, disability, equality, integration and youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has taken on and must be addressed as soon as possible for childcare providers, workers, parents and children.  I absolutely agree and have previously referenced that a disproportionate burden fell on women during lockdown and falls to them if children are sick or unable to go to school or preschool.  That pressure is even more acute for single or lone parents.  When some people's work-life balance improved during the pandemic, others disintegrated as they juggled home-schooling and home-working.  It underlines the difference between the potential of flexible and remote work, and working from home during a pandemic, which are two very different things.  I welcome, therefore, the Government's commitment to examine the extension of parental leave in response to Covid-19.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It took a global pandemic to make us reconsider how we do things, especially how we work.

Some of the letters I have seen with respect to teachers with underlying health conditions are frightening, where the occupational health service says a person is in a high-risk capacity but not a very high-risk capacity, that he or she would be eligible to continue in his or her teaching role but can only teach one student and must be protected here, there and everywhere.  Effectively what they are doing is kicking back the issue of ill health or underlying conditions to the school board of management.  I know that the Minister of State will probably have sat on a school board of management.  It is unfair.  Boards of management are not qualified to deal with these issues.<\/p> <p>I support fully my colleagues in the Labour Party with this motion.  Covid has shone a light into the dark area of employment law and significant issues faced by low-paid workers in many sectors.  The absence of any legal right to sick pay by an employee in this country is scandalous, especially in a strong First World economy that is part of the European Union.  Employees in meat processing factories recently had to make a choice between their income and health, which is unacceptable.  That they had to do that during a highly contagious pandemic is unconscionable, a pandemic in which not only their own health was put at risk but also the lives of the people they shared the community with.<\/p> <p>We are now caught in the strong swell of a second wave that can be traced back to the first outbreaks in the meat factories after a very successful lockdown, but the lack of legislation on the issue of mandatory sick pay has failed us for far too long, and all in the name of profit.  The argument is made that the State already provides for sick workers through illness benefit subject to a number of qualifying conditions.  For the information of the Minister of State, Members of both this House and the Lower House who lost their seats in the previous election will not qualify for sick pay, should they be lucky enough to find employment, for some time to come because of class K PRSI, which is something that really needs to be examined.  We are using the PRSI code as a tax.  Who would pay for insurance and get nothing for it?<\/p> <p>With the increasing number of workers on short-term contracts, otherwise known as precarious employment, many find it difficult to accrue the necessary contributions and, when ill, find themselves without any income at all.  Many are hired overseas, and even though they work in Ireland, they pay no PRSI contributions.  Again, there are precarious employment situations, especially in construction.  I had the occasion to report an incident of builders' labourers, men with shovels and wheelbarrows, being declared self-employed on building sites purely to get around the PRSI and tax code.<\/p> <p>We know that companies operate in very tight environments and compete for the lowest cost.  We know that every penny counts, but in calculating and deciding what profit level a company needs to survive and thrive, sick pay should be factored in as a given and firmly rooted in employment law.  As it is, there is far too much exploitation, particularly of migrant workers who work mainly in the construction, hospitality, caring, retail, food and processing industries.  The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland said recently, \"The prevalence of exploitation and routine breaches of basic employment standards in the sectors examined is staggering.\"  We have workers in this country who are not even given the pay they are legally entitled to, and on top of that, they do not have any sick pay.  Indeed, a person contacted me recently who was told by one of these employers who employs people from outside the country that they were paying emergency tax and should contact the Revenue Commissioners to recoup the tax they had paid.  When the person contacted the Revenue Commissioners, the person was advised that Revenue had not received any tax in the name of this person after six months.  There is something wrong with the fact that we are allowing that to go on.<\/p> <p>Being part of a race to the bottom in employment conditions and law is something that Ireland should not be proud of.  We should be deeply embarrassed by it.  Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, recently said that \"up to half of the labour force, including hundreds of thousands of low-paid essential workers, do not receive sick pay and ... [are] financially compelled to keep on working when sick\".  Right now, in the middle of this Covid crisis, the lowest paid in our society - the cleaners, refuse collectors and people like that - are treated in an appalling way.  My own view is that these workers should be paid the same money as consultants because without them we would all be sick.<\/p> <p>For workers who are fortunate enough to have sick pay as part of their contract of employment, I would also recommend taking out income continuance insurance for those who can afford it.  We need a State-based income continuance insurance so that where an employee gets sick he or she would be guaranteed up to 75% of his or her salary.  I applaud organisations like SIPTU, Forf&aacute;s, the Irish Nurses and  Midwives Organisation, INMO, the Garda Representative Association, GRA, the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, and the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO - I could go on.  All of these unions have done what the State could not.  They have done deals with insurance companies to ensure that their members have access to income continuance insurance.  Unfortunately, with the way precarious employment has gone and short-term contracts, an awful lot of these people who once held cherished jobs in this country - being a nurse, teacher or any of those things once was a cherished career - sadly, they have now become short-term positions and are of little value.<\/p> <p>Employees' income must be guaranteed at every stage in the life cycle.  Going back to the teachers I spoke about at the outset, if a teacher is told by the occupational health people that he or she is high risk but not very high risk, the board of management says that person cannot not come to work and to go back to his or her GP, and the GP says he or she is not prepared to certify that teacher to go into a school and teach, after a period that teacher drops off the sick leave payment within the Department of Education and Skills and becomes broke, which is simply not on.<\/p> <p>I welcome the motion tabled by the Labour Party.  Once again, I am delighted to see the Labour Party row in four-square behind the trade union movement and workers of this country, and I congratulate it on bringing the motion forward.  I hope what we do not have is lip service paid to this motion.  I hope what we do have is the Minister of State and his Government colleagues coming forward with a complete suite of welfare for workers.  We have learned over the past six months just how important the lowest paid workers in this country are - the front-line cleaners, refuse collectors, receptionists and office staff - and it is time we started to treat them the way we would like to be treated ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#TT00300","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>It is nice to see the Minister of State and he is very welcome.  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome the motion on sick pay, which will have our full support.  I also welcome the speeches made by my colleagues in the Labour Party.<\/p> <p>Where do I begin with sick pay?  I will begin with my own experience of working as a trade union official with red meat workers.  What is not often said, and it needs to be said, is that our red meat industry is rife with exploitation.  We are not talking about a few bad apples.  We are talking about an industry that is rife with exploitation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When I worked with those workers, I could see first-hand the back-breaking work they undertook and the repetitive strain injuries they regularly got, but of course they had to work because there was no sick pay.  As we heard from one of our colleagues, 90% of them do not have sick pay.  What does it tell us about a massively profitable industry when it decides that 90% of its workers are not worthy of sick pay, even given the back-breaking savage workload these workers undertake?  It is not a coincidence, of course, that the vast majority of these workers are foreign nationals and somehow it is almost that they are out of sight so, therefore, they are out of mind.  It is a disgraceful industry and I want to put that on the record of the House.  We have heard too many times about our wonderful exports.  Talk to the people who work in those factories.  Examine what they have to put up with and remember that when we tried to organise them in SIPTU, they were fired, not once, not twice but every time in every factory.  This is the reality of our red meat industry.  Is it not shocking that one of the most profitable industries in the country denies sick pay to people?<\/p><p>I want to give a second example, which is private nursing homes.  I did a lot of work with private nursing home workers, and when we look at their contracts of employment they are quite shocking.  I have one here.  They are expected to work all hours, day and night, including weekends, for a flat rate of pay.  There is no additional rate of pay for weekends.  I am not speaking about one bad example, I am speaking about one of the industry leaders.  This is the standard in these private for-profit nursing homes.  Again, I put it to the Minister of State that there is no sick pay in this sector.  Think about that.  In a sector such as this they work with vulnerable elderly people.  We know all too well from Covid how vulnerable these workers are, but there is nothing to be said for it.<\/p><p>The question I would ask is how we got here.  How is it we are so out of sync with the rest of Europe?  Just looking at some of the schemes throughout Europe, in Germany employers must pay a sick worker's full wage for up to six weeks and in France, sick workers are paid for 60 to 90 days, with 90% for the first 30 days.  In Finland, legislation compels the employer to pay nine days of full salary, but through collective agreements workers usually receive sick pay for up to one month and other workers and civil servants receive sick pay for even more than three months.  What is it about the Irish workforce that successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael governments, successive conservative governments, never felt it was worth doing something in this sector?  I will address Senator Currie's point.  We can go back as far as 2012 to see Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' business on this.  We have been consistent on this issue and the need to legislate on it.<\/p><p>It is clear that it is about class politics.  It is about the people in these factories not coming into the minds of either of the conservative parties.  They never have done.  Let us look at the key calls the Labour Party has made.  The first is to expedite consultation with trade unions and business representatives to introduce urgently a statutory right to paid sick leave for all employees.  Who could possibly disagree with this line?  The motion also calls for the provision of a series of targeted and easy-to-access supports to employers who can demonstrate an inability to pay sick leave during the course of the pandemic.  It is very important that we put in place supports for small and medium-sized businesses in particular.  It also calls for amendment of the Parental Leave Act 1998.  There was no need for this really weakly worded, poor Government amendment.  I was going to use bad language there but I did not.  There is no need for it.  Why can the Government not agree with these three simple calls?  I would like the Minister of State to respond to this.<\/p><p>Look at the Government's amendment.  It calls for consideration of reforms and improvements to Ireland's statutory sick pay laws.  We do not have any statutory sick pay laws.  What we did have at the beginning of 2014 was a move from three days to six days before workers could access sick pay.  That is the Fine Gael record.  Unfortunately, it was Joan Burton in the chair at the time.  I welcome the fact there is broad progressive agreement on this point and on pursuing it.  We have to do better for working people.  My worry is exactly what Senator Wall referenced earlier.  I am not convinced, and in fact looking at the amendment I am less convinced than ever, that the Government has any real intention to deal with this issue.  There is no reason the Government could not have supported the three key points in the Labour Party's motion and given us real encouragement that this huge gap in workers' rights will be addressed sooner rather than later, but it has not happened.<\/p><p>There are so many references here.  The Council of Europe has called us out on our lack of sick pay.  The European Social Charter condemned the UK, which actually has some degree of sick pay, as being manifestly inadequate and not in conformity.  Where does that leave us?  We have absolutely nothing.<\/p><p>I am disappointed because the Minister of State had an opportunity to show goodwill and real intent but instead he has come up with this weakly worded, vague, nondescript nonsense.  I challenge the Government representatives because word will go out, and there is no doubt about it, that a simple motion such as this which deserves support has not received it and, instead, the Government has engaged in a kicking the can down the road episode.  There is no need for a six-month period.  The employers and unions could get this worked out in three months.  That would have been a much more reasonable timeframe and we could have got real results for these workers, who have been abandoned not just through Covid but for years and decades before this.  We can and must do better.  I hope the Minister of State can give us something more positive than this appallingly weak amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#TT00500","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I warmly commend the Labour Party on tabling the motion.  It is very important.  This is the type of emergency measure we should be seeing.  I have seen a lot of other things we are told are urgent moving through the House, sometimes questionably.  This is the type of thing that is urgent.  It relates directly to the Covid-19 circumstance and it also addresses a long-standing massive gap in Ireland's labour legislation.<\/p> <p>I am incredibly disappointed by the Government's amendment.  There is absolutely nothing in the motion that should not be accepted.  In fact, this is not even a Bill that the Government is seeking to postpone.  The Labour Party motion simply asks that consultation be expedited.  Does the Government not agree with expediting this issue and recognising it as urgent?  It seems extraordinary because there is absolutely nothing in the three reasonable points with which to disagree and nothing that ties the Government's hands on any consultation process.  In fact, it encourages a consultation process.  It is extraordinarily disappointing.<\/p> <p>I am particularly disappointed with the last line of the Government's amendment, which points to the nub of the issue.  We heard in the D&aacute;il that the Government simply wants to delay this so we can really work on statutory sick pay and get it right, but the very last line of the amendment states the Government should consider other options for change that might be available and might not make it difficult for employers to remain viable.  This is stating the Government does not want to introduce statutory sick pay and is looking to do something else instead.  This is what is in the Government's amendment.  I will strongly oppose it.  The Government is looking at alternatives to statutory sick pay.<\/p> <p>Just so we know, others have listed that in Belgium workers are entitled to 30 days' sick leave at 100%, in Finland it is nine days, and in the Netherlands there are two years of sick leave at 70%.  There are five other countries that do not have a statutory entitlement but, in fact, these countries have collective agreements.  These are countries such as Denmark which have even stronger entitlements to sick leave.  They do not have statutory entitlement because they do not need it because they have proper recognition of collective bargaining and union rights.<\/p> <p>With regard to why we need this to be statutory and no alternative will do, I will quote from an interview on \"Prime Time\" on RT&Eacute; with the director of, AA Euro Group, one of the main agencies that provide staff.  He stated the agency did not pay sick pay and that the legal requirement for employers in the private sector in Ireland is that they do not have to pay sick pay.  He said it would come down to an agency directive, and if the factories were paying sick pay, by all means the agency would do exactly the same thing because it would be able to charge for it.  He also stated it is a legislative issue for the Government.  He stated that if there were a level playing field in legislation, they would all be in the same boat and would definitely pay sick pay if that were the case.  This is the meat industry telling us it will only do this if it is required to do so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Let us be clear and not have meat barons and other companies hiding behind the small and micro business owner that we have heard about.  We must protect small and micro businesses and we have mechanisms to do so.  The Labour Party motion explicitly provides for a series of easy to access, targeted supports to employers who can demonstrate inability to pay sick leave.  They are addressing that.  The inability-to-pay mechanism is one we have to ensure there should never be a case where a business goes under because it is not able to pay a statutory entitlement for a period.  The inability-to-pay mechanism is one of the measures we already have because we recognise that businesses go through hard times.  We help businesses when they are struggling or when they are in ill health and we hope that they will recover.  The least we could do is to do the same for the workers.  If we are giving the many and lengthy supports to business we have discussed in this House, we must also show that we value and care for workers.  We have heard about them being essential workers.<br\/><br\/>There have been two very negative signals this week, one being the frankly pathetic increase of 10 cent in the minimum wage at a time when we know 23% of Irish workers are in the low-paid bracket, 40% of workers are in insecure work, and according to the 2017 figures, 44% are at risk of poverty if they were not getting social transfers.  That is the level of economic vulnerability and poverty that we have among workers in Ireland and we have chosen not to increase the minimum wage, not to include adequacy as a key factor in the minimum wage and now we are saying sick pay is not a concern when we know it is a major factor for insecure workers.<br\/><br\/>We know many of the meat barons were on the rich list last year.  Farmers were protesting outside one meat factory because although it had made a profit of &euro;3 million it would not give a decent payment to farmers.  Let us not have these people hiding behind the small businesses.  The State is the main customer of the companies providing early years education, so the State can make sick pay a provision for those doing that most essential work that was even required at the height of the crisis.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by coming back to Dr. Ronan Glynn, who as deputy CMO affirmed that whatever measures need to be in place should be put in place to ensure that workers who are sick can afford not to attend work.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation would be wise to listen to the fact that he can put social measures in place.  Rather than asking NPHET to change its scientific information and to change the real facts in terms of medical, health and scientific facts around a virus, on which it can only report to us, it cannot change the facts.  Instead, for example, he can take action on those measures if he is as concerned with poverty as he claims.  He could take action on issues of poverty which are within his remit, for example, addressing a decent increase in the minimum wage, actual measures which would mean people are not in fear regarding their employment.  We do not even have sick pay for one day.  I accept that once a person goes to a doctor perhaps he or she can get the Covid illness benefit.  I commend the Government on bringing in the illness benefit early.  Other countries were slower to recognise the need to introduce it.  However, people do not have a day off to go to the doctor.  That is the problem right now.  That is how urgent this is.  If one waits two, three or four days before one can take a day off to go to the doctor, one may have been spreading the virus during that time.  This is dangerous.  Sick pay is not a gift to workers; it is not a perk, it is effectively dangerous not to have it.<br\/><br\/>I strongly commend the Labour Party on this motion.  I am pleased we are continuing the tradition.  Senator Gavan and others in the Independent Group have a strong tradition in this House of strong, good measures and co-operation on workers' rights which I hope we can continue.  It is not too late.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy English, to withdraw the amendment and perhaps consider accepting the motion.  Nothing ties his hands.  The Minister of State can decide what expediting might mean.  He can provide measures to employers and simply look to the <i>force majeure<\/i>provision in the Parental Leave Act, which is different regarding parental leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#UU00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, to the Chamber this evening.  I will be supporting the Government countermotion.  It is recognised that there is no statutory sick pay in Ireland, and we are an outlier among EU member states in this regard.  As was mentioned earlier, Ireland is one of only five countries in Europe that does not have sick pay.  We have illness benefit, which is a payment made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  In 2019 it amounted to about &euro;607 million and it is expected to amount to &euro;600 million in 2020.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact the T&aacute;naiste publicly stated his intention to establish a statutory sick pay scheme in full consultation with employers and unions.  This will build on the various improvements that have been made to social protections for workers in the past five years, including parental leave, paternity leave and the extension of social insurance benefits to the self-employed and those in the gig economy.<\/p> <p>While most businesses in the country have reopened and are trading, many are faced with the prospect of a slow recovery in domestic consumer demand and increased international demand, together with the overhang of costs and losses which arose during the global pandemic.  Micro and small businesses are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of Covid-19.  Many businesses, even while closed, continue to incur costs, including fixed costs, without being able to generate revenues.  This proposal puts all the cost burden on businesses, which would result in jobs being lost.<\/p> <p>Although the introduction of the SSP scheme for short-term illnesses makes sense on some fronts, employees would be paid from the first day of illness, which is particularly important for low-paid employees who do currently do not have paid sick leave.  It would also bring Ireland in line with the provisions of other EU member states.  The lack of statutory sick pay in Ireland has been criticised for many years but has come to the fore during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The lack of a statutory sick pay scheme has been touted as a contributing factor in the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace, as employees are likely to turn up for work with symptoms to avoid loss of pay.  The example of meat factories has been used in the debate.  I know of a number of factories in Tipperary where that has been the case and people have gone to work due to being concerned about not getting paid.<\/p> <p>A number of issues need to be ironed out.  Additional costs would arise for employers through higher payroll costs which would place a significant burden on them at a time when they are struggling with the impact of Covid-19.  While larger employers already have sick pay schemes in place, the additional administration and compliance costs for those firms that did not already operate a sick pay scheme would drive micro and small firms out of business.  There is a possibility that employees with children would receive lower SSP payments compared with the illness benefit payments that they would receive.  If we can introduce statutory sick pay it must be balanced with the need to support the viability of businesses and the enterprise sector, thereby protecting jobs and getting people back to work as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>I wish to respond to the point Senator Gavan made about Sinn F&eacute;in's contribution on sick pay in recent years.  When this was discussed in 2012 and 2013 one of his colleagues, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, said at the time that introducing sick pay would bring the burden onto employers with no regard for their ability to pay and that on the back of that some employers would be forced to go out of business and people would lose jobs.  What is evident tonight is that the issue must be teased out more, which is what I support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#VV00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, to the House.

It is a timely and appropriate way to bring and use that real experience he encountered with workers in the red meat sector.  I will talk about them too later on.<\/p><p>We are aware there was no statutory right to sick leave and this debate is both lively and long overdue.  I am aware it has happened in the D&aacute;il.  It is, however, important that we deal with it.  Sick pay should be, and is, about a fundamental right for all workers and yet Ireland still has no statutory sick pay policy.  As someone who is on the agricultural panel and had much contact with people in both the mushroom sector and cut flower industry, the red meat sector and various other horticulture and agriculture-related businesses and, particularly, the agricultural sector, this is a common problem.  <\/p><p>A worker said to me about two weeks ago that thousands of workers, like this person, face a stark choice to self-isolate and go destitute or drag ones ill and contagious self to work.  What a powerful and depressing statement at the same time.  I will repeat it.  Hundreds of workers are facing a stark choice, that is, self-isolate and go destitute or drag their ill and contagious selves to work.  That is what this is partly about and we simply must do something about it.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan spoke earlier about the major problem in the red meat sector.  We are aware of the knock-on effect of that and we know many people who have shared their personal experiences with regard to it.  Having little money in one's pocket, with rent and bills to pay and one's family to support, is why many of these people are forced to conceal illness and drag themselves to the workplace to be able to bring back some sort of earnings to their house.  That is important.<\/p><p>I support the Labour Party motion because it seeks to ensure that no worker will be out of pocket when he or she falls ill.  I ask the Minister of State to focus on the real issue.  Where is our social charter?  Where are our workers' rights?  What will we do about it?  We need to stand in solidarity and many of us here have our benefits.  Before we came into these Houses, however, we were workers too and we were subject to some of the shortcomings with regard to this matter.  We should not forget that.  We are aware of our neighbours, families and friends who are subject to similar situations and lack of supports, and of the security of having statutory sick leave.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to reconsider supporting the three asks in this motion.  As Senator Higgins suggested, perhaps he might do so after having listened to and reflected on the contributions in the debate in this House.  He might consider either reducing the time he proposes in terms of six months to, possibly, two months if it is a real priority or, better still, perhaps he will stand in solidarity with us in this House and withdraw the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#VV00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator.

I understand Senator Sherlock had a big involvement in and commitment to it and I welcome that.<\/p> <p>I certainly welcome the opportunity to have this discussion.  The T&aacute;naiste clearly said on behalf of our Department and on behalf of Government that we are committed to introducing a statutory sick pay scheme.  That is a strong commitment.  While some have gone half way to welcoming it, most choose to ignore that commitment.  It is quite a large step on behalf of this country.  It is an area we have not seen progress in for a long time and yet the T&aacute;naiste committed to it the other day.  It cannot just happen like that.  To do this right takes a little bit of time and our amendment refers to making sure we get this right and get the balance right.  That is what we are trying to achieve.<\/p> <p>Likewise, I have obviously referred to the minimum wage and progress made in that regard.  People forget to mention, however, the process behind that, namely, the Low Pay Commission which was introduced by Governments put in place a system to get there.  Much progress has been made and, again, any Government with Fine Gael in it has honoured the commitment to the Low Pay Commission and taken on board its recommendations regardless of how high they might be or how low they are.  It has taken on board the recommendations and implemented them.  That process is working but, again, recognises the timing and balance of when one makes these changes.  The Low Pay Commission did not bring proposals forward in July because it recognised the timing.  It brought them forward in September and the Government adopted them.  It is about doing things right and in a process that recognises it is difficult for some sectors.  One must give time and space to be able to achieve success in many areas.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Government are committed to it and that is what is important.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to address these important issues again here and I thank the Labour Party for the motion.  Covid-19 continues to have significant impacts on all workers and, particularly, working parents and their children.  I am aware many families experience significant stress due to the unavailability of family support and in situations where a child&rsquo;s school or childcare provider is closed because a child or children have tested positive for the virus.  We are extremely sympathetic to these families and acknowledge the challenge working parents and employees face, and will likely face, in the months ahead as we learn and continue to learn to live and work with Covid-19 restrictions.<\/p> <p>There was some commentary during this debate, but also outside this House, on illness benefit and supports for people who are out of work.  It was not always informed commentary and I will put on record exactly what the situation is.  The previous Government acted quickly once Covid-19 emerged.  Since March, all workers certified by a doctor as diagnosed with or suspected of having Covid-19, or who are awaiting a test result or isolating because of a close contact with Covid-19, are immediately entitled to the Covid-19 enhanced illness benefit, which is &euro;350 for up to ten weeks.  We recognise it is not the full wage and it is not 90% of wages.  It is, however, a fairly strong commitment on behalf of the taxpayer to introduce that illness benefit of &euro;350.  This was an important intervention given the lack of a statutory pay scheme in Ireland and it recognises that fact.  To date, more than 60,000 people have availed of it.  The goal is to support people to not go to work when they present with Covid-19 symptoms by protecting their income as much as we possibly can and addressing their financial concerns when they should be in isolation.  <\/p> <p>Normally, a person is not entitled to illness benefit for the first six days of any period of incapacity for work.  These days are known generally as waiting days.  Significantly, where a person is diagnosed with Covid-19, or is a probable source of Covid-19, he or she will not be subject to the usual six waiting days provision.  Therefore, the payment from the first day of illness allows them to comply with medical advice to self-isolate to mitigate the spread of the disease while having their income protected.  The rate of the enhanced illness benefit payment for Covid-19 is up to &euro;350 per week.  This is higher than the normal maximum personal rate of standard illness benefit for a limited period out to April 2021.<\/p> <p>Additional allowances on top of the personal rate in respect of dependant adults and children continue at the normal payment level and other supports that come with that.  Payment will be made where an employee or self-employed person is diagnosed with Covid-19 or is a probable source of infection.  Payment can be made for a period of up to ten weeks for those diagnosed with Covid-19 subject to ongoing certification.  Most people do not require payment for this duration and have not to date.<\/p> <p>Payment can be made for a period of two weeks for those who are certified to be a probable source of infection.  It is important that employees and the self-employed comply with public health advice to self-isolate, where appropriate, while having their income protected to the greatest extent possible.  There is much effort to get that message across.  It was important we correct that because misinformation does not help the public health message we are trying to get out there.  It is essential if we are to limit and slow down the spread of the virus that we keep the number of people affected to a minimum and reduce the peak of cases which will cause extreme pressure on the health system.  <\/p> <p>The contribution conditions have been changed so the maximum number of employees are covered, including those in seasonal, part-time or casual employment.  There was no charge by GPs for certificates of incapacity for work.  The standard consultation fee is paid for by the person who is ill or it was covered by the medical card.  It is important that self-employed people who do not normally qualify for illness benefit are also eligible for the enhanced illness benefit in these limited circumstances.  <\/p> <p>The changed rates of payment will only apply to people who claim illness benefit with regard to Covid-19.  This is an easy-to-access support provided by the Government in these special circumstances which provides income support for employees who do not get paid by their employer while on sick leave.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Many employees have worked with the system and with their employees to get this balance right.  In some cases this does not happen but the majority of employers have acted responsibly and we should recognise that in this House.  It is fine to call out those who might not have but we should recognise that the majority have, according to the feedback we are getting as Deputies and Ministers and I am sure Senators will encounter the same feedback.<br\/><br\/>As of 2 October, more than &euro;38.7 million has been spent on the enhanced illness benefit payment.  It is reaching those who need it, in most cases.<br\/><br\/>On parental leave and the issue around <i>force majeure<\/i>, this Member's motion calls for an extension of the <i>force majeure<\/i>parental leave where a child's school or childcare provider is closed due to Covid-19.  The House will be aware that form of leave is paid leave provided for under the Parental Leave Act 1988 and Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2006.  It is under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Helen McEntee, and she addressed this in the previous discussion in this House in relation to the Bill put forward.  It is intended to provide for short periods of leave in urgent family situations where a close family members is ill or has been injured.  The maximum amount of leave allowable is three days in any 12-month period or five days in a 36-month period.  It is important to acknowledge that it is probable that if an employee suspects their child has Covid-19, the employer may not want that employee to attend the workplace until clarity has been brought.  That aside, there are a number of issues with the proposal which will need to be considered further and there is a commitment to do that in the wider debate.  <i>Force majeure<\/i>leave applies in emergency situations where an employee must deal with an urgent family crisis.  The proposed change would place it on a more long-term footing, similar to other family leaves but without the necessity for a notice period.  That would need to be looked at and that has been addressed before.<br\/><br\/>The shadow motion possibly places a significant burden on employers, which the Supreme Court previously found must be proportionate at a time when many employers, particularly SMEs, are struggling to remain viable.  The Bill does not take account of possible working from home arrangements that may be in place and this would need to be looked at further.  Many employers have been accommodating employees as best they can.<br\/><br\/>The reference I made to the viability of SMEs is also relevant to the last part of our countermotion, looking at all ways to achieve what we want.  We are committed to the statutory sick pay scheme, as the T&aacute;naiste has said, but we have to look at the burden this will bring to many employers, including small employers who may not be able to cope with that.  I accept that is referenced in the motion but we have to go into it in great detail to get the balance correct.<br\/><br\/>On the introduction of statutory sick pay, the T&aacute;naiste has publicly stated his intention to establish a statutory sick pay scheme in full consultation with employers and unions.  That is the best way to do it.  It is not to kick it off for six, 12 or 18 months for no reason; it is to give us time to get this detail worked out and to introduce a scheme that will work and stand the test of time.  This will build on the various improvements made to social protection for workers over the past five years.  Some claim the Government should be judged on actions and our actions are clear when it comes to improvement of parental leave and parental benefit, swift action on Covid, commitments to sick pay and the Low Pay Commission and increases to the minimum wage.  We are strongly committed to that and the programme for Government shows our intent to deliver more in this area and that is what we should be judged on.  When we say we will do something and need more time to do it, I ask people to accept that and accept that the Government has delivered in the past.<br\/><br\/>The statutory sick pay scheme would improve workers&rsquo; rights, particularly low-paid workers, but there are various issues to consider.  In that regard, the T&aacute;naiste presented a draft issue paper on statutory sick pay to the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, the subgroup on employment legislation, last Wednesday, 30 September, with a view to commencing a consultation process.  That is not kicking the can down the road; that is action that will result in progress.  That is what we are talking about and what we asked for in the discussion in the other House on the Bill and in tonight&rsquo;s motion as well.  The T&aacute;naiste requested that the social partners consider the range of issues and policy options set out in the paper and submit their views on the paper by 14 October, next Wednesday.  We are not kicking the can down the road for 18 months or beyond; it is next week.  Representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC, Chambers Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation attended that meeting.  The views of the social partners will be taken on board and the revised paper will then be discussed at a further meeting of LEEF later this month.  It will then be presented to the plenary LEEF for an agreement in advance of launching a full public consultation in November this year, not six, 12 or 18 months but very soon because we are committed to doing this and let there be no doubt on that.  The Seanad calls on the Government to expedite the consultation process but consultation is crucial and has proven beneficial in the past.  When we make large steps in the right direction, it is important we do them in the right way and bring everybody with us.  That is what we are trying to do.  As I said in my contribution in the other House on this Bill, we cannot come in and do it just like that.  It does not work that way in the real world because it is a big commitment and a big draw on resources.  We have to get it right and that is what we want to do.  Any move to introduce a new scheme that will impose further costs on business must be carefully considered and worked out.<br\/><br\/>While most businesses in the country have reopened and are trading, many are still faced with the prospect of a slow recovery in domestic consumer demand and decreased international demand, together with the overhang of costs and losses which arose during recent months.  As my colleagues have already said, many businesses could have taken the easy option at the start of all this and just forgot about it, closed and locked up their business.  However, they did not.  They tried to find a way to keep their doors open and their staff employed.  I sit down on a daily basis with all the different sectors and ask them what is in their head and what they really think.  It always comes back to keeping their staff employed for most of them and keeping the service they have established.  Number one, from conversations with most of those people, is about their staff.  The biggest thank you they have for the taxpayer for all the supports was for the wage subsidy scheme because it meant they could keep their staff there and keep the link to work.  They recognise other supports that were brought in by the Government on behalf of the taxpayer.  They recognise the taxpayer has put a lot of money into supporting them and their business but the biggest thank you was for the wage subsidy.  Employers in the majority are absolutely committed to their employees and I do not like the way this House tries to give the impression on many occasions that they are not.  It is a lot of effort to employ somebody and even the raise in the minimum wage &ndash; nobody is arguing against somebody on the minimum wage earning more money &ndash; can bring extra costs straight away.  Consider a small shop employing 20 people, there is an extra couple of thousand euro per year just like that when the minimum wage increases.  That, in most cases, cannot be passed on but businesses and employers recognise that is a positive direction for people and they want to see their staff getting more money.  However, it does not come easy and we have to recognise that in all these conversations.  It takes a bit of working out and sometimes it means, as was referenced by Senator Marie Sherlock today, that the taxpayer might have to step in for some smaller companies to make this happen.  We recognise that and that is what we try to do.  The Labour motion reflects that we do not assume every employer can absorb all these costs, when it comes to pay, statutory sick pay and so on.<br\/><br\/>Microbusinesses and small businesses are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of Covid-19.  Many businesses, even while closed, continue to incur costs, including fixed costs, without being able to generate revenue.  We hear reference to that with people who own hotels having to pay thousands of euro in ESB bills while no customers come in.  We have to get the timing of all this right without adding additional pressure on those who cannot carry any more.  I have had discussions with everybody in this House about the necessity for us to be honest with small businesses and all employers that there will be a combination of state supports, more equity put in and probably the necessity to borrow along the way, as well.  The Houses of the Oireachtas and the taxpayer will not be able to cover every issue facing small companies and employers but we will work with them across the system, including the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme.  Any move to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme must be balanced with the need to support the viability of the business and enterprise sector, thereby protecting jobs and the desire to get people back to work as quickly as possible in all sectors, including hospitality, childcare and many others.  The Government has committed unprecedented levels of financial supports using taxpayers' money to keep businesses afloat including liquidity supports<br\/><br\/>;the restart grant; the credit guarantee scheme; the rate waivers from local authorities; the warehousing of tax liabilities for SMEs by Revenue; and the different wage subsidy schemes we have had.  As I emphasised in the D&aacute;il in September, businesses continue to require help to stabilise, reboot, deal with the challenges they will face coming into winter and make the decision to reopen easier.  Sometimes their accountant will tell them they should close the door but they say: &ldquo;No.  We want to open.  We want to stay open.&rdquo;  We need them to stay open and create jobs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> To wrap up, I will set out the issues that will be examined.  First, additional costs that will arise for employers through higher payroll costs have to be looked at.  This will place a significant burden on employers at a time when they are struggling with the impact of Covid-19.  Second, we must look at the associated increase in administration and compliance costs for micro SMEs, especially for those firms which do not already operate a sick pay scheme.  While we recognise that many still do, but some do not, and that is why we are having this discussion.  We cannot further risk those jobs.  The motion is trying to protect jobs, create jobs and make them better jobs.  Third, there will be additional costs for firms or industries with a higher incidence of absenteeism.  We have to work through that and factor through that as well.  We can see it in all sectors.  Another point to consider is that statutory sick pay is a break from the voluntary terms and conditions that many employers afford their employees in contracts of employment.  That also needs to be looked at.  The discussion around collective bargaining was also referenced here today.  We did strengthen legislation on this in 2015, through our colleague from the House, and we are committed in the programme for Government to looking at other areas of legislation on collective bargaining.<\/p><p>All that is impacted by a commitment to implement a statutory sick pay scheme, so it is not just as simple as saying we should do it next week or the week after.  It takes a little bit of time.  We are committed to coming back to the House with a general scheme of a Bill by March 2021.  That is what the T&aacute;naiste has said, and the work has begun, and the subgroup met last week and will report again next week.  We will build on that and we will be back here before March with movement in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#WW00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I will be sharing my time with Senator Hoey, and for clarification, Senator Sherlock will wrap up the debate on behalf of the Labour Party.<\/p> <p>I thank my colleague, Senator Sherlock, for all the work she has put into this, in particular on leading the agenda on sick pay.  Senator Sherlock has been a leading trade unionist in this country, and neither she nor the Labour Party has come late to the issue of workers' rights.  I note, with some irony, a Fine Gael representative referring back to our manifesto on it, as if making out that we have just discovered that this is an issue here today.  However, there is a particular urgency, and this is why I am going to argue against the amendment to the motion to extend it for six months.<\/p> <p>Covid has exposed many fault lines and inequalities, but a lack of sick pay has been the one that has caused the most hindrance for our ability to fight this virus.  Many healthcare professionals who we depend on to care for older and vulnerable people in the community or in nursing homes receive no sick pay from their employers.  I have spoken to healthcare workers who tell me that the cleaners and porters in their HSE building do not get any sick pay because they work for an agency.  People who work in this building, who come and service us, also do not get sick pay because they are working for an agency.  There are an awful lot of State services, not just microbusinesses, that we pay for and provide, that do not provide sick pay for their workers.  When the Minister of State talks about microbusinesses and enterprise, he should remember that there are real incidences that can be written into contracts, that can be controlled, and that can be made part of procurement so that the agencies are forced to pay sick pay, but we do not do that.<\/p> <p>Agency workers in care and nursing homes do not get sick pay.  The vast majority of workers in low-paid or precarious work are not entitled to sick pay.  These are our front-line workers.  These are the people whose incomes we need to protect and who are doing the heavy lifting during this crisis.  These are the people whom we clapped for, whom we tweet platitudes at, and who the Minister of State is saying need to wait six months to get this done.  For these workers now, with growing numbers in the middle of a pandemic, it is not acceptable to say to wait for six months.  We had an urgency back in March when it came to addressing this virus.  We are introducing this motion on sick pay in the context of a global pandemic and rising case numbers, and when so many workers who are working in affected industries have to go to work tomorrow.<\/p> <p>For these workers, in the middle of this pandemic, there is also a housing crisis.  Does the Minister of State think that somebody who is reduced to hot-bedding because they cannot afford a room will be able to afford to go without pay and not go into work tomorrow?  The failure of the Government to provide for sick pay during the pandemic while ending the eviction ban and rent freeze effectively guarantees that people will lose their homes if they do not go to work.<\/p> <p>Workers should never be expected to choose between their wages and their health.  The lack of sick pay, combined with the housing crisis, now means that many low-paid, young or migrant workers are now living in overcrowded private rental accommodation and forced to go to work every day because they simply cannot afford not to.  Some people might refer to this as house parties that young people are having when in fact it is just younger people living in bad accommodation that is not suitable for them.<\/p> <p>Many of these people are in unregistered tenancies, falling outside the remit of an under-resourced Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, who have no protection against slum landlords who will kick them out the minute they fall behind in the payment of rent.  At the very start of this pandemic, Threshold noted that there would be many people who would be sick who would be left unable to pay their rent because of the shortfall.  There has been no indication from this Government that a blanket nationwide eviction ban will be reintroduced, despite the fact that the whole country had moved to level 3 and there are restrictions on travel.<\/p> <p>We are all in this together as long as a person is living in a home that he or she owns, with room for a home office in which that person can work from home, and he or she does not need to avail of sick pay.  Working from home is pushing the responsibility for providing work infrastructure onto the worker.  When it comes to workers' rights, why is the argument that we hear always about the burden that the legal right to sick pay would impose on some employers without acknowledging now the severe burden being placed on employees who are simply trying to follow the public health advice to stay safe and stay in their own homes if they are displaying symptoms?  We have heard the same arguments time and again regarding basic entitlements for workers.  It was a huge burden to pay women going on maternity leave, to pay workers double their time for Sundays and bank holidays, and to provide reasonable accommodation for workers.  It was still the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>When I have a look at this motion and listen to the Fine Gael speakers in the House,  I hear all the emphasis being placed not on the workers who are going to work in the middle of a pandemic but on what they are saying are small or microbusinesses, and on consideration of the practical issues and consequences that may arise, such as increased business costs and viability as a result of the proposals.  There will not be many restaurants that do not pay workers sick pay that will stay open if a worker goes into work sick and manages to infect everybody.  There will not be many places that will stay open if they are linked with an outbreak.  This is being done in the context of a global pandemic.  It is the right thing to do for the long term, but it is particularly the right thing to do with a sense of urgency.<\/p> <p>I urge the Government not to amend this motion, not to delay the introduction of statutory sick pay, and use the urgency it showed in March to introduce statutory sick pay again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#YY00300","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I am glad we are discussing this motion here again, as it gives us in the Labour Party another chance to implore the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il, and Fine Gael to reconsider the Government decision to kick the issue of sick pay down the line.<\/p> <p>As my colleague, Senator Higgins, said, the amendment includes the line, \"an alternative to sick pay\", which I think is a laudable thing to put in, but unless the alternative is actually to eradicate illness altogether, which is a bold thought in the Covid crisis, I cannot really fathom what the alternative is going to be.  Either we are on board with the national sick pay regime or we are not.  Also, the Minister of State said that the Government needs more time and has asked for us to accept that.  Actually, no, I do not accept it.  I do not accept it on behalf of workers, and I am sure many workers do not accept that there needs to be more time to figure out how to deal with sick pay.<\/p> <p>In my short time in this House, I have been called upon to vote on more than one piece of so-called emergency legislation, but, sadly, not a provision for sick pay.  I find it absolutely baffling that this Government can call as an emergency a shortage of pallets or any of the other things that we discussed and for which, we were told, we had to speed through legislation in a matter of hours, but yet ensuring sick pay for workers during a global health pandemic is not an emergency and can be looked at again in six months.  There is also reference to a public consultation, and I am sure that there are Senators, on this side of the House especially, for whom public consultation, given the palaver with the forestry Bill, sends a bit of a shiver down their spines.  Will we even get to see this public consultation?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What will be included in the public consultation?  We did not get to see that during our consideration of the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020.  I certainly hope that the standard of public consultation for that Bill will be not be the standard that applies this time.<br\/><br\/>It is astonishing that there are Members on the Government side listing the benefits of sick pay for all and murmuring support for it while at the same time kicking it down the road for six months.  We are debating the radical idea that, in 2020, during a global pandemic, workers should not lose wages because of illness.  I am thinking about the many thousands of lecturers, teachers and tutors in our higher and further education sector.  Since the beginning of the crisis, they have moved from online work to the campus and from blended work to online work again.  They have been sent back and forth, up and down and all around, usually with no more notice than a few days.  They will spend this autumn and winter going above and beyond what is required to deliver for as many students as they can.  At this time, we are asking workers to blur the line between work and home more than ever.  Workers' right to sick leave and to time away from their work in their own home for the sake of their own health is imperative.  There are very few certainties in life at present but there is absolutely no room for ambiguity regarding the importance of people&rsquo;s health.  When one is working from home - again, I am thinking about the lecturers and staff working in higher education - there is no friendly colleague or understanding manager who would normally send one home when one is clearly ill.  Instead, workers fear losing a day's pay.  As lecturers and teachers work from their own houses, without the security of guaranteed sick pay, they are more likely than ever to work through illness.  If this pandemic has taught us anything, surely it has to be that our health is our wealth.  No workers should have to choose between their well-being and their livelihood.<br\/><br\/>The language used by the Government indicates there is a &quot;commitment&quot; to addressing this matter in a couple of months.  Sick pay is not an engagement ring.  This is not about making a commitment to workers; they need sick pay now.  There are people watching this debate and contacting Labour Party representatives saying they need this now.  They do not want a commitment down the line; they need it now.<br\/><br\/>I reiterate our plea to Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party to support this motion and withdraw their amendment.  Workers do not want to watch their representatives in these parties standing up to list off all the benefits of sick pay and then having the gall to vote against this motion.  Either the Government is about creating a social floor below which workers cannot fall or it is not.  It either supports parents, through the Labour Party's <i>force majeure<\/i>legislation to allow parents to be able to take care of a sick child, or it does not.  Quite frankly, it either supports workers or it does not.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment indicates to workers that it does not support them right now.  In a global pandemic, this is a nonsense.  When the Government says it needs more time, I do not accept it.  We were told there was so much other legislation to be rushed through this House.  We were moving like maniacs trying to pass it.  We were flying through legislation.  I have never moved so fast in my life.  That was an emergency and this is an emergency.  That there is no sick pay for workers during a global pandemic is an emergency.  I do not accept the argument that the Government needs more time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#YY00400","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I support the principle of the motion.  It is vital that we review the illness supports available to workers at this point and work towards a sustainable sick pay regime for all workers.  It is important that there be consultation with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the unions and those representing the employers.  That would be prudent.  For that reason, I will be supporting the amendment.<\/p> <p>It is remarkable that Ireland is one of only five countries in the European Union in which employees have no statutory right to be paid by their employer if they are absent from work due to illness.  There is generally no legal right to be paid while on sick leave from work in this country.  During the pandemic, employers do not have to pay workers who are sick with Covid unless it is part of a contract of employment.  This needs to change, particularly because workers in certain sectors may choose to go to work if they are unpaid when sick with Covid.  Dr. Ronan Glynn effectively said the introduction of sick pay and the pandemic unemployment payment was important in helping to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  His recommendation was that the Government consider sick pay.<\/p> <p>Meat packers have low levels of access to sick pay.  There have been high rates of Covid among them.  Those working in the childcare sector have low pay.  Secretaries in schools have low pay and do not have good conditions or benefits.  All these workers must not feel pressurised to attend work while sick.<\/p> <p>We must acknowledge the disproportionate burden that falls on mothers when it comes to caring for children while ill or restricting movement.  In so many families in Kildare and the rest of the country, both parents have to work, and a sick child create serious problems in the household.  Grandparents would traditionally have stepped in to help but many such grandparents are now cocooning or are understandably unwilling to take a chance on exposing themselves to the virus.  Therefore, parents are out of options on childcare and many must rely on taking annual leave to stay at home with a sick child.<\/p> <p>I am aware of the need to be mindful of not imposing additional burdens on businesses struggling to keep the lights on right now.  Business owners in the events industry and in the hospitality, tourism and transport sectors are just some of those struggling to survive.  They could not take on any extra costs at present.  The current regime for sick pay was not designed for the current pandemic, nor was the parental leave system.  Therefore, we must be keenly aware of the circumstances of the workers and of the need to improve their rights and conditions.  We must also think about workers, such as those in Debenhams, who cannot go out sick because they do not have a job to go out sick from.  Debenhams has treated its workers really badly.  I look forward to the measures the Government will introduce to ensure such circumstances will not arise again.<\/p> <p>Access to sick pay is really important so I am glad to hear the Government is working towards a sustainable sick pay regime.  The consultation that has been mooted is important.  It is important that it happens as soon as possible so we can adopt a system that is fair to everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators who contributed on our motion, particularly those who so eloquently indicated their support for it.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell used the phrase \"lip service\" regarding the issue of sick pay for workers.  It is extraordinary that Government Senators and a Minister of State would come into this House to express support for the introduction of paid sick leave and in the same breath indicate support for an amendment to the motion.  Let us call a spade a spade: there is no word of commitment to the introduction of paid sick leave in the counter-motion.  It refers to consideration of reforms, research into the extent of the problem, consideration of the practical issues, and, as Senator Higgins highlighted, consideration of other options for change that might be available that would not make it more difficult for employers to remain viable.  That is really what the Government is talking about, rather than supporting those in need of paid sick leave.<\/p> <p>As a new Senator in this House, I know that my word is as good as the words of the Labour Party motion.  My word is reflected in the motion and the Government's word is reflected in the counter-motion, which offers no support.  It is laughable that the Government welcomes the recent introduction of the parent's benefit scheme and extended parental leave rights, as if these could be of any help to parents who find they have to isolate at home with their children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A person must give an employer six week's notice in writing if he or she wants to apply for unpaid parental leave.  For paid parental leave that is up to a period of 12 months - two weeks in a 12-month period.  As such it is ridiculous to suggest that is of any relevance or use to parents whose children have to stay home from school or childcare in the context of the pandemic.  A number of Senators have referred in this House to the actual asks within our motion.  There are three.  First, to expedite the consultation with trade unions and businesses to introduce the statutory right.  Second, to provide for a series of targeted and easy-to-access supports to employers because we recognise that there needs to be supports for employers.Third, we are asking for the extension of <i>force majeure<\/i>leave as an extraordinary and temporary measure.<br\/><br\/>My politics, and those of the Labour Party, are not about grandstanding or making fine speeches.  They are about trying to make real and practical progress for the workers who need that support.  What we have here, however, is Government Senators coming into this House and ignoring what the precise asks in our motion are.  It is not about bringing the Bill that was before the D&aacute;il into this House.  I have chosen not to do that because I want to bring the matter forward, to get the support of the whole House so that this Chamber can say to Members of the Lower House that we want them to get their act together and move quickly on introducing paid sick leave.  That would be a reflection of all the nice words that have been said today about introducing that leave.  Therefore, the Minister of State and Government Senators in particular now have a choice to withdraw their amendment and support our three simple asks which will not change the world but will send an important signal that the Government is onboard with trying to expedite the process.  It would send an important message that the Government wants to help workers who need it, workers who are, in the main, in low-paid insecure employment and who do not have access to paid sick leave.  Otherwise, the Minister of State and Government Senators are just talking out of both sides of their mouths.  It is a shameful hypocrisy to say that on the one hand one wants paid sick leave and to see it introduced but on the other hand to support the amendment.  It is, therefore, in the hands of the Government Members.  Workers in this country have listened to platitudes for six months now about the need to support workers, in particular when workers are ill and have access only to an income which is way below what they need, particularly if they are struggling to make ends meet.  I strongly urge Government Senators to withdraw their amendment or else we will really know what their true intentions are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1602063000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 25; N\u00edl, 14.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Robbie Gallagher and Se\u00e1n Kyne; N\u00edl, Senators Ivana Bacik and Marie Sherlock.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#AAA00300","aye":["1629","1633","1637","1638","1639","1641","1644","1646","1648","1651","1652","1654","1655","1658","1665","1666","1667","1670","1671","1689","1692","1693","1682","1685","1687"],"nay":["1631","1634","1635","1645","1660","1662","1663","1664","1668","1672","1688","1683","1684","1686"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602063000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Motion, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602063000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>In accordance with the order agreed today, the Seanad stands adjourned until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 October 2020 in the Seanad Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020100700002#BBB00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602063000,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 7.09 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 October 2020.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
