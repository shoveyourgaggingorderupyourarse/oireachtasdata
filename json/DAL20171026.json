Much work has been undertaken to get the Ireland 2040 document to the stage of being on display for its final round of public consultation.<\/p><p>The national planning framework is primarily intended to plan properly for what will be one of the fastest growing economies in Europe over the next couple of decades, focusing development on existing villages, towns and cities and realising the potential of our regions and our rural areas.  We now have the opportunity to plan and manage the sustainable growth and development of our country over the next 20 years or so.  That is very challenging.  We are not starting from scratch given that we have an already developed country, with five main cities, and a developed network of transport infrastructure.  We have great history and heritage in our built environment that must be protected and we have to be conscious of climate mitigation targets and putting sustainability at the forefront of all of our endeavours as we grow.<\/p><p>By 2040 there will be at least an extra 1 million people living in the Republic, taking the population to 5.75 million, approximately a 20% increase on the current population.  The all-island population will be roughly 8 million people, and there will be an extra 600,000 jobs, mainly in the knowledge economy and in services.  We will need 500,000 new homes for all of these people.  The population aged over 65 will double to 1.3 million people or almost 25% of the total population.  Those aged under 15 will fall to under 1 million people.<\/p><p>It is not possible to know what the political and economic challenges might be for all those people living and working here in 2040, but there are political and economic challenges that we have to be aware of now as we plan.  Brexit is the most obvious one, but there is also the question of how the future of the European Union might evolve and challenge us.  The current retreat from globalisation and free trade being pursued by certain countries might impact on matters such as foreign direct investment.  Technology will bring changes in how we work and where we live, with remote working, the shared economy, drone technology, automation and artificial intelligence.  We must protect communities as we grow and regenerate parts of our country where we can.  As recent events remind us, our climate is changing and we need to take the immediate steps to adapt to those changes and put in train changes to address the drivers of climate change by de-carbonising our way of life and taking advantage of the many opportunities that come from that.<\/p><p>If we continue to grow as we have been, if the <i>status quo<\/i>continues, depleting our communities and our regions, sprawling away from our urban cores, our cities will choke off, in particular our economic engine in Dublin, and the country will die.  People might question this notion.  They might say that things, relatively speaking, putting to one side the crisis of homelessness and the shortage of housing, are not so bad.  We are in the top ten when it comes to human development, gross domestic product, GDP <i>per capita<\/i>, foreign direct investment, FDI, and democracy.  However, we fall into the top 20 when it comes to quality of life and environmental performance, and into the top 30 in Dublin when we talk about liveable cities.<\/p><p>Our national planning framework has to have a vision that will navigate us through these challenges, both the existing ones we know of such as protecting the environment, and the challenges that may come due to developments external to us.  We have had spatial strategies before and they have failed.  This vision will be different because it will be aligned across Departments to ensure coherence between what the framework envisions and what others are planning, be it in respect of schools, hospitals or roads.  The finalisation of Ireland 2040 as a draft in September was driven by the Government's decision to align the forthcoming ten-year national investment plan, NIP, with the national planning framework, avoiding past mistakes where decisions on where to spend scarce public capital investment were made before the national spatial strategy was finalised.  We are putting our money where our mouth is.  Our capital investment will underpin our planning framework so that these plans are real.  The national framework will be the bedrock or foundation of all other development plans.  It will be completed this year.  Next year our three regions will be tasked with coming up with more specific regional spatial and economic strategies based on the framework and in more detail, with city and county plans based on that, and local area plans on them.  This will be the new hierarchy and it will be set in law.  Finally, there will be a smart growth fund put in place centrally to enable regions to target growth and development for key areas by competing for additional funding, based on the merit of the project and as long as it is in line with the ten-year NIP and the NPF.<\/p><p>One of the core principles at the heart of the NPF is to concentrate growth in the core of our population centres, to focus development on existing villages, towns, urban centres and cities, to stop sprawling inefficiently outwards, and to focus on higher density and on infill development.  This is particularly important within our cities.<\/p><p>As the economy continues its recovery, and as we build more houses and improve the lives of people locked out of the housing market or trapped in emergency accommodation, a key challenge for all of us will be to meet the expectations of people when it comes to important quality of life issues.  Turning our attention to issues such as commuting times, energy efficiency of homes, affordability and community will also make sense from an economic and efficiency point of view as we capitalise on existing and planned infrastructural investment.<\/p><p>Our cities and large towns are growing as major centres of employment but they are not growing quickly enough as places to live in.  The population of Ireland grew by 53,000 in the year to April 2017, the largest increase since 2008.  That is 1.1% year-on-year growth when the rest of the euro area was essentially static.  Half the daytime population of Ireland's three largest cities travel from outside of them.  One quarter of Leinster's working population travels into Dublin each day.  In 2016, some 230,000 people commuted at least an hour a day each way, a 30% increase in long commutes in just five years.  Think about what that means for families' quality of life.  If we learned anything from the so-called Celtic tiger era, it was that our future does not lie in our people living in one location, and commuting up to 100 km to work, juggling work and family lives and losing the battle to strike a reasonable balance.<\/p><p>With fewer than 1,000 properties available for rent in Dublin and similar low levels in all our other cities, there is not just under-supply, but a gaping hole in the supply of affordable accommodation and rental accommodation in particular in the hearts of our cities and large towns.  Turning that tide means we simply have to deliver more apartments in our cities and towns.  While we have an immediate housing crisis to face if we pause to plan, even for just a moment, we can tackle the crisis and secure the sustainable development of our country and communities into 2040 and beyond.  We must think about the impact of our actions now on the decades ahead if one crisis is not simply to roll into another.<\/p><p> We have to try to manage that growth between our five cities, as well as between our three regions.  In Dublin, that means 25% of national growth happening within Dublin.  Half of that will be inside the M50 so we will need joined up planning across the local authority areas and new land plans for important strategic land banks.  It means another 25% of our forecast growth is happening in the cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  Each of these cities will have to effectively double in population size at the very least.  It also means that 50% of the population growth will happen everywhere else.  Approximately 15% of the growth will take place in the fabric of our towns, villages and rural areas and there are opportunities coming for this from changes in technology, job types and the ways in which we will live and work in the future.  Another way to look at it is that half of the anticipated growth between now and 2040 will take place on the eastern seaboard and in the midlands, with the other half in the southern, western and northern regions.  This all has significant implications for what we build, how we build it and where we build it.  If we think of that quality of life challenge, then we have to build communities as we look to 2040.  A quarter of our population will be over the age of 65 so we have to build communities that will suit that population and will also suit people with disability or other health needs and their quality of life as we plan for the future.  We also have to plan for affordability - being able to live close to work at an affordable price so that people can live their lives in the way that they choose to.<\/p> <p> Work on this framework has been ongoing since the end of 2014.  Engagement with the relevant stakeholders, the general public and other governance agencies and bodies has been central to the formulation of the draft.  Road shows have been undertaken, initial public consultations carried out and an expert advisory group established, and over 700 submissions received from a whole range of stakeholders.  Now, as part of this draft consultation on Ireland 2040, submissions are being accepted up to 3 November and a series of regional briefings have already commenced with each of the three regional assemblies.  After the period for submissions ends, it is my intention to have a finalised version of Ireland 2040 for the consideration and approval of the Government by December.  This will take place in co-ordination with the finalisation of the ten-year national investment plan, again underlining a very important pillar of this new national planning framework.  Returning again to how this differs from spatial strategies of the past, we will be aligning our planning for the future with our investment plans and this will be the bedrock for all future planning coming down the line, be it in the regional spatial economic strategies that will be designed and developed next year, or in the county and city that will flow from them.  There will also be alignment across Departments and Government investment to make sure that there is co-ordinated thinking and planning as we grow into the future.  We will grow as a country and we will grow in every part of the country.  There needs to be joined up thinking in promoting that growth so that we can have better and more efficient towns, villages and communities for our population in 2040 and beyond.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600003#A00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509009000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The national planning framework builds on the historic and internationally significant national spatial strategy that Fine Gael scrapped under their short-term approach in 2012.  Now, accompanied by a new flashy website and jargon-driven Government spin, the national planning framework is being launched with more ministerial photos and introductory paragraphs than I can remember reading in a Government publication.  I will try now to see through the management speak, however, and give an outline as to why, although I welcome the change in Fine GaeI&rsquo;s attitude to national planning, I have reservations that this framework is essentially a plan about plans.<\/p><p>The national planning framework as currently constructed is deeply flawed and indeed reflective of the Government's centralising instinct that is counter-productive in achieving balanced regional development and in ensuring that all of our people are consulted and involved in this plan from draft to publication to implementation to monitoring and then to review.  What should be our plan should not be turned into Leo&rsquo;s plan or Fine Gael's plan.  The principle behind this planning framework should be the centrality of all of our people contributing to the plan.  Instead we have an &ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s a winner&rdquo; mantra which is vague and full of mum and apple pie aspirations that could, if left unaddressed, further erode the confidence of the public in the political system to address difficult issues with honesty, inclusivity and courage.<\/p><p>  To anyone reading this draft plan in full, as I have, the Ireland of 2040 will be something approaching heaven.  All of our developmental, planning and infrastructural problems will apparently be magically resolved without any specifics, timelines or any budgets.  We need to get real here.  This plan needs to be honest.  As it currently stands, it has more in common with the utopian manifestoes of Trump and Tory-style politics.  This constant spin is doing so much damage to politics.  A national planning framework can be credible and ambitious.  The spatial strategy it succeeds was an honest start.  This plan seems to me to be more about the next election cycle then about the next 23 years.  The new aligned capital plan which is being shrouded in secrecy is the reality of what the Government means behind the cotton candy of this draft plan.  The people and the media should not be dazzled by the draft national planning framework but should rightly analyse how the capital plan, both in its formulation and its contents, aligns with the framework.  No one outside Government, however, has seen the detail of the aligned capital plan or has been consulted about it, proving that we have cause for concern about the sincerity of the spin.  If there is no sincere and robust consultation by Members of the D&aacute;il In the new capital plan, then how can our regional and local authorities and the wider public have any faith that their views will be listened to?<\/p><p>  Unless all our people are consulted about the capital plan and can see within it the projects that are needed, this national planning framework is just a smoke screen for continued centralised governance and urban sprawl on the east coast while rural Ireland and our regional towns and villages continue to decline and disappear.  A key requirement for this plan to be credible is the need to spell out specific infrastructural needs and intentions.  If we are to achieve an adequate transport system In the greater Dublin region, including commuter counties such as Wicklow, we need key commitments and projects to be spelled out here.  I will refer to my own county of Wicklow as an example of how key capital plan and planning framework needs are being ignored with ambiguous promises and no concrete proposals or workable timelines.  There is no mention in this planning framework of the need for a substantial upgrade of N11-M11, a key feeder road into Dublin that is currently gridlocked every day of the week.  There is no mention in this planning framework of the Luas extension to Bray which would provide major relief to our transport chaos and help balance development with regard to the Dublin metropolitan region.  There is no mention of the improvements to the existing rail and DART network to tackle the sardines in a can experience to which rail users from Wicklow town and Arklow can testify.  There is no mention of port towns such as Arklow and Wicklow, only  vague ideas around tier one and tier two port towns.  With regard to the wastewater scandal that is plaguing Arklow and so many other towns and villages, no specific tasks or projects are mentioned other than that the national issue of wastewater is now a key short-term priority.  After 25 years, I&rsquo;m sure the people of Arklow will be delighted to hear that.<\/p><p>With regard to housing, the plan states that we need over half a million more homes by 2040 but gives no concrete proposals as to how to get there.  It would almost be funny if it were not such a serious crisis.  It is in the area of one-off rural housing, however, that I have serious concerns about the hidden time bomb contained the current draft of the national planning framework.  We are all aware of the need for local people to be able to live in rural Ireland and of the difficulties that far too many rural Irish people face when they seek to build a family home in their own locality.  This plan&rsquo;s attempt to address rural housing states the intention to recognise those who have an economic interest In living in rural Ireland.  This does nothing to resolve the difficulty that many face when trying to build a family home in rural Ireland.  Has the Minister informed the people of rural Ireland what he means by  an economic need to live in the countryside?  Has he explained the definition of having a functional economic requirement for housing?  He has not explained in any of the public information sessions to date what he means by economic need because he is only too aware of its implications on the rural way of life.  If this economic need is adopted, it will be another nail in the coffin of rural Ireland, this time in the form of death by policy.<\/p><p>  Let us be honest with the people and explain to them exactly what are the implications.  I will give the House three examples.  Let us take an individual from a family that has lived in rural Wicklow for four generations.  This person gets a job in a factory about eight miles from his family home.  He no longer qualifies for one-off rural housing because he no longer has an economic need to live on his own land.  Let us imagine as a second example a farmer with three children.  One of them takes over the farm activities and qualifies to build a home because he has an economic need.<\/p><p>My other two children, however, can no longer live on the family farm because they have no economic need, they only have a social need.  My third example is that if I fly in from another country with no connections to Ireland whatsoever, but I am going to get involved in the agriculture business and do some farming, I would now qualify because I have economic need.  This cannot be based on economic need only but on social need as well.<\/p> <p> For years I have heard from Department officials and planners that the country cannot sustain rural housing in the future.  While I share some of that sentiment, the same officials and planners have yet to address it and come up with credible alternatives.  What the planners in every county excel in, however, is devising ways to refuse planning for families living in rural Ireland.  This plan, and policy objective 18b with its focus on economic need, must be changed before it is adopted.  Otherwise, within a very short period of time of this plan being adopted, that economic need will be part of the core strategy of every county development plan in the country.  This will have a devastating effect on rural Ireland.  It is already hard enough to get planning in these areas.  We need to get serious about helping people who live in rural Ireland, both in rural areas and in rural towns and villages.<\/p> <p> All of these glossy documents and all of this spin are just a smokescreen to disguise the approach of doing as little as possible which the Fine Gael and Independent Alliance Government has adopted.  We need a planning framework and a capital plan that all Irish people can have ownership of and confidence in.  We do not need a planning framework which is a smokescreen for a capital plan which serves the interests of a centralised Government in getting re-elected.  Currently the national planning framework is a placebo plan, which gives the psychological impression of treatment while containing nothing of substance.<\/p> <p> We in Fianna F&aacute;il are prepared to work with the Government to ensure that Ireland's national planning framework and our new capital plan reflect the title it has used - Ireland 2040 Our Plan.  We need all the people to have an input into the capital plan.  The public participation networks, the local action groups, elected councillors, local authorities and every public body with an interest should be involved.  If &ldquo;our plan&rdquo; is not to be regarded as fake news this needs to happen.  At the moment all I can see is the Government's plan.  I wait to see if our ideas will be taken on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600004#B00300","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509009600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>May I begin by expressing a certain degree of frustration?  We have had to adjourn the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for half an hour to give our statements in the Chamber.  While that is not the fault of anyone currently in the room, it means that those of use who are on that committee and involved in this particular debate are put in an awkward position.  We will not be able to listen to the contributions of other Members, despite the fact that we would benefit from them.  I will raise that matter with the Business Committee.  I am also disappointed that the Minister has not made the time to remain.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan but, given the huge importance of the national planning framework and of real dialogue between all the different participants in this debate, I would have expected the Minister to stay for at least the first hour of the discussion.  I know that the officials are here.  They are probably more important than the Minister in terms of capturing the detail of this, but it is still something which needs to be commented on.<\/p>  <p>  The planning framework is a hugely important document.  I welcome that the process is under way and that it is being brought through the Oireachtas and put on a statutory footing.  I have genuine concerns about the extent of local community and local authority buy-in to the process up to this point.  I know there has been a large number of meetings in local areas, however a significant number of those were poorly attended.  Some 700 submissions to a document of this importance, which covers the entire island in many respects, is not an indication of success.  It shows the level of disengagement out there.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that all of that consultation was at the pre-draft stage.  It is really when we see the draft, the document in front of us, that we get into the meat of whether this is being done in the correct way.  Yet we are only being given just over six weeks - from 26 September when the draft was published up to Friday week - to make submissions and there will be no supplementary consultation with local authorities or local communities and stakeholders during that period.  That is probably when the consultation would have been most important.  I strongly urge the Government to reconsider that approach and to consider extending the deadline, not to facilitate submissions from Members because we can complete them within the deadline, but to go back out and engage with stakeholders and communities in order to ensure the maximum level of participation.<\/p>  <p>  While intending no disrespect to the officials who are working very hard to meet the Government's deadlines, I share many of Deputy Pat Casey's concerns.  There is a lot of text surrounding the policy objectives, but that text is just context.  A lot of it is aspirational and vague.  The meat of this document is really the 69 or more policy objectives.  Across most of those, very few firm targets are given and there is very little indication of how delivery will take place.  I will go through some of those concerns.<\/p>  <p>  If one looks at policy objective 1a, according to this plan almost half of the population growth will be concentrated on the eastern and midland region.  Even though approximately half of that half, or a quarter overall, will be in Dublin, we know that the bulk of that 500,000 people will be in Dublin and the commuter belt.  That will put huge strain on the existing infrastructure in those areas.  It seems to be a scaling down of the ambition previously indicated by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to have genuinely balanced regional development.  While Dublin is only meant to be taking approximately 250,000 people, the greater Dublin and commuter belt area will probably take approximately 500,000 people, with all of the consequences that will have for Dublin, for the other cities, and for the issues around rural regeneration.<\/p>  <p>  If one looks at policy objective 2b, 50% of the growth is intended to happen in five cities.  I welcome the fact that we are no longer talking about second tier cities.  There was always a fear that there would be a battle between Cork and Limerick as to which would get priority.  It is a good thing that is not there and that a different approach is being taken.  I am not saying that the detail for each of the cities other than Dublin is right yet, but it is a more balanced approach.  Derry and Belfast, however, are not included.  We cannot seriously think about population growth and spatial planning, particularly in terms of the regeneration of the north west, if we are completely blind in that section of the document to the other two major cities on the island.  We need to be much more ambitious about creating stronger counterbalances to the growth of the Dublin and greater Dublin region.  Part of that needs to include rethinking those targets.<\/p>  <p>  I am also unsure of policy objectives 13 through to 17b in terms of halting rural decline and exactly how that is meant to transpire.  Some of those policy objectives are among the most ambiguous and vague and it is not clear how they will work out.  In respect of jobs, there is a set of targets for jobs in the regions.  I have two concerns about those targets.  First, they say nothing about the existing imbalance in the distribution of jobs within those regions.  For example, while the plan talks about several hundred thousand jobs in one region, they may all continue to go to the areas within that region which are already disproportionately served and the regional inequality in terms of distribution of jobs may be continued, as will the consequences of economic deprivation.<\/p>  <p>  On chapter 5, which is about communities, policy objective 25 involves promoting sustainable community development and supporting community development.  I laughed when I read this.  Again, I mean no disrespect to the planning officials.  This is not their fault.  We have seen the decimation of the funding and the independence of the community development sector and community based organisations.  There is no sign that any of that funding will be restored.  In fact, the infrastructure which would be used to develop that policy objective is increasingly not there.  Again, that is not necessarily an issue for the officials in the room at the moment, but it is an issue for the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise policy objective 26 on health, policy objective 27 on water and policy objective 28 on public transport are incredibly vague.  There is no notion of phasing, so there could be significant population growth but there would not necessarily be any requirement, as there would be in a strategic development zone plane, for population growth only to proceed in tandem with very clear targets for the provision of crucial infrastructure.  Deputy Casey mentioned some roads and water infrastructure in his constituency.  We could all mention similar examples of where the existing infrastructure services are not adequate for the populations in the area.  How can we be guaranteed that, with an increase in population, those things will not get worse?<\/p>  <p>  I have made this point on a number of occasions and I will make it again today: this document is completely blind to the spatial dimension of disadvantage and inequality.  That information is there in the small area statistics from the census.  It should be mapped in the document and we should see very clear how a spatial plan gears State agencies and State bodies towards decisions which would tackle the spatial dimensions associated with economic disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  I have huge concerns about the section on housing.  There are some things which make sense, for example, the focus on trying to build up housing supply within existing urban and town areas.<\/p><p> Policy objective 35, to reduce vacancy rates from 9% to 5% by 2040, is a reduction of 0.1% a year over the course of the plan or 4% over 23 years.  That is nowhere near ambitious enough.  Likewise, policy 38 on improving the evidence base for planning is to be welcomed.  This is not a dig at the Minister of State's two officials but, given the difficulties the Department is having in getting figures right for house completions and homelessness numbers, if it cannot do the stuff it is currently doing right how can it convince us that these are the things which will change?<\/p> <p> Another major problem is the North.  There is a chapter entitled \"Ireland in the EU\".  There is no mention of the EU in the eight recommendations in the section.  It is all about the North, and there is only one reference to the island.  It should be called what it is, namely, the all-Ireland dimension to this plan.  Across the seven objectives specific to the North there is, yet again, a lot of vagueness.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, I do not have time to talk about chapters four, six and eight.  They are very important and my party colleagues will deal with them in terms of the environment, Ireland's marine and rural development.<\/p> <p> A lot has to change in terms of the substance of the policy objectives in this document before Sinn F&eacute;in can support it.  We will table detailed amendments next Friday, suggesting changes to the text.  They will be about making the policy objectives firmer and more specific and ambitious.  We also want to introduce a greater element of phasing in terms of what is permissible as one goes through the plan.  <\/p> <p> I support Deputy Casey's argument about the capital plan.  The idea that we could agree a national planning framework without having seen the capital plan seems remiss.  I know it is not within the control of the Department, but it is very important.  <\/p> <p> The document has to have a much stronger all-Ireland dimension.  It should not view the North as simply a neighbour, but rather a central part of any planning framework which considers the island as a whole, in particular for Border communities in the north west.  I do not think the word \"Brexit\" is mentioned once in any of the objectives, despite the fact that it is going to have a ten to 15-year impact, in particular on Border communities.  Objectives to counteract those negative impacts from a planning point of view need to be in place.<\/p> <p> I wish to emphasise once again that socioeconomic disadvantage has a spatial dimension.  It can be mapped.  Every single decision taken in the context of this plan will reinforce or tackle and challenge the spatial dimension of socioeconomic disadvantage.  If it is not in the final draft, it will be one of the deal breakers for Sinn F&eacute;in in terms of our ability to support the plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600005#C00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509010200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I also took the opportunity to send in a submission, on behalf of my party, in the earlier consultation phase.  This has been going on since 2014.  It is a long time and there have been many meetings around the country.  There have been opportunities for submissions and consultations.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State present and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, whether they would consider extending the time limit for submissions on the meat of the plan before 3 November.  While the previous iteration was very general, and contained a lot of good aims and asked a lot of questions of those making submissions to which we responded, it is only now that we have the substance of the plan.  The timeframe within which to make detailed submissions is very short.<\/p><p>I attended a briefing for Deputies and councillors in my local authority last Friday, and I understand there was a similar briefing in Dublin earlier this week.  I presume this is happening around the country.  A very short time is available to take in what one has heard in a briefing and write a submission.  I intend to meet the deadline on behalf of my party and to make a separate submission on Limerick.  There will be a regional submission from my area involving different counties, Shannon Airport etc. <\/p><p>It is a very short time for those who have genuinely engaged with the process.  I ask that consideration be given to extending the time period.  After all, the process started in 2014 and this is the end process.  In a way, this is the period for which more time is required because we are now dealing with what is going into the plan.<\/p><p>I welcome the general ambitions and intentions of the plan.  I understand it is linked to the national investment plan, which we need to see as quickly as possible.  There is a hierarchy of plans, and regional assemblies, local authorities etc. will operate and develop their programmes within the overall context.<\/p><p>I have concerns about the detail of the plan, in particular regarding balanced regional growth.  There is an ambition to deal with the issue, but clearly Ireland is a country which is one of the most imbalanced in the European Union in terms of the eastern and western parts of the country.  I cannot see anything in the plan which will change that.<\/p><p>It is expected that 50% of the growth will be in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, which is fair enough.  I support that.  Approximately 30% more of the growth will involve larger towns and there will be smaller levels of growth in rural areas.  There is a logic to that.  The cut-off point of towns with a population of over 10,000 should be staggered.  There might have to be a cut-off point, but some large towns, such as Drogheda and Wexford, could increase substantially.  Others are just below the 10,000 cut-off and have a lot of potential.  I would not like there to be a fixed figure.<\/p><p>My main point is that if each of the cities doubles in size that will not change the balance.  Dublin and Cork will still be much bigger.  Each of the regions is projected to grow by almost the same percentage over the period involved.  The east and midlands now comprise 49% of the national population, a figure which is projected to decrease to 48% by 2040.  The northern and western regions comprise 18% now, which is projected to be 17% by 2040.  The southern region comprises 33%, which is projected to be 34% by 2040.  In effect, that is not a change.  Rather, it is the <i>status quo.<\/i><\/p><p>I would like to see a lot more ambition for cities and towns, aside from Dublin.  The Dublin area is sprawling and extends out to various counties.  As the Minister said, people are commuting for very long periods.<\/p><p>I will concentrate on Limerick because I know it best.  A city like Limerick has the potential to grow significantly.  I have nothing against Cork, but it is described as a major urban centre in Ireland.  It is stated that the city has positioned itself as a emerging medium-sized European centre of growth and innovation, and building on this potential is critical to further enhancing Ireland's metropolitan profile.  There is no such vision for Limerick, Galway or Waterford, all of which are described as urban centres and important in the context of their region.  There is no description of &quot;major&quot; for them either now or for the future.  There is room for a lot more ambition for other cities and some towns.  If we do not do that, we will be back to where we are now.<\/p><p>2040 is a long way away.  We need to think about what things might be like in 2040 and the potential for growth.  There is significant potential for growth in Limerick.  We have a university, an institute of technology and an international airport on our doorstep.  We have had a lot of success with inward investment.  There is an ambition in the city.  People like John Moran have written articles about this and others share that ambition.  We want to be involved.<\/p><p>In the briefing I attended last week, strong disappointment was expressed that there is not more ambition for Limerick.  What are described as growth enablers could be stronger.  There is no mention of the northern distributor road, which is in the pipeline.  A faster rail link for Cork is mentioned but the report is much less strong about other cities.<\/p><p> A previous speaker referred to ports.  The is greater potential in the ports outside Dublin.  There is a reference to that fact in the framework but perhaps the wording could be stronger.<\/p> <p> There is already spare capacity at Shannon Airport.  There is a great deal more scope to maximise the potential of Shannon Airport.  All of these things would facilitate a city such as Limerick.  As already stated, the same probably applies to Galway and Waterford.  Cork has already been identified as a centre that can grow significantly.  We need to be far more ambitious for areas outside the greater Dublin region in order to achieve that kind of balance.  That is the main point I wanted to make in the context of the framework.<\/p> <p> There is a level of ambition regarding housing, particularly, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin noted, the potential that exists in the context of vacant units.  I agree that there is a much higher level of vacancy in Ireland than in other countries.  There have been some indications that there will be a policy, long-awaited, in respect of vacant housing.  It is the one pillar of Rebuilding Ireland in respect of which detailed plans have not yet emerged.  There is room for development in this area.<\/p> <p> There was a report on health and the health service in the media this morning.  There is a section on health in the framework which deals with the issues that will arise in the future.  There is a real concern that a significant dilemma is going to arise in this area.  There is a population projection available which is higher than the 1 million referred to in the plan.  This may be a statistic that will need to be revisited.<\/p> <p> On environmental issues, there are very good targets and ambitions in respect of climate change, a sustainable environment, etc.  However, what we will need to see is an indication of actions which will ensure that these ambitions are achieved.  I refer here to issues such as carbon mitigation and sustainable transport alternatives.  These could be more specifically addressed in the plan.<\/p> <p> Finally, I welcome the fact that maritime-offshore issues are very much addressed in the framework.  For a long time, we have neglected that area of planning in Ireland.  I note that there is legislation under preparation in that regard.  It is important to recognise that we live on an island, that we are surrounded by a great volume of water and that there is huge potential in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600006#D00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509010800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>We now move to the Rural Independent Group.

There are a few key points that I would like to raise, one of which was already mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Casey.<\/p>  <p>  In looking at rural settlement guidelines, we must have a radical rethink in terms of how we approach building houses in rural Ireland.  The only relevant criteria in this regard is that a new house would be the primary place of residence of the person building it.  Anybody who wants to live in rural Ireland, as long as proper planning guidelines regarding such matters as percolation and road traffic safety can be adhered to, should be given the opportunity to do so on the basis that the house he or she is building will be his or her primary place of residence.  Once that is the case, he or she will contribute to the social and economic fabric of the community.  That is so important in places such as rural Kerry, which I represent, because many of the towns and villages in north and south Kerry - this is borne out by the recent census - are suffering from depopulation, in some cases at a rate of up to 4%.  We need to revitalise those communities.  In order to do so, a radical reconsideration of the rural settlement policies should be undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  I am also interested in the breakdown of how the population will expand in the future and the 50-50 divide between the east coast and the remainder of the country.  The zoning of land in towns and villages is a matter of great interest to me.  In my experience, planners will zone land concentrically from the centre out, which is correct and represents good planning.  However, a great deal of land is zoned in circumstances where landowners have no desire for it to be zoned because they do not want to develop it.  There are vast tracts of zoned land across the country and those who own it have no desire to do anything with it.  This is a matter with which we need to deal.  We either adopt policies whereby we incentivise landowners to ensure that their zoned land is developed or we make provision for broadening out the zoning areas, thereby ensuring that enough houses are built in order to cater for the population.<\/p>  <p>  Another matter about which I am greatly concerned and which I have raised on a number of occasions, particularly on Questions to the Taoiseach a couple of days ago and with the Department and my local authority, is that of turnkey projects in respect of which developers are incentivised.  There were advertisements published in various newspapers to ask developers to submit proposals to build houses and then hand them over, when fully completed, to local authorities.  For this, a 10% down-payment is offered to the developer and the remaining money will be paid on completion.  I have strong evidence that in certain counties, but, in particular, Cork, people can get up to 30% funding for turnkey projects.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, will be aware, a 10% offering is not easily bankable and, therefore, makes the project more difficult to deliver, whereas a 30% offering is far more bankable and will ensure that a project is delivered very quickly.  I have no issue with that.  In the case of Cork, in order for the 30% upfront payment to be made, the site must be transferred to the local authority as a guarantee in the event that something might go wrong and it would be left out of pocket.  Developers all over the country are quite willing to do this.  I really would like an answer in respect of this matter because I know a number of people who have been affected by what is happening.  I want fair play for everybody.  I want the procurement guidelines for every county to be the same and I do not want one county to have a greater advantage over the others.  I want local authorities in all counties to have the ability to deliver these turnkey projects and to be given the same upfront payments in order to make them bankable and deliverable.  That is a reasonable request.  I am fully supportive of what is being done in Cork because the local authority there is trying to get on with dealing with what is a national crisis.  If it is allowed to operate under certain procurement rules, then every other authority should be in a position to do the same.  I really would like an answer in respect of this matter.  I have been running around the place for the past four or five weeks trying to get somebody to provide a definitive answer but one has not been forthcoming.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister of State take my points, particularly the final one, into consideration.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, who kindly offered to share time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600007#E00300","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1509010800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I raised my concerns about the MacKinnon report by means of a Private Members' motion on behalf of the Rural Independent Group.  This report comes under the new national planning framework.  Ireland 2040 is supposed to provide a framework for national planning, pulling together relevant Government policies and investment on national and regional development.<\/p><p>It intends to put a focus on economic development and investment in housing, water services, transport, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure.  However, I do not believe the implementation of the Mackinnon report truly fits into the description of this framework.  The report proposed that Cork City Council's boundary be extended.  This reform would be one of the most significant reforms of local government structures in the history of the State.  It would see the population of the city council area nearly double to 225,000 people.  It is a huge concern for people in my constituency of Cork South-West and in the county generally as the change will result in an estimated loss of &euro;80 million to Cork County Council through commercial rates and property taxes.<\/p> <p> How does this fit in with the intention to improve and invest in housing, transport and water services on a regional and national level as outlined in the national planning framework?  How will this affect places such as Castletownbere, the Mizen Peninsula, Kilcrohane, Durrus, Bantry, Skibbereen, Bandon and Clonakilty?  It will have a detrimental effect throughout west Cork.  It will have a negative effect on the economic development of the Cork County Council area.  It is not appropriate that this report should go into the Ireland 2040 plan.<\/p> <p> The key elements of the new national planning framework are regenerating rural Ireland by promoting environmentally sustainable growth patterns; plan for and implement a better distribution of regional growth in terms of jobs and prosperity; transform settlements of all sizes through imaginative urban regeneration; and bring life and jobs back into cities, towns and villages.  With regard to bringing life back into cities, towns and villages, I do not know how the Minister will do that.  It certainly has not been the policy of either this Government or the last Government to bring life to rural villages.  In the case of planning, every possible obstacle is put before young people who are trying to get planning permission to start their lives in a rural community.  Changes and allowances must be made if the Minister wishes to turn the situation around.<\/p> <p> I live in hope of seeing all the elements happening.  However, with extraordinary growth being encouraged in the capital and little or no plan for rural Ireland I worry that the national planning framework will be little more than a paper exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600007#E00400","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509011400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak on the national planning framework.  It is the most important body of work before this Oireachtas.  We must get it right and learn lessons from the past.  We must be bold, think big and be brave.<\/p>  <p>  I have been very supportive of the process and of the broad outline of what the planning framework is trying to do.  I see three elements from reading the documents and being engaged in the consultation process to date.  One is that we must do everything to decarbonise our economy.  That is how the future economy will be so we must do it.  We also have obligations under the Paris Agreement.  Our island must start being green.  If we are marketing ourselves in that way we must do it in reality.<\/p>  <p>  Second, we must stop the sprawl.  We must start bringing development back close to the centres of villages, towns and cities for a variety of reasons.  The cost of servicing our health, education and transport needs in the same way as we have done in the last 30 years will not be viable.  It will be incredibly expensive.  It does not provide strong social cohesion and simply will not work.<\/p>  <p>  Third, there is the opportunity to reinvigorate Irish politics at local and regional levels.  This should be done not from the top down but by engaging communities, regions and cities and allowing them to come up with ideas on how to implement the aspirations for decarbonising the system and intensifying development so we can reduce our carbon footprint and improve our society.<\/p>  <p>  I do not see the Government doing anything that is aligned with the three objectives which I consider to be central to the plan.  That is my key criticism.  I will outline in simple detail in all three areas where we are not delivering in Government policy what we say we wish to deliver in the framework.  First, with regard to climate, we must have a land use plan if we are going to reduce emissions.  Many of the reductions will come from natural solutions, which will help us to develop biodiversity and improve our landscape.  There is a range of different gains.  However, there is no detail in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers will be the front line and there is an opportunity with the forthcoming revision of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to stitch in what we say we want in the framework in terms of paying farmers for storing carbon, helping with water management and delivering on wildlife.  The way that is done in the Burren is an example, but we must go further.  There was nothing in the recent budget about forestry.  How can we state in the national planning framework that we wish to reduce emissions yet say nothing in the budget about how to develop forestry?  Similarly, in our food system we cannot promote Origin Green if we are not green behind it.  We had an interesting meeting with Bord Bia recently.  We are keen for it to answer the question of what it really means to be Origin Green.  I believe it starts with healthy food that consumers want, supporting local farmers, getting young people back on the land and making food a key employment creator again.  Our current system does not encourage or support that.<\/p>  <p>  We must also examine the development and integration of our national parks and start thinking in a different way in that regard.  If we were serious about this the funding for the National Parks and Wildlife Service would have been doubled in the budget.  It was not.  We spend more on greyhound racing than on the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  That must change.<\/p>  <p>  We are not doing anything on climate change mitigation actions.  We have no offshore wind plan.  We will probably have to hold back on onshore wind generation because we have lost public confidence to a certain extent but that should not stop us pushing a solar revolution, where nothing is happening.  It should not stop us developing our offshore wind resources where there are huge possibilities and capabilities.  It should not stop us developing biomass, not to burn it in a power station which is the least sustainable option but to examine the clever use of biomass at local level.  Again, that ties farmers into this new economy.<\/p>  <p>  Where is the plan to promote electric vehicles as part of this framework?  Where are the plans to ramp up the use of heat pumps rather than burning oil and gas in our homes?  Where is the plan to double and treble the amount of money we are spending on retrofitting insulation?  There is none of that in the current plans.<\/p>  <p>  The same applies to transport.  We do not have a single rail based public transport project ready to go.  This draft document is all about roads.  The recent budget was all about more roads.  How can one talk about concentrating development when one does not promote public transport, cycling and walking?  Where are the plans for the 19th century market towns that are not thriving at present?  Where is the experiment to retrofit certain towns completely and see how it works to get people back living on the main street and get shopping back to the local level rather than in big out-of-town centres?  There is no detail or Government plan behind that objective.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, where is the political change?  Where is there a different regional approach?  The three regions are not appropriate.  Dublin needs a directly elected mayor if we are going to make Dublin work as a medieval city with development coming back close to the core.  A mayor is required because it cannot be done through a regional assembly.  Where is the south-east region?  Waterford could be the capital of the south east.  That would lift all of the region.  Where are the district councils and the ability to match what has happened in Clonakilty, which has a local mayor?  That town is booming because power is being given back to the local area.<\/p>  <p>  The framework wishes to set up a smart growth fund.  I support that, but we should have started in this budget by giving towns and regions the opportunity to bid for this new future.  Some systems will work and some will not.  We will replicate those which work and transform the country.  There is no ambition in the Government to back up this plan and there was nothing in the recent budget to back it up.  We do not even have the draft capital plan while we are discussing the planning framework.  If we were serious about this we would see that level of engagement on the part of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600008#F00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1509011400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>This is an incredibly important debate.  I was in a different location for the debate on the national spatial strategy.  What flowed from that was hubs, gateways, spokes and all sorts of things, which meant nothing was going to happen.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest flaw in the national planning framework is the plan to limit the growth of Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  One cannot stop people having babies, so there will be natural growth.  The only way to limit the growth physically is by not zoning land for housing.  That will increase the price of land and housing enormously.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> Neither do the framework's projections appear to take account of any inward migration in coming years.  There is much talk about Brexit and its opportunities but some of them would require us to assimilate an additional population.  There are good arguments for doing that in the context of the ratio of working population to pensioners and how we project that into the future, for example.  The projections seem to be based entirely on natural growth and even at that, they are very low.  The population growth in Dublin will be higher than projected.  The plan is to limit the growth of Dublin.  It does not make sense.<\/p> <p> I believe in balanced regional development.  Going back to the 1990s, I remember being on the Dublin Transport Initiative, as was Deputy Eamon Ryan who is in the Chamber.  A strategic planning approach was to be deployed and it looked at different scenarios such as scaling up Dublin city in order to limit the sprawl.  In practice, we got the worst-case scenario and now have nine, 10 or maybe 11 counties that have Dublin as their focus, which creates significant traffic congestion.  We must ask why that happened.  It is not enough to have a planning framework as there must be the means of delivering it.  The must be a tie-up between the national capital plan and the national planning framework.  If one seeks to have balanced regional development, it must be about more than merely diverting funds, because funds are required to overcome the difficulties caused by the worst-case scenario.  This will cost us heavily in fines, which focus the mind.  I was told at the Committee of Public Accounts by the Department of Finance that it would be &euro;600 million annually for missing our targets on climate.  Some of that is due to the settlement pattern here and, for instance, we must spend money on the Dart interconnector if we are to overcome the congestion issues as a consequence of that. <\/p> <p> The population changes are interesting.  If one examines the changes between 2001 and 2016 in several locations, one will find that Dublin city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire both grew by 13%, while south Dublin, Fingal, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow grew by 23%, 43%, 44%, 39% and 28%, respectively.  The great increase happened along the arc of Dublin's periphery, with that in Fingal being the largest.  Cork city grew in those years by 1% whereas the county of Cork grew to a greater degree.  Galway grew sequentially, which is unusual.  If we are to have balanced regional development, it must be coherent and sustainable.  That means our city cores must grow but they cannot grow without the infrastructure which provides for a sustainable pattern of growth.  <\/p> <p> I strongly favour balanced regional development because without it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600008#F00300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509012000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The Deputy has well exceeded her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600009#G00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1509012000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am sorry, I will wrap up.

In so doing, I endorse IBEC&rsquo;s call for an ambitious long-term planning and investment strategy for Ireland to redress the growing imbalance between the regions and the greater Dublin area.  The Minster of State and Government understand the importance of redressing this imbalance.  What we need is an implementation mechanism that will deliver change.<\/p>  <p>  I seek confirmation that implementing legislation for the framework will include a requirement for all Departments to prepare budgets in accordance with projected growth figures and that budgets should be allocated accordingly.  It should also include the requirement for a formal review on a biannual basis of actual growth against projected growth and where growth projections are not being met, appropriate action should be taken.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the planned growth in the regions, will the Minister of State confirm that national agencies such as the National Transport Authority and other national entities that are directly funded by the State will be given a mandate encompassing the entire State and not just Dublin?  The impression in rural Ireland is that many national agencies are overly concentrated on Dublin-centric issues.  Galway has a particular problem where some 7,000 workers experience near-constant gridlock in Parkmore business park.  Our national agencies must become more involved in resolving difficulties outside of Dublin.  A number of specific projects are contained in the draft, including the proposed development of a new science and innovation park in Cork.  Will they be replicated in Galway to service the west of Ireland?  <\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister confirm that services required to support the increased population in Galway and the west will be appropriately budgeted for?  Given that the current ageing facilities at University Hospital Galway, UHG, are not fit for purpose and do not provide an appropriate environment to safely manage the current and future care needs of the population of the west and north west, can the Minister confirm that an appropriate budget will be allocated for a new acute hospital to service Galway and the region?  UHG is designated as a centre of excellence for the west and north west, from Donegal down to Clare and as far east as Athlone, covering a population of more than 800,000.  Some 196 senior clinicians working in UHG have told the Minister for Health it is completely unsuitable and a new acute hospital is required urgently.  We can talk about science parks and roads from here to Timbuctoo but the health infrastructure in the west is crumbling and we should reorder our priorities to ensure the more than 800,000 people in the west and north west get the best care in the best facilities possible.<\/p>  <p>  According to projections by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, reported on the news this morning, Ireland&rsquo;s population is on course to increase by almost a quarter by 2030, which, combined with a projected increase of up to 94% in people aged 80 or over, will have significant implications for the health service.  This will have considerable consequences in the west and north west where our hospital infrastructure is already not fit for purpose.  Nobody expects a hospital to appear overnight but we must start planning for a major acute hospital for the region.  Otherwise, as the ESRI report clearly shows, our health service will in no way be able to cater for the increase in population.  <\/p>  <p>  As An Taisce notes, the history of Irish planning has been marked by successive implementation failures of plans and strategies.  It is the biggest obstacle to achieving the goals of any policy.  An Taisce's considered opinion is that the standard necessary to avoid the mistakes of the past is that local authorities and regional assemblies &ldquo;shall comply with the National Planning Framework&rdquo;.  Equally all Government expenditure needs to comply with the national planning framework.  I fully agree with those sentiments.  Most of us in this House have had experience in local government as members of various local authorities.  How many of us have seen various strategies by various Governments go down the black hole of local government?  If this plan is to succeed, it is necessary for the executives of local authorities to be made accountable to Government for the implementation of national policy.  <\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the national planning framework.  I commend the Minster of State on his sterling work to date.

I welcome the plan.  It is very necessary to plan such a distance into the future to ensure balanced regional and national growth.  However, there are gaps in the plan.  Cork will probably grow in this period by 100,000 people, which is very significant growth.  The population of the city council area does not reflect the population of the real metropolitan urban area.  In order to ensure the area is sustainably and properly developed, there is a need for a number of things.  Industry is key.  There is reference in the plan to the need to develop the Port of Cork and some of the docklands areas.

The park has significant potential but it needs to be looked at again.  The city and suburbs will expand and regardless of where boundaries are drawn, by and large, the city will expand to the east and west.  From Ballincollig in the west to Carrigtwohill in the east, one is talking of a span of almost 30 km between the city and the suburbs, yet there is nothing planned for Cork in so far as I can see in terms of additional rail projects.  Road projects are included, which are very important such as the M28, the N40 interchange and the N40 to Limerick.  They are key projects that will make a difference but they will not be able to carry all the additional population.  They might get us another ten or 15 years but that is the extent of it.<\/p>  <p>  About 30 or 40 years ago, there was a land use and transportation strategy in Cork and it laid the foundations for the transport infrastructure we have in terms of the South Ring Road and a variety of other things.  There is a need for something similar now.  If the city is allowed to develop in the geographic way it is planned, there will be a traffic nightmare ahead unless we invest heavily in public transport, in particular on an east-west basis.  It is also key to open up that huge area of the docklands which will facilitate intensive high-density urban development.  That is crucial.  I urge that the current impasse with local government structures is resolved and I am pleased to see there will be dialogue between the two local authorities.  We will see how that will progress but it is vitally important to resolve it.<\/p>  <p>  I will make some general observations, one of which relates to local government.  We have a very weak system of local government in this country.  The vast majority of the powers that are devolved to local government are controlled by executives.  We cannot reasonably expect the other major cities and towns to be able to develop in a balanced way to counteract the extensive growth of Dublin without greater independence being exercised by local elected representatives.  There is an urgent need to examine that issue.<\/p>  <p>  While my constituency is not especially rural, I believe broadband is potentially the game-changer in terms of the development of rural areas.  The ability to allow people to work at home is crucial to ensure sustainable rural communities and strong towns so that people do not have to move to cities to work.  High quality broadband must be a very high priority.<\/p>  <p>  I alluded the transport in the context of Cork specifically but investment in the rail network is crucial, as outlined by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  We cannot keep putting more and more cars onto the roads as that is unsustainable.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; easnamh &aacute;irithe sa ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is seo &oacute; thaobh na Gaolainne.

Language planning is now happening on a geographic basis.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge, under the Acht na Gaeilge, are doing that on a geographic basis.  Language is being planned geographically in the major towns near Gaeltacht areas and in Gaeltacht areas generally and it would be remiss not to make reference to that in this plan.  It could easily be done as so much of the work has been done and it is just a question of integrating it into the overall plan.  I urge the Minister of State to consider that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600010#H00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1509012600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I wish to make a few comments in general on the plan.  I accept it is in draft form but it is quite aspirational and very vague on detail in terms of targeted delivery and specifics.  The plan will go out for public consultation, but we have seen once too often with county development plans that they are merely aspirational and they lie on a shelf gathering dust.  I hope there is far more detail ultimately and that the plan will be backed up with funding.  There was no reference to the plan in the budget in terms of costings or funding being set aside.<\/p>  <p>  I will now examine the plan from a constituency perspective.  Drogheda is the largest town in Ireland and there is no reference whatsoever to it in the plan.  It is the largest town and it is the sixth largest urban centre in Ireland.  In the foreword to the planning framework document, there is an emphasis on balanced development and growth and it states that development should take place at the right time and in the right places.  One cannot ignore the fact that the largest town in Ireland with a population of more than 43,000 is lobbed in with smaller towns of 10,000 plus population in the draft plan.<\/p>  <p>  Drogheda has all the attributes that no other town could claim.  First, we are set right in the centre of the North-South corridor.  We have access to motorway and rail transport.  We are 20 minutes from the State's main airport and we have a thriving port, yet there is no reference to it whatsoever.  If planning is to be strategic and to allow for future development, one cannot simply ignore the largest town and also an entire region and just stick with the five regions identified.  That is not forward planning and it is not proper planning either.<\/p>  <p>  Drogheda was left out of the spatial strategy and we were excluded from the living city initiatives.  We were stripped of the borough council status.  The current Government did that in its previous coalition with the Labour Party.  Drogheda was also stripped of its town clerk and any resemblance of power, local democracy and accountability.  The planning framework looks set to do likewise.  I cannot emphasise enough how perfectly Drogheda is positioned within the north-east region and all the attributes it has to recommend its inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  The current extended population of Drogheda is already larger than that of Waterford city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600010#H00400","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1509012600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600010#H00500","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1509012600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>At the time Galway was awarded city status in the 1980s, its population was less than the current population of Drogheda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600010#H00600","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1509012600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Fake news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600010#H00700","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1509012600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>If the plan is to have any real effect and if it is to plan for future development and prosperity and give areas a chance, I urge the Minister of State not alone to award city status to Drogheda, but to give it the opportunity to realise its potential and enhance the future of the town and its citizens.<\/p><p>People should not be invited to make submissions if there is no intention of paying heed to them or taking them on board.<\/p><p>The spatial strategy was that kind of document.

I agree with that, but at the moment it only has the potential to be important and make a difference.  When I go through this document there is a deficit.  I do not see that the ambitions contained within each chapter of this document are cognisant of the submissions and the input of those that sought to have an influence on the final document.  That is regrettable.  There were 1,000 submissions, but I would prefer that they were grouped, summarised and the key elements pertaining to different sections outlined so that we could get some cohesion for the finished product.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I agreed with him when he talks about a planning framework which is not associated with the infrastructural plan, which is due shortly.  I know that the two cannot necessarily be published together, but the Minister said that the national planning framework will be backed up by the infrastructural plan.  There have to be ambitious targets for roads, rail and public transport.  There has to be provision for broadband, education, further education, lifetime education and apprenticeships, public and civic services, hospital infrastructure and primary care infrastructure, home helps and assisting the elderly to remain in their communities, and housing provision.  We have all spoken about sustainable housing provision and stopping the sprawl by working with what we have available in terms of in-fill sites and addressing what is contained within the Vacant Homes Refurbishment Bill.  That can be done forthwith.  We do not necessarily need a planning framework to provide a pathway for that.  Deputy Ryan was quite right to ask what innovation is contained within this framework to help and assist in addition to those ways of regenerating, revitalising and re-energising towns.  What other ideas or innovations are contained in this plan to address those issues?  The greatest sin of the last number of years is the dilapidation that exists and the lack of energy and vibrancy in many towns and villages throughout the country.  That issue should be paramount in any national planning framework.<\/p>  <p>  Where are we on innovation and enterprise?  We talk about greening our economy, but where is the provision for enterprise and innovation?  Where is the fund that various regions need in order to engender that?  We have spoken about de-carbonising.  We have a carbon tax that I do not believe is being put to the correct use.  I have been saying this consistently, especially in my own region.  We are moving away from excavating turf and from Bord na M&oacute;na, which will no longer be what it was beyond 2030.  The region that I represent, and far beyond it, does not have a plan or process of Government subvention to assist it to replace that industry.  I have said consistently that the last Government reintroduced a carbon tax, doubled it and took away the provisions that was previously available for Bord na M&oacute;na products.  That would be fine if the revenue generated from that was pumped back into those regions in the form of innovation and enterprise funds to allow the regions to replace the turf industry and provide work and potential for growth.  Perhaps we would see progress then.<\/p>  <p>  I will pick out certain aspects of this document in the time available to me but will make a more detailed written response in due course.  I commend the Minister for acquiescing to a request for an extension.  The deadline is now 10 November, rather than 3 November.  That is based on the feedback I have been receiving in my constituency and also from my colleagues in the parliamentary party.  It is only when the draft document appears that we can begin to analyse and scrutinise it properly and effectively in order to seek to ensure that there is a more universal support for any future document.  I welcome the legislation that will back up the creation of an independent office for planning regulation.  It has been sought in recent years and it is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  The document mentions that there are to be regular reviews and updates.  I would prefer if it stipulated when these regular reviews and updates will take place.  If this plan is to last until 2040, as is the aspiration, it should take into account that area plans, county development plans and regional plans are of much shorter duration.  They need to be in synch with the overall plan.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the commitment to end the sprawl that we have seen, especially in Dublin.  That has to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The plan discusses social disadvantage and inequality.  It will involve Government intervention and subvention for those regions which are least well off in order to bring them to par.<\/p>  <p>  Local development plans and area plans have sought to ensure the sustainability of rural areas.  They have sought to assist land owners and their family members to live on their own lands.  There are contradictions within this relating to aspirations and the hierarchy of plans, which seem to indicate that local area plans and county development plans will now have to adopt this economic need.  In my county there is a functional need which carries greater weight than the local need, and it is causing great difficulty.  I hope that will be addressed in the next local development plan, if not by material contravention in the meantime.  I do not believe that the hierarchy, if it is an aspiration of this plan, can be adhered to in its entirety.  Some leeway should be given to local authorities on the area plans based on the type of county affected, the make up of it and the potential for growth in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's plan discusses learning from the previous spatial strategy, which was scrapped in 2012.  There has been nothing for the last five years, and hopefully we are about to get a replacement.  The new plans say that the old plan failed because there were winners and losers when it came to gateways and hubs.  In my region, Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore was to be a gateway region where development would take place.  Great synergy was developed between the three towns, the three chambers and between industry.  IBEC, ISME and others bought into that concept.  It was working well and had the potential to work well into the future.  However, this process has seen Athlone break away.  The aspiration of Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran was that it would get city status and would be far greater than anything else east of the Pale.  It is obviously not the case and should not be the case.<\/p><p>It is incumbent on the Government to help such towns.  Those involved in the towns are prepared to work together for the betterment of the region in its entirety and they should be rewarded.  It is extraordinary to realise that they can now only have potential growth of 20% without any review of that assertion.  There should be an immediate review if those caps are reached at an earlier stage.<\/p> <p> It would appear that I am now charged with responsibility in my region, county or constituency to try to bring all the submissions together from the various bodies, including IBEC, ISME, the IFA, RGDATA and other groups to see what commonality exists within the region in respect of their aspirations.  Each region should have three or four key infrastructural priorities to help to ensure each priority represents the foundation for future growth.  Again, that should be contained within the national planning framework.  It should be supported and followed through with a national infrastructural plan, which would put meat on the bones and money in the regions.  This is what I am asking the Government to consider when it comes to the final document.  I implore the Government to realise that while this is a draft document and a great deal of work has gone into it, much needs to be changed and there is a different way in which this can be approached.  I appeal to the Government to be cognisant of the input of Deputies, who represent the various constituencies and bring depth of experience and knowledge to the process.  I hope that will be reflected in the new document.  It is incumbent on all of us to make detailed written submissions to try to get the level of consent that we believe to be necessary for the framework document and to give the infrastructural plan the back-up it needs to allow it to become a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600011#J00200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509013800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Maria Bailey.

This has been a long process.  We have heard many comments from people who have said they did not have the opportunity for consultation or to make their views heard.  Some have said that there has not been a bottom-up approach or that it has not been diverse enough.  Others have said that there has not been an extensive consultation.<\/p>  <p>  I am keen to put on the record that over 40 regional events have been held throughout the country in order to make people aware of the national planning framework, what it is about, what it encompasses and the direction in which the country will go over the next 25 years.  These 40 regional events have taken place since 2 February.  Therefore, there has been a lengthy period of ten months for consultation.  This document was not thrown together in a matter of weeks.  I attended several of the events to which I refer because I have no wish to be Dublin-centric.  I am keen to represent the country as a whole.  At the events, many of the comments raised are echoed in the submissions, of which there have been almost 1,000.  We can read these comments, which are included in the draft document.  It is unfair to say that they have not been taken on board.  In fact, it is somewhat insulting to say so.  I appreciate the vast work that has gone into putting this document together.  It is a little disrespectful to say that comments have not been taken on board.<\/p>  <p>  We should not go back to being parochial about the areas we represent.  We need only look at the spatial plans of the past, which threw in every town that was named by every public representative.  If we do that, then we will go nowhere.  This must be a targeted approach for sustainable growth for our country and quality of life for our citizens.  It cannot come down to naming every town in the country or throwing in everything, including the kitchen sink.  That is not what proper planning is about.<\/p>  <p>  What will Ireland look like in 2040?  What do we need to do?  We need to plan for the needs of our future population.  In that context, we must make a long-term plan rather than arrive at a quick fix.  It is more important to do the right thing, which is often more difficult.  It would be easy to name every town in the country.  This is a proper document, unlike previous plans.  It will be a statutory document, something we have never had before.  That is why I believe in this plan.  I am of the view that it will give my children and other children a future when they are older, whether in respect of school, employment, housing, jobs, tourism or whatever.  It will give them options.<\/p>  <p>  This plan is ambitious.  It is ambitious because it is realistic and deliverable.  It will give rise to many challenges but these will be challenges we will be able to surmount.  Nothing is insurmountable.  There are extraordinary opportunities and potential in the rural areas of our country and these have not yet been realised.  However, we are addressing them in this national development plan.  It is true that I represent a Dublin constituency.  However, I am a national parliamentarian who has a big vision for our country.  I can see the drive and the heart of our people and their willingness to better themselves all the time.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the national planning framework will be as important as preparing it.  Let us consider what is happening at present, especially in the context of housing, the satellite towns that surround Dublin and quality of life.  Currently, approximately 10,000 people commute from Portlaoise to Dublin every day in order to get to work.  While that might suit some, for others it does not represent quality of life.  It can mean leaving before the children get up in the morning and getting home after they are in bed.  It means not having quality of life with family and living in the car for an hour and a half each morning and evening.  That is not reflective of proper planning and we need to rectify it.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be flexible in respect of what our needs will be for the population growth that we know will materialise.  We have to develop the country as a whole rather than be Dublin-centric.  We risk choking Dublin and diminishing the quality of life here, while starving the regions of much-needed development and growth, whether in the context of investment in indigenous business, foreign direct investment or whatever.  The point is that the opportunity has to be available.  We can continue to develop the east coast if we so choose, but that would not represent sustainable or proper planning for our country.<\/p>  <p>  We need to reduce our carbon footprint by integrating climate action into the planning system in support of national targets for climate policy and mitigation objectives, as well as targeting our greenhouse gas emissions.  Our planning system needs to be responsive to environmental challenges.  I welcome the comments in the national planning framework in this regard.  We need to realise our island and marine potential with integrated land and maritime planning.  We need to ensure that our ports are aligned in order to ensure the effective growth and sustainable development of our cities and regions in the context of fisheries, renewable energy, marine tourism and other potential areas for industrial development.<\/p>  <p>  Some 40% of Ireland's population live within 5 km of the coast.  I am one of the lucky 40%.  Our coastal areas are key drivers for our tourism sector.  We need only consider the success of the Wild Atlantic Way in this regard.  We need to ensure that our coastal resource is managed in order to sustain its physical character and environmental quality while building on the existing natural asset.  This is about managing land use and the movement of people as well as creating a quality of life for all.<\/p>  <p>  All of this should happen while recognising the population growth and demographic changes that are expected.  There will be approximately 1.3 million people over the age of 65 years by 2040.  We need to plan for their needs in vibrant communities, whether in health, housing, employment, recreational or other areas.<\/p>  <p>  As the economy continues its recovery and as we build more houses and improve the lives of people locked out of the housing market or trapped in emergency accommodation, one key challenge for all of us will be around expectations.  The challenge will be to meet the expectations of people when it comes to important quality-of-life issues.  Let us put this in context.  In the context of planning we need to make homes more flexible and adaptable for people throughout their lives.  This should be the case regardless of whether a home is a first home, a family home or a home for later in life.  We need to create an environment where a person can choose to downsize to a managed and secure complex within her community that will cater for her needs, give her security, independence and familiarity.  We need to develop communities that will cater to a person's needs from the time she is born to the time she passes.<\/p>  <p>  We need a whole-of-Government approach to this plan.  We need a whole-of-Ireland approach rather than the piecemeal approaches of the past.  That was not proper planning.  For the first time in my political career, I am lucky to be in a position to be part of the process relating to a document such as this, which, I believe, gives us the greatest opportunity as a country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600012#K00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1509013800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bailey for sharing time.  I was keen to make some points and I was afraid that I would not get in if I did not ask her for some time.<\/p><p>The debate thus far clearly exemplifies the divergence of opinion that exists on planning matters in Irish politics in general.<\/p><p>In this Chamber, diametrically opposed opinions have been expressed, even in the hour and a half in which we have heard speakers.  This is best exemplified by the contributions in the slot shared by Deputies Eamon Ryan and Catherine Murphy.  I acknowledge they are in different political parties but their views were quite different even though they represent constituencies that are not that far apart geographically.  Despite this, they were both significantly right in large parts of their contributions.<\/p> <p> On Deputy Eamon Ryan's point on densities, I may be mistaken but believe I read recently that a former Member of the House from the Green Party, now a councillor, expressed regret over the recent proposal by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to remove height caps in Dublin city centre.  Perhaps it is not the only way density can be increased in the city centre but it is certainly an obvious way.  Deputy Catherine Murphy's point, that we cannot stop people from having children, goes without answering.<\/p> <p> Deputy Casey, in an extraordinary contribution, praised the spatial strategy, which I do not believe I have ever heard a public representative praise, and had a go at the framework for not being specific enough.  The purpose of this debate and others, and the public consultation, is to put more flesh on the bones.  I commend my two ministerial colleagues and others in the Department who have put in such work on the planning framework.  It is just that, a framework.  It will not be prescriptive regarding the nitty-gritty of every local authority's development plan but it will set national targets and objectives.  That is the right thing to do.<\/p> <p> I agree with most of what Deputy Cowen said.  I was surprised to hear his lament for the demise of the Bermuda triangle of Tullamore, Athlone and Mullingar.  I suspect there will hardly be a protest march in those towns over its demise.  Perhaps the best example of why the spatial strategy did not really work is the fact that it was not an entity that had any buy-in from the general public.  It might have had buy-in from the groups the Deputy mentioned, but it did not really mean anything to the broader public.<\/p> <p> I have two remaining points.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, or perhaps another Deputy, alluded to broadband and Wi-Fi.  We saw the benefits best recently during Storm Ophelia when, despite the fact that the country was closed for a day or a little more, much business continued because people could work from home.  There is a significant number of people, particularly along the east coast but also in other parts of the country, who commute huge distances but who would be in a position to work from home much more if the appropriate facilitates were more widely available.  I cannot emphasise enough the significance I attach to this.<\/p> <p> My view on this is biased but I will express it anyway.  There are two regions of the country more ripe for development than any others, for very different reasons.  The north west, to the line from Galway to Dublin, lacks a major urban centre.  This must be and is being addressed in the framework.  The other region is mine, the south east.  The latter has three motorways, two railway lines, an airport and three ports but it has the lowest average household income and the highest unemployment rate, which is 3% above the national average.  Despite these statistics, it is the closest region to the Cork-Dublin axis.  Why has this trend persisted for my entire lifetime, amounting to almost 40 years?  I know efforts are being made in the plan to ensure the region, which can be developed rapidly because of its infrastructural advantages and location-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600012#K00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509014400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Make it a region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600013#L00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1509014400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Once voice.

I have a great passion for the subject.  Of all the debates in the Chamber this week - there have been some very serious ones - this is one of the most important because it will have an impact on people's lives today and in the future.  The questions to be asked are stark.  Will the plan shape those lives for the better or the worse?  Will it give the same fair chance to everyone?  The plan actually uses such language at the get-go.  It refers to a sense of fair play and opportunity for all, and to social inclusion irrespective of location.  When the Minister of State says the plan does not get into the nitty-gritty, and that it should not, he should note it states there should be fairness for everyone in the country, irrespective of location.  Location is at the heart of the plan.  Where one lives and where jobs and investment go determine whether one will have a fair crack at life.  Therefore, location goes to the heart of a framework plan.<\/p>  <p>  The key issue is how the objectives of the plan, set out in flowery language, will be achieved.  A great deal of this, if not all, will be premised on the capital investment plan.  The framework plan comes first but it is written in full knowledge of what is in the capital investment plan.  It is a chicken-and-egg scenario.  Consider the expected growth and how it will be dispersed in the three regions under the plan, with the greater Dublin area accounting for some 500,000 and Dublin accounting for nearly 300,000, and the rest in the commuter counties.

I agree with the need to address in-fill in town centres where opportunities present, but it must be backed up with Government incentives, as happened previously when urban renewable and tax incentive schemes incentivised such development.

They passed their judgment on that matter last year, so it is disheartening to see that ethos nearly being copperfastened in black and white in the plan.  Instead of making a genuine attempt to try to reverse it, the plan only compounds it.  The plan asks what will happen if nothing is done.

The strategy will determine the future of our country up to 2040, in particular how towns and cities develop.

According to the document, if a community reaches a population of 50,000, it is a city<i>ipso facto<\/i>and must be treated as one.  The plan mentions many cities, but the one that is missing is the most important of all and is where I live.  The greater Drogheda area has, according to the census, more than 80,000 people in it.  That the plan does not recognise that fact is of concern.<\/p><p>It is not true to say that towns are not mentioned.  A town is, and I have no difficulty with that reference.  Figure 7.2 on cross-Border co-operation reads: &quot;Develop the critical mass of the Newry-Dundalk area to compete with other larger cities.&quot;  I welcome this objective.  I never had a difficulty with that.  Neither did the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, of which I am a member, when it agreed today to include Drogheda as a third point in the Newry-Dundalk axis as part of a larger city or separately as its own city.

Deputy Breathnach was a councillor when Louth and Meath county councils agreed a development plan for the greater Drogheda area.  What was wrong with it?  It was quite a good plan.  When it went forward for approval, however, it had no standing because it was not a statutory plan and the local municipal committee in east Meath kicked it out, leading to an appalling planning miasma in which there were houses without services and shopping centres without shoppers.  Hundreds of houses were built without any sewerage facilities.  The sewage was being moved at night in tankers.  There was appalling and disgraceful carry-on in east Meath in terms of planning.  It happened because there was not a proper plan or the proper plan was neglected and the councillors took over.

Education services in Meath and Louth work together.  There is already considerable co-operation, but we need greater administrative co-operation to put in place a planning and control infrastructure in local government that is based on the area in question.  An imaginative solution is what we need.  Our health services are served from Drogheda.  There is great interaction on that front.

It has added another chapter to the ever-enlarging book entitled <i>Wrongdoing by Irish Banks<\/i>.  One always knows when a story is getting too hot and uncomfortable for certain institutions when their spin doctors tell them not to do interviews and to go to ground.  We reached that stage of the story this morning when none of the banks would make themselves available for interviews on radio.  Their silence is indicative of the fact that they know their actions are and were indefensible.<\/p><p>Banks are not above the law and they are not entitled to disregard proper principles of corporate governance.  That is particularly true in this instance in this country because the very same banks benefitted from the people of this country making the decision to bail them out when their previous over-speculation and reckless lending had the effect of causing a banking collapse.  The news that the majority of banks in Ireland were engaged in fraudulently increasing mortgage rates for people on tracker mortgages first came into the public domain approximately seven years ago.  Faith was put in the Central Bank to resolve it, but that faith, unfortunately, was misplaced.  We were supposed to have a report in 2015 but all that has happened since is that some AIB customers have had their rates corrected and some in other banks have had that as well as receiving some compensation.  The pace is far too slow.<\/p><p>This story was brought to a heightened level when the finance committee invited individuals to give their personal stories as to what had happened to them in their lives as a result of the fraudulent behaviour of the banks.  We got a further example of that today on the radio when Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Redmond was interviewed and explained what had happened to her as a result of the banks moving her off a rate to which she was entitled.  She told listeners to the radio this morning that she had to pay an extra &euro;500 per month, which was an excessive amount of money for any person and which had a significant impact on her ability to deal with her household expenses.  She also said it took from 2010 to December 2016 to get the bank to correct her rate.  Like me, she has little faith in the banks' claim that they will be able to deal with this issue by June of next year.<\/p><p>I do not hold the Government responsible for the reckless behaviour of the banks, but it is responsible for the State's response.  I am afraid that the response of the State and the Government to date has been pathetic.  We were told initially by the Minister for Finance that he would name the banks, which obviously really scared them.  We were then told last week by the Taoiseach that he was losing patience with the banks.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance said he will hold the banks responsible and to account.  What is the Government going to do in respect of this issue?  Is legislation going to be introduced and if so what will it provide for?  Mention has also been made of the State playing the role of activist shareholder at meetings of banks in which it holds shares.  What resolutions will it put down?

Some families have lost their homes, others have suffered various terrible mental health stresses, marriages have been affected and there have been years of unnecessary pressure on people who were doing their best to invest in their own futures.

Deadlines are now in place by which these issues must be addressed and the Minister has made it very clear that if there is any delay, the Governor of the Central Bank has been asked to come back and report on progress by mid-December.  The Minister has made it clear that if those deadlines are not met, a range of actions are open to him which he will not hesitate to take.

There is a long history in this country and, indeed, elsewhere of difficulty in securing convictions in respect of sexual offences.  There is also a long history here and elsewhere of a belief that the sentencing does not reflect the seriousness of the crime.  I am on record again and again as saying that I do not believe that enough attention has been paid to victims in our legal system and I reiterate that this afternoon.  We need a sea change in attitudes to victims across the criminal justice system.  That is why the Government introduced victims of crime legislation in line with an EU directive, which, thankfully, is leading the way in that change.  I believe as that change takes hold, some of the issues to which the Deputy referred will be dealt with more robustly and more appropriately within our system.<\/p>  <p>  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, sentencing is a matter for the Judiciary.  We respect the separation of powers in this country.  The sentencing regime for sexual crimes has been greatly strengthened in recent years.  For example, as the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which I introduced last year, has much stronger sanctions in respect of online grooming.  The Act introduces a specific offence relating to the use of information and communications technology to facilitate the sexual exploitation of a child.  It was extremely important that the House passed the legislation because there are new forms of interaction with young children on the Internet, which makes them extremely vulnerable to sexual grooming and sexual exploitation.  There is a huge educational job as well for all of us to do.  The reality is our criminal law is strong in respect of the sanctions and penalties judges can hand down but in each case, it is a matter for the Judiciary and it is not open to Ministers or any other Member to intervene in any way regarding how a particular case is conducted or in the outcome of such proceedings.  I hope I have made it clear that, from the Government's point of view, we take these sexual violence offences extremely seriously and we have introduced stronger legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600016#O01700","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1509016200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>All of us appreciate and value the independence of the Judiciary, the separation of powers and the necessity for an independent Judiciary.

It is our job, as legislators, to decide upon a framework within which the Judiciary might independently operate and that is the proposition I am putting to the T&aacute;naiste.  We are largely in agreement and I do not for a moment gainsay her concern for victims.  I absolutely acknowledge and appreciate that.

In 2015, my colleague, Senator P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn, and, in 2017, my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, introduced sentencing council Bills.  I am trying to win the T&aacute;naiste over to the merits of that approach, not to mandatory sentencing but to guidelines that would have the dual advantage of, one the one hand, affording guidance, not direction, to the Bench, but also a mechanism that would massively enhance public confidence, which has been dented, in the sentencing policy of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600016#O01800","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1509016200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Clearly, in court the issues in each case have to be examined but I take the view, as does the Deputy, that consistency of sentencing is an important issue.

That will be a valuable tool for the Judiciary and for the public's understanding of sentencing regimes and how they work.  A report of the working group on the strategic review of penal policy was published in June 2014 following excellent work.  It was a broad ranging report on this policy but they examined the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.

From Ansbacher to the DIRT inquiry, we saw the banks do serious harm, and then they brought our country to its knees with reckless lending.  Now, just a few years later, we have another scandal.  While posting billions of euros in profits, they have systematically defrauded tens of thousands of our people.  Yesterday, we heard from the Minister for Finance on the scandal.  As Miriam Lord wryly noted in a newspaper this morning, \"he has demanded two more reports from the Central Bank to join all the other ones and he should be in a position to be very definitive about something one way or another in about six months' time\".  The Minister refused to outline any potential sanctions that might actually be imposed on the banks.  More than two years have passed since the Central Bank began its investigation.  Some 20,000 customers have been definitely impacted, and possibly 30,000.  We know that 23 families have had their homes repossessed and another 79 were dragged through the courts for repossession of buy-to-let properties.  The human toll is not limited to these cases.  During some of the toughest years of our economy, people were faced with scandalous overcharging of tens of thousands of euro.  The scale of human misery involved is immense, yet the Minister for Finance cannot tell us what sanctions these banks might face.<\/p>  <p>  Several things seem abundantly clear to us.  First, under the 2013 Act that we introduced, the Central Bank has the power to direct banks to pay redress.  Therefore, it should be doing so now for all post-2013 cases.  Second, it must set out a speedy system of external oversight to identify any customer not yet known to have been defrauded.  Third, it seems clear to anyone watching that this was cartel-like behaviour, with each of the banks perpetrating the same fraud.  It is simply not good enough to be told that the Central Bank is liaising with or had meetings with the Garda.  The T&aacute;naiste must tell the House what the Government intends to do to pursue any criminal activity and ensure that it is fully investigated.  We have to see some personal accountability.  Finally, in this country, individuals - real people - as well as systems and culture must be held to account.  It will not be good enough to reach the end of this latest banking scandal and say that everyone has received compensation so business should return to normal.

The Deputy knows the range of initiatives which have been taken to ensure that there the situation was changed, but the emergence of the details and the horror of the situation has brought home to us once again the extreme importance of regulation and monitoring as well as the role of the Central Bank and the need for that role to be robust in the extreme.  The Deputy spoke about the Central Banking having the power to ensure redress.  That is precisely what the Minister has said will happen by the end of December.

The Governor and the Minister have made it absolutely clear that they expect the banks to move immediately on redress, and we are talking about weeks and not months.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy spoke about whether there was fraud.  The determination of whether fraud has taken place, criminal proceedings should be brought or a cartel has operated are matters for the independent statutory bodies, namely, the Central Bank, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Central Bank has well-established arrangements to liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where there is any suspicion of criminal investigation.  I suppose one could say that they are at the middle point of their probe and we have to await its results.  None of us here wants to jeopardise any potential enforcement actions or prosecutions in these matters.  We do not decide on the bringing of criminal prosecutions at a political level; that is a decision for the relevant authorities.  The Minister is determined that there will be a thorough and rigorous examination of the issues in terms of what has happened to people, which is why he asked the Governor of the Central Bank to do the further report on the broader issue of how this could have happened and the cultural factors that led to it.

I was responding to great distress of constituents who sent me photographs and video recordings of cars being burnt out in broad daylight.  I was told of appalling anti-social and criminal behaviour as up to five and six vehicles were recklessly driven around estates and then set on fire in nightly episodes often lasting until 6 a.m.  This outrageous behaviour is incredibly dangerous, as homes were effectively blockaded by abandoned and burning vehicles and the lives of families and local children were put at risk.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the initial response of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in mid-summer was very slow due to what is widely perceived as a lack of resources, especially in community policing.  Following urgent requests from community leaders, development bodies and local public representatives, a policing plan was finally implemented and resulted in a reduction in this crime.  However, it persists, with several incidents each week.  Communities are fearful that the forthcoming Hallowe'en festival will be used by alleged miscreants and ringleaders to set off another orgy of vandalism and burning of vehicles, with all the associated drink and drug-fuelled mayhem.<\/p><p>This sets a terrible example for children and teenagers in communities whose citizens have striven hard to create safe and secure neighbourhoods.  This appalling anti-social behaviour is part of a general increase in such behaviour across Dublin Bay North and other constituencies.  My office often receives reports of intimidation of families and households, widespread vandalism of public facilities, including DART and Irish Rail stations, unauthorised and dangerous use of quad vehicles and scrambler motorcycles in public parks, burglaries, a plague of graffiti and other nuisances.  What action is the Minister for Justice and Equality taking to address this problem?<br\/><br\/>The T&aacute;naiste, in her previous role as Minister for Justice and Equality, bears a major responsibility in this regard, having slashed Garda numbers, particularly in the area of community policing.  Last year, for example, the number of garda&iacute; in the R and J districts of Garda division DMR north stood at only 202 and 160, respectively.  The J district alone has lost nearly 60 garda&iacute; since 2010 and the economic crash, an issue discussed in the House a moment ago.  The number of community garda&iacute; was also substantially reduced during this period.  When I contacted the current Minister for Justice and Equality in July, he stressed the importance of the Garda national model of community policing and indicated that new community policing teams would be introduced in each Garda district in accordance with the Garda Act 2005 and the Garda Inspectorate report of 2007.  Many citizens will agree with former garda, Mr. Trevor Laffan, who wrote on <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>that &quot;community policing no longer exists&quot; as a result of the actions of the past two austerity Governments.<br\/><br\/>I have no doubt that the T&aacute;naiste will refer to the plan to have 21,000 garda&iacute; and other staff in place by 2021 and I obviously welcome this measure.  However, what we need is the urgent roll-out of community policing teams in my constituency and other constituencies.  Will the Government give a commitment to having community policing put back at the heart of the policing service and increasing the visibility of community garda&iacute;?<br\/><br\/>What steps are being taken to apprehend the ringleaders involved in the appalling anti-social behaviour I have described, to caution them, to link them with juvenile liaison officers and, if necessary, to prosecute them?  What is being done to identify and prosecute adults selling or transferring cars and other vehicles to children?  Legislation I introduced in this area some 15 years ago on behalf of the Labour Party remains the law of the land.  However, it appears that it is not being implemented because the supply of vehicles to children has not been stopped.

The Deputy's statement that this Government or that which preceded it cut back on Garda numbers is incorrect; the opposite is the case.  Budget 2018 provides for the recruitment of 800 additional garda&iacute; and 500 civilians to fill critical skills gaps across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to ensure that garda&iacute; move from administrative work into front-line duties in order that the very behaviour about which the Deputy spoke can be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  As far as other initiatives are concerned, deterrents must be in place and sentencing much reflect the seriousness of the crime.

Last year the capital programme for schools was &euro;334 million.  This year the Government has only provided &euro;338 million.

Often they do not have the resources or technical expertise in the school community.  Will the Government help these schools out of the hole they are in?

and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;further notes:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that this House has passed several motions and legislation pertaining to the housing crisis over the past number of years and the Government has had four housing Ministers, four policies and numerous launches since 2014;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the State has built fewer than 3,500 social homes since 2011, less than the number constructed every year on average from 1994 to 2010;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that fewer than 600 new social homes will be constructed in 2017 when the Rebuilding Ireland target is 5,000;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that only 24% of 10,000 units in the &lsquo;construction pipeline&rsquo; are on site, so it will be 2021 before most are built compared to the already unambitious target of 26,000 units;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that despite announcements in Budget 2018, the overall housing budget is too low and skewed toward current housing programmes, such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the capital house building budget - &euro;730 million in 2017 and &euro;1.14 billion in 2018 - is still 24% below 2008 levels;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that, as a result, insufficient housing stock is being added as social housing provision coming from the private rental and owner-occupier market;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that due to years of under-supply and pent-up demand, Ireland needs 40,000 to 50,000 new homes per year to make a dent in demand and a noticeable impact on affordability;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Government target is 25,000 by 2021 and 15,000 to 18,000 new units expected in 2017;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that clearly there is a market failure in housing and new interventions are required to stimulate supply;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Government&rsquo;s reluctance to accept the actual challenges and its refusal to make any interventions in the housing market is making a crisis situation worse;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to initiate an affordable housing scheme and the failure of the Government to date to reintroduce affordable housing initiatives for low  and middle-income households;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that it is in the area of homelessness that the Government&rsquo;s inept housing policy really comes into plain view, and the abandonment of targets on hotel accommodation and continuing failure to make a dent in rising homeless figures cannot continue to be ignored;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution, outlining economic, cultural and social rights to be enshrined in the Constitution of Ireland, including the right to housing legislation, is currently before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to increase funding for a special resolution fund for unfinished homes; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; acknowledge the pressing need for delivery over spin in addressing the housing crisis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; commit to meeting the Rebuilding Ireland targets on moving homeless families out of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation by the end of 2017;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; revise the emergency homeless strategy, in particular, redesigning homeless HAP and the HAP scheme, so households are not discouraged from taking up tenancies and are not removed from main social housing waiting lists;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; continue to increase and rebalance the housing budget toward capital expenditure;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; accelerate the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland, utilise National Asset Management Agency proceeds and expertise to invest in housing and develop new vehicles to enable off-balance sheet funding for social housing projects from private sources and the credit union movement across Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; devise a strategy to enable and encourage far greater scale and size in social house building projects;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; recognise the significant market failures in housing, including in planning, finance, infrastructure and costs of construction, which the market requires State intervention to overcome;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; acknowledge that the Government&rsquo;s target of 25,000 new house completions by 2021 is not adequate, given years of pent-up demand and under-supply, and that at a minimum we need 45,000 to 50,000 units output annually over the next few years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; commit to reintroducing affordable housing schemes, including affordable owner-occupier and rental housing schemes, for middle-income households and explore possible financial incentives aimed at encouraging development of housing at more affordable price points;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce financial incentives to build high-density developments, where they are currently not commercially viable to build, in Dublin City and other local authorities;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; commit to greater enforcement and implementation of rent pressure zones and other rent regulations including more staffing and resources for the Residential Tenancies Board;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; tackle land hoarding by large investors, which is clearly holding back supply including by making changes to capital gains tax and introducing a new site tax to encourage the use of empty sites; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

What I am really talking about is the future of the greater Drogheda area, which has a population, by any projection, be they those of the Department or our own community, definitely in excess of the 50,000 persons which is the requirement to be a city.  What has the greater Drogheda area got that will attract the decision of the Government and attract inward investment?  We have high capacity broadband, the best in the country, which runs right through our town.  We have top class motorway connections and a rail connection.  We also have some infrastructural deficits which can and will be met by city investment.  For instance, the Drogheda northern cross route, which is an access route for thousands of houses which have been in design and planning for a long time, could be constructed if the funding is found nationally to assist in its construction.  To link up the north and south, we need a new bridge on the east of the town, which would link up the port and port developments to east Meath and right out onto the motorway.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, most of all, we need a town manager or a manager for what I will call the GDA, the greater Drogheda area.  If we put in place a CEO with the salary of the chief executive of a county council to manage the greater Drogheda area, working with and associating with a new initiative of the managers in both Meath and Louth, it could be an imaginative solution in terms of finding a way around the impasse about extending boundaries.  I personally would have no problem extending the boundary.  The population is expanding and it is clear the population needs will only be met by proper, single decisive authority for this area.  It is a question of developing that through the process to which I have referred, and a city manager will make all the difference.<\/p>  <p>  We have other infrastructure requirements.  There is no LEO for the 60,000 people who live in the area and such an office would add to the capacity of the town to assist in job creation.<\/p>  <p>  I would add that Drogheda has a vision.  The Mill in Drogheda has a vision for our business people.  The proposed M1 payments corridor is an example of the potential enterprise and job growth that can be achieved in Drogheda and the greater area.  I feel it is a very attractive location for FinTech companies.  There are many local players who are looking at how Drogheda and the whole corridor could develop in this sector.  I very much welcome the discussions around that issue locally, and I hope they will be listened to nationally.<\/p>  <p>  The plan for our area can only be decided by the people of the area.  The centre of gravity and decision making in Meath is in Navan, and in Louth it is in Dundalk.  However, Drogheda, which is the biggest town, does not currently have the necessary local government decision making infrastructure.<\/p><p>When we talk about Navan, Tralee, Wexford or places like Sligo each and every one of them is smaller than Drogheda but they all have something that Drogheda does not have.  They have a local based county council, a decision-making body which is in the centre and heart of their community.  We do not have that in Drogheda where we do not have a council or a borough council.  It was done away with in the past and I believe that it must come back.  I know that there are plans for changes in our local government reform, and hand-in-hand with our national planning framework changes there must be increased capacity of local government and changes in local government to allow decision-making locations like Drogheda become true and proper administrative cities where they can do their business.<\/p> <p> I believe the whole community in the Drogheda and in the greater Drogheda area are behind this plan.  Our business people and all our political parties are signing up to the proposal that Drogheda must be part of this plan.  I welcome the fact that the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, of which I am a member, today agreed to recommend to the Minister that Drogheda would be included, either as part of a linear city with Dundalk and Newry or as a stand-alone separate city.<\/p> <p> I am glad the Minister of State is in the Chamber and is listening to what we are saying.  Bad planning has been responsible for the appalling planning mess in which east Meath ended up.  Good planning would bring east Meath and Drogheda and south Louth together in a new, decisive city that could serve all of the people in the area very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600027#BB00300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509022800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on the national planning framework.  For many years I have called for a significant re-evaluation of the status currently assigned to the town and environs of Clonmel under the then national spatial strategy.  We were ignored.  I want to salute the members of Tipperary County Council planning department who engineered a significant review of the 2002-2020 national spatial strategy as part of their efforts to upgrade the importance of the town on a national level as far back as 2014 when the consultation process for the national planning framework had only begun.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear at this point that Clonmel is suffering from what is essentially a failure to recognise the true regional and national importance of the town.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is not too far away from it in the south east and he knows the areas himself.  It is a proud town and a good town and we kept Cromwell out of it.  We were under siege for ten days but we kept them out.  We could not, however, keep big Phil out.  The former Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, or the enforcer as I call him, destroyed our town council, took it away and vanished it.<\/p>  <p>  Under the then national spatial strategy Clonmel was still designated as a county town when in reality it outperforms many of the designated higher order centres in terms of key socio-economic strengths and the potential to build on existing opportunities.  Clonmel may not have met the criteria but it is well qualified.  We were sadly abandoned by the spatial strategy.  That is not acceptable.  It is a gateway.<\/p>  <p>  We have now been let down again because we recently gave a proposal to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to connect with the M24.  The Taoiseach and the Minister have announced the M24 route, prematurely I believe as the national development plan is not due until December.  The Government has also announced the road from Limerick to Cork.  We want it to come from Limerick to Cahir.  We have a motorway from Cahir to Cork and Dublin, which is under-utilised.  The road could continue to Clonmel, the land is earmarked for this road and it is designed.  It could bypass Mooncoin in County Kilkenny, which is an awful place for traffic, and Carrick-On-Suir, and go right on to Waterford.  It is about connectivity of Galway to Foynes in Limerick and the ports of Cork, Rosslare and Waterford.  Anyone with a brain in their head could see the strategic impact of this proposal.  It would save &euro;380 million, being cheaper than the Limerick to Cork motorway.  I have no objection to the Limerick to Cork M20 going ahead as it is needed also, but if we could save &euro;380 million many other infrastructure projects could have been developed.  It would be joined up thinking.  In the context of Brexit the ports in Rosslare and Waterford become more important.  I do not know if it was political but the Minister announced it anyway, even though there is only &euro;15 million available this year to do the design.  What was the point of announcing it?  We could have saved &euro;380 million.  I often criticise him but in fairness to the Tipperary County Council CEO Joe McGrath, he and his engineers designed it and brought it to Government.  It is a very good plan but it should have been given more thought and the two motorways could have been done together, in tandem if necessary.  I am not anti the Cork road at all but this was an obvious link right through from the west down to the south east.  It would create connectivity from Waterford to Dublin also, for tourism and for business, and especially with the impact of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  As such the existing designation is hampering our ability to become far more actively embedded in policy decisions that can create enhanced, globally competitive and dynamic economic conditions.  These goals are, after all, the explicit aims of the national planning framework, or so we are told - one would wonder when we see what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to see practical policy measures designed to encourage more balanced regional development.  By any standard Clonmel is a significant regional player and that is why we need an urgent reassessment, which not only better reflects that reality but which also takes seriously Clonmel's central position at the heart of the recently defined southern region.  This is very important.  We had a meeting here recently about a south east university, attended also by the Minister of State.  Clonmel was always the biggest inland town in the State.  There are arguments now that other towns such as Drogheda and Athlone might try to outstretch us, but I do not believe they will.<\/p>  <p>  We have strengths in Clonmel such as a strong research and innovation capacity and the availability of essential strategic infrastructure.  I shall salute this foreign direct investment such as Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme, Boston Scientific and Abbott Ireland Vascular Division.  Clonmel Healthcare is vacant currently but hopefully it will get going again.  We are very big in the pharma industry and I thank those companies for giving a commitment to Clonmel and the staff they have.  I will fight my corner any day regarding corporation tax.  They must be kept because of the jobs involved, the suppliers that supply them and all the taxes they pay.  It is worth a fortune to our region and to the State.<\/p>  <p>  It is my wish that many of the concerns emerging from a rural perspective would make their way into a reconsideration of the national planning framework.  We have to do this, otherwise it is being rushed.  During the debate on our motion last week with regard to Cork city taking over the county, and other counties are suffering the same, including our council amalgamation in Tipperary, I had said that the national planning framework cannot afford to become a source of uncertainty about rural rejuvenation.  We have enough of that from other areas without it being embedded in this key document.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies, including the previous speaker, Deputy O'Dowd, have spoken about Drogheda and the proud role of Drogheda borough council and Clonmel.  There were 11 such councils that were banished at the stroke of a pen by the then Minister, Phil Hogan.  I am supporting Former Local Authorities &Eacute;ire, FLAME with its legal action regarding the abolition of these councils.  We were told in the programme for Government that there would be a commitment to a plebiscite to reintroduce borough or town councils, provided that people wanted them and there was no cost to the State.  We have no problem with that.  The members who have served on Clonmel borough council, and many other borough councils over the decades, were not in it for the money.  They were in it for the betterment of their towns, for tourism, for families, for housing and for everything else.  They were active.  I salute them and compliment them for their work over the years.  We had a proud record in Clonmel, Cashel, Carrick-On-Suir, Durlas &Eacute;ile, Templemore, Tipperary town and Nenagh.  They all had their own councils and they were just banished.  It is a big loss because decision making is thwarted and people have been shut out from democracy.  That must not happen in this national planning framework.<\/p>  <p>  We must think of rural Ireland.  Lip-service is no good.  Dublin is jammers.  We walk out the front door here and we see cranes everywhere and the Ceann Comhairle has just informed Members, after a meeting with the Captain of the House, that we will have a crane in the grounds of Leinster House when we return after Hallowe'en.  Dublin is alive and well.  It is vibrant with building.  It is not houses: it is all offices, which I also welcome because we need offices and companies coming in to the country post-Brexit.  We also need some semblance of recognition that it is not all about Dublin.  The most recent survey on OECD economic activity is that 52% of our economic activity is in Dublin.  Yet, one cannot get a place to stay.  There is no room for the homeless and there are social problems that come with that.  We need something fair.  We are not begging.  We are entitled to our fair share.  Tipperary is a proud county and we want Clonmel in the first instance and all the towns I have mentioned, including Cahir which never had a council and which is a gem in the eye and a wonderful tourism spot, to be supported.<\/p><p>I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, told me earlier that he has agreed to come down and visit Cahir Castle and Swiss Cottage.  We want to show off what we have.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, might come down to see it too.  I do not know if he has ever been down with us.  Beidh fiche f&aacute;ilte roimh.  He would be welcome.<\/p> <p> We do not have a begging bowl out, we are a proud country that simply wants due recognition of what we have and support for our amenities and facilities.  We want due support for the local authority and a fair crack of the whip on roads funding and other infrastructure investment.  We have not been getting that for a long time now but we are entitled to it.  We are not going to shut up and go away with a sop, as one might throw a fist of hay to a hungry horse.  We are here to stay and will reassert ourselves in Tipperary.  We will have the town councils back, running them voluntarily if the Government will not agree to it.  We want a fair bang for our buck as regards rates collected, property tax and taxes paid.<\/p> <p> We welcome the foreign direct investment companies, including those up the road in Cashel and across the border in Dungarvan.  They are all pharmaceutical and we are the captains of that industry, even if the Ceann Comhairle might not agree.  I make that claim here today and salute those companies for their longevity.  Merck has been there for more than 40 years and the other companies have been there for a long time also.  We want to keep and enhance them and we want the proper infrastructure to support them.  We want traffic management plans and road designs put in place.  We also have a proud equine industry.  Although I might be critical of it in some ways, I am very proud of it.  The Members opposite might have a flutter on our horses at the weekends.  In fact, they have the chance to have several flutters on several of them given the number of horses Tipperary provides.<\/p> <p> We demand due recognition in the national framework plan, which cannot be rushed.  It should go back to the drawing board to look after those people speaking for other rural areas.  Rural Ireland is stagnating and we are not going to stand idly by and let it die.  I could quote a former Taoiseach who said something along those lines about something in the North.  I am elected by the people to fight for Tipperary.  We will fight and ensure we get due recognition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600028#CC00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509023400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>No one would be foolish enough to think Deputy McGrath was going to shut up and go away anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600029#DD00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1509023400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>He forgot about the motorways going north, east and west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600029#DD00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1509023400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta Mattie McGrath faoi choinne an cuireadh go dt&iacute; Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.

Border communities, including those in my own county of Donegal, are a key concern of the framework.  I acknowledge the input of officials in the Department and of all local authorities along the Border who looked at this in terms of a vision and in terms of the practical and pragmatic approach to joining up infrastructure, including roads, broadband, education and health infrastructure.  The Government is anxious to ensure that every aspect of the framework is fully Brexit-proofed to protect these communities and to help maintain peace and stability on the island.<\/p>  <p>  With the peace process, barriers came down.  We have all seen the huge benefits of that.  Nevertheless, Brexit continues to raise concerns.  After the Good Friday Agreement, cross-Border contacts that had been lost for generations returned.  Freedom of movement of both people and goods has increased massively since the removal of checkpoints and the reopening of roads.  Lives saved since the ending of violence translated to lives saved by the sharing of health care services such as the coronary and cancer care units at Altnagelvin in Derry towards which Irish taxpayers contributed upwards of &euro;20 million to guarantee 30% bed provision for patients from County Donegal with regard to breast care.  The Government supports the work of Donegal Country Council and of Derry City and Strabane District Council to create jobs on both sides of the Border.  Infrastructure is vital for the north west and the Border region and the development of the A5 is the key regional priority.  As the Taoiseach said recently in Derry, there is no point in just doing the A5 if we do not also include the road connections into and within Donegal, including the connections from Lifford to Letterkenny and Lifford to Sligo, with bypasses of Stranorlar and Ballybofey.  With such infrastructure will come more investment in our region and more prosperity for all our citizens, developing our country and the island as a whole in a planned, structured and visionary way.  That is what the national planning framework is all about.<\/p>  <p>  There are still many unknowns about Brexit but we cannot allow the return of anything which prevents the free movement of goods and people across the Border.  As many people in the Derry region have pointed out recently, in particular from the Foyle Port, they will not allow their businesses or their future to be defined by Brexit.  We are building more bridges in education.  It makes sense for our third level institutions to work together with Letterkenny IT, Ulster University at the Magee campus, and the North West Regional College collaborating across the Border.  This is something I want to see happen into the future.  In just over 20 years, there will be another million people on our island and we must start planning for that now.  The national planning framework and capital plan are the blueprints for 8 million people living on this island by 2040.  Future connections, North and South, must be taken into consideration to build a sustainable health, education, transport and economic society on the island.<\/p>  <p>  Following months of public consultation, detailed discussion before the Oireachtas housing committee and extensive debate in the Chamber today, the national planning framework will allow the Government to set out a vision for the planned and structured development of the nation in the critical two decades ahead.  The past can sometimes be used to define or set the parameters of where we will be in future.  Past performance is sometimes used as an indicator of future performance.  We had a national spatial strategy, some parts of which worked, but there is always ongoing criticism of reports and templates that they became a big noise on announcement day with the practical implementation and follow-up being suspect.  A vacuum may be identified in the aftermath.  There has been extensive public consultation and we are having this cross-party debate in the House.  All of us are constituency representatives and we are all thinking of projects in our own constituencies.  This document, however, must go wider than that and consider where people will be living and working in future, as well as the changing nature of work.<\/p>  <p>  For example, we have more than 2,000 companies in the financial services sector in County Donegal.  A lot of that work can be done remotely.  We have a national broadband plan and people will be able to work from home.  There are people from my county working in places like Singapore, New York and Dublin who will decide, if the proper infrastructure is in place, that it is time to move back.  The missing piece of the roads infrastructure jigsaw on the map of the island of Ireland is the lack of access to the north west.  We have great infrastructure up the M1 from Dublin Port Tunnel.  We must maintain a focus on the N2 right into Monaghan and on the A5.  With the help of a pragmatic approach and the making of the right decisions over the next few months, work on the A5 will start.  We must then look at joining up the other bits.<\/p>  <p>  My county has been in economic and political isolation for too many decades.  We are enjoying a new positivity because of the Wild Atlantic Way.  I meet people from the Ceann Comhairle's native county of Kildare, for example, who tell me it is their first time in Donegal and that it is a beautiful county.  There were obvious reasons people did not go to Donegal in the past.  We have moved on from that.  We are building on the positivity and the Wild Atlantic Way.  We are building on a new wave of job creation in industry that was previously restricted to a small part of our region.  We know that we cannot do it in isolation as a county in future.  We will continue to work with our neighbours in the Derry-Strabane council.  They have a joint appreciation that Derry city is the driver and engine not only of Derry and Strabane but of the region generally, which has a population, if one includes counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, of approximately 500,000.<\/p><p> Future services will be dependent on critical mass and we have that in the region.  If we continue to use a line on the map as the determining factor for future service provision, we will repeat the mistakes of the past.  We have a wonderful opportunity in the times in which we live.  We have peace, which is still fragile, and prosperity but it is still a better place than before.  Now it is about a peace dividend, which means jobs and investment in order that people see a result.  The way to develop the region is to build the critical infrastructure and that is why I will continue to emphasise the importance of Derry city being a key component of this framework.<\/p> <p> I appreciate that other plans considered towns, critical mass and different gateways and hubs.  They used a different language but we have a city driving the development of Donegal.  There is urban sprawl into east Donegal.  A total of 30% of the labour force in Seagate in Derry comes from my county, while 25% of the employees in the Foyle port company come from Donegal.  It works the other way as well.  Up to 15% of the staff in Pramerica in Letterkenny, whom the Minister of State has met, come from across the Border.  There is a natural movement of people, which began decades ago.  However, following political partition, economic isolation and neglect and political neglect down the decades, we have to face up to the reality that there is a region that has produced the blueprint for the future.  The work that Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council have done can provide the fundamental cornerstone for a better region and better way of life to attract people home and to provide solutions for the gridlock in Dublin.  If the A5 is upgraded, someone could leave Dublin via the Port Tunnel and travel along the N2 and A5 to Letterkenny in two and a half hours.  The critical message is we can provide a solution in the north west for much of the gridlock in this city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600029#DD00600","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509024000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Planning is fundamental to how we develop our island as we move forward.  First, we must examine how Ireland has developed over the past 25 to 30 years, with continuing urbanisation and development on the east coast, in particular, in recent times.  We then have to consider our natural resources in rural Ireland and how they are integrated into planning and the greater scheme of development.  One of the most fundamental difficulties is it is becoming almost impossible for young people who have gone to college and worked in urban centres such as Dublin Cork, New York and Sydney and who want to return to where they are from and where their family is based  to build a house in rural Ireland because of the planning restrictions on one-off houses.  If the site is at the outskirts of a village, they could face charges of up to &euro;20,000 for connections to water and sewerage schemes and development contributions.  That does not encourage people to live in these communities, which have a basic infrastructure.  By and large, they have excellent primary schools and excellent secondary schools, which have served the population for almost 50 years since the late 1960s and have done an impeccable job.  There is a great social infrastructure comprising sporting and other facilities.  There are, however, connectivity issues, primarily relating to broadband, which is as important to rural communities now as the ESB was in the 1940s and 1950s and the telephone in the 1970s and 1980s.<\/p>  <p>  There is a direct contradiction in the framework document between what the authors perceive should be available and an emotional tie to the area being no longer acceptable when granting planning permission.  It is beyond credibility that people can sit in an office, whether is in Cork, Dublin or Brussels, and say that housing can no longer be sustained in these communities.  I recall an appearance by An Taisce representatives at a meeting of the environment committee in 2000 at which they outlined all the reasons planning permission should not be granted for one-off houses.  They said everything should be built in urban settings or on the outskirts of towns and villages.  Planning permission was then granted for huge developments on the outskirts of towns and villages, for which there was no demand whatsoever, between 2004 and 2007.  This was the new planning regime, which resulted in ghost estates all over the place.  Significant pressure was put on county councils to grant permission for one-off houses to people who were from the area and had bought sites or who were working in the area and had kids going to school there.  They had to build up a raft of documentation as the planning application when through the system.  As one-off houses were built and the people who lived in them had families, they became embedded in their communities and they have contributed extremely well to them, whereas the those living on the estates that have been built at the edges of towns and villages are isolated and segregated from their communities.  There is no proper integration whatsoever.  It is the same as when west Dublin and Ballymun were developed and slums in Dublin city were cleared out in the 1960s.<\/p>  <p>  We are creating issues for the future and the nonsense in this document about one-off housing is absolutely crazy.  I do not know what the bureaucrats and An Taisce and the other fine bodies are thinking because they are not connected to rural communities.  If we were to have a serious chat with ourselves, we would have to make it more acceptable to grant planning permission for such houses and we would have to make it easier for couples to secure permission and to integrate with communities.  If we go down the economic route and say that everything has to be based on critical mass and economics in cities, it will be like Dublin.  The city has expanded at an alarming rate and that has hollowed out towns such as Carlow, situated an hour's drive from here, because people are pulled towards Dublin.  Will villages and small towns be hollowed out in County Cork to create a critical mass in Cork city?<\/p>  <p>  There is also a social aspect to planning.  As families grow, grandparents help out and family support is available if there is a crisis.  No path ever runs smooth and help and support is sometimes needed.  I know of families who have moved to Dublin and if one of the children is sick, the grandparents travel up from the country by train in order to help out.  There is no other way because the two parents are working.  That is not sustainable.  The document before us is flawed in its interpretation of what has happened at European level.  It is absolutely flawed to think that we cannot have one-off housing.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The treatment plants that are out there are far better than the treatment plants in small towns and villages.  We saw the report earlier this week in terms of the pollution that has been caused.  They are putting down their own wells and are not a burden on the State in any way, shape or form.  It is almost as if we have to close down every village and national school and move on.  However, in 50 years' time, whoever will be here will be debating why this policy was pursued and the thinking behind it.<\/p> <p> We have seen in the marginal parts of this country that land and community abandonment are real factors.  Two hours were allowed for this debate, which is as fundamental as the debate on the Finance Bill or any other issue being debated in this House at this time.  It is fundamental to how we will order our society over the next 25 years or 30 years.  The policies that have been pursued by environmentalists, those in the Custom House and others in terms of centralising the population is not working and is bad for society in the long run.  Consider the enormous daily cost to the State associated with the development of Limerick and west Dublin over the past 40 years or 50 years.  If we are to continue with this and say that there is to be no more once-off houses in the country, I firmly believe that we will rue the day and environmentalists, when they will have done a complete about-turn on their nonsensical policies, and planners will come back and say it was a folly.  We are leaving behind a good, integrated social infrastructure.  We will not have all the same age group in the one estate.  We will have people of all age groups, as well as help, support and commitment, which is how the community should be defined.  Communities should be defined in terms of how they support their people.<\/p> <p> In whatever we do and in terms of our contributions to this debate, we have to appreciate and support what we have.  We must encourage people because people will live in rural parts of Ireland.  I said last night during the debate on the Finance Bill that there are many fine jobs in rural parts of Ireland.  Small and large companies have built up significant employment and given social cohesion to communities.  That is readily available if the people who are extremely well-educated by our education system are encouraged in some small way and the blocks are taken away and they are helped to build their own houses, rather than having the absolute nonsense and bureaucratic bullshit that is going on at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600030#EE00200","speaker":"1283","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509024600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>The language, a Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600031#FF00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1509024600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>An Teachta Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, le do thoil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600031#FF00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1509024600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Rural parts of Ireland are in serious trouble.  In many ways, we have a two-tier economy and society.  We have been rudderless since 2002 without a spatial plan.  Most of the economic activity is concentrating on the mid-east and greater Dublin region.  Comparatively speaking, Dublin's dominance is significantly out of kilter.  Its dominance economically and population-wise would be three or four times the dominance of London in Britain, for example.  There is a significant danger that we are moving towards a city state, where more than 50% of the economic activity, taxes paid and population will be located in a small area.  That city state will be surrounded by a national park of emptiness where, except for a few small perhaps regionally important urban areas, there will be no driving energy or critical mass to re-balance that lack of kilter.  There will be no critical mass for cities to be able to attract investment or compete on an international basis.  That is what has been missing from Government policy over the past number of years.<\/p>  <p>  Teagasc has carried out research and identified that currently, only 37% of farmers in this State are independently economically viable.  That is phenomenal.  There are only approximately 140,000 farmers in the State and only a small cohort of them are making enough money to feed their family and pay their way themselves.  We also have a major problem with energy in this country but we have not yet put the two issues together.  For example, the importation every year by Bord na M&oacute;na of biomass worth millions of euro that could be produced here is a major mistake.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, has not produced a feed-in tariff yet for farmers in rural parts of Ireland to produce small-scale solar, wind or bio-digesters and put energy into the system, reduce exports of fossil fuels and add money into their own pockets.  It is unbelievable how slow the Government is.  Most European countries did this ages ago.  If up in the North four of five years ago, one would have seen solar panels on the roofs of houses that were feeding into the system and allowing people to contribute.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600031#FF00400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1509024600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>It did not work particularly well in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600031#FF00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1509024600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>The feed-in tariffs allowed people to bring energy into the system in the North of Ireland, but the Minister of State is right in that there has been corruption in the North with regard to the renewable heating scheme, which is why we have taken that issue so seriously.<\/p><p>The spatial imbalance has been added to by the Government's onslaught on services in regional and rural parts of Ireland, with 500 post offices now being described as economically unsustainable and with the closure of 139 Garda stations.  I met the regulator of the credit unions, which are being prevented from functioning as a growing banking system in this economy.  The Government is involved in a whole range of brakes on the development of rural parts of Ireland.  For instance, in parts of the country broadband speeds are 36 times slower than those in parts of Dublin.  If anyone is looking to do any business these days, they need broadband.  However, we will not have broadband in many of these places until 2022 or 2023.  The Government needs to get interim solutions to those broadband crises as well.  <\/p><p>One of my major problems with the Government's focus on regional and rural development is the ignoring of the Six Counties.  The Border runs for 499 km in mostly rural parts of Ireland but there is little mention of the North of Ireland in the strategic plans of this Government.  The same applies with regard to the South of Ireland in the North's plans.  In that area, the development of 11 counties is enmeshed.  They are interdependent and that needs to be focused on.  <\/p><p>IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have a really poor record in the development of jobs outside of Dublin.  Since Fine Gael came into office, at least 70% of IDA Ireland investment has gone to the Dublin or Cork areas.  Those statistics belie any shaking of heads.  More is going in now due to the super-inflation that exists in Dublin with regard to office space and accommodation space.  It is more out of default that this is happening.  This critique is not to say that Dublin does not need development.  Of course it needs development, but the Government's rudderless spatial plan so far has led to overheating in areas of Dublin.<\/p><p>Two important things need to happen.  Representatives of the NTA attended my committee recently and I asked them the basis on which they invested in transport services.  They said that they invest on the basis of demand, which sounds logical.  Demand needs to be met.  However, we are not going to change the spatial imbalance in the country by focusing on demand only.  If we want to disrupt the trends, when investing we must have regard to future demands and not just existing demand.  In other words, if we want to build a critical mass that will create balance and draw from Dublin, we need to invest more <i>per capita<\/i>in certain locations in the State but that has not happened.  <\/p><p>County Meath is a great county but it has suffered significantly due to the lack of spatial planning over the past 20 years.  It has basically become a dormitory county with a population that is increasing rapidly.<\/p><p>The number of people living in the county will increase from 200,000 to approximately 250,000 within 20 years.  This increase is creating severe pressure on housing.  There are approximately 4,000 people on the housing waiting list in County Meath, yet there are approximately 5,000 empty houses in the county.  Despite rents increasing at one of the fastest rates in the country, rent caps have not been applied to any part of my constituency of Meath West.<br\/><br\/>County Meath has a disproportionately young population, with an average age lower than the national average.  Funding for youth services is poor, however, with the county receiving only &euro;2.89 per child from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, as opposed to an average national payment of &euro;22.31 per child.  Meath County Council has the lowest income, expenditure and number of staff <i>per capita <\/i>of all local authorities.  Until the Government commits to providing the county council with the resources required to bring its funding up to the national average, the county will continue to have major problems. <br\/><br\/>To give another example of the role of Departments run by Fine Gael Ministers, the average payment nationally from private housing grants is &euro;8 <i>per capita<\/i>, whereas the corresponding figure in County Meath is &euro;3 <i>per capita<\/i>and the highest average payment in the country is &euro;17 <i>per capita<\/i>.  County Meath has the lowest number of garda&iacute; <i>per capita<\/i>in the State, which is one of the reasons we have a spate of crime in the county and its major towns have daytime drug dealing and drug use in their centres.  Approximately 40% of the population of the county shop elsewhere.  This is one of the highest figures for retail leakage in the country.  County Meath is also a net contributor to the State, providing 3.4% of taxes and receiving only 2.7% of expenditure.  It is also the most heavily tolled county in the State.<br\/><br\/>One of the reasons for all of this is that County Meath, like County Kildare, has a burgeoning population and Government spending is not keeping pace with population growth.  While Kildare, Louth and Wicklow are comparable counties, they attract much more investment through IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland than County Meath.  As a result, economic stability in the county has declined significantly in recent years and it has fallen down the affluence table. <br\/><br\/>People in County Meath, with its large population, commute further than people in any other county owing to a lack of jobs and transport infrastructure locally.  This morning, the majority of people in the county who went to work left the county.  In no other local authority area in the State do most workers leave the county to work.<br\/><br\/>The Government must, in its spatial strategy, not only balance east and west and disrupt current trends, but also ensure counties such as Meath are not left behind in terms of investment.  The Government's plans do not envisage a rail line to Navan, the largest town in the country without a rail service.  Navan is also in the county with the largest number of commuters who also commute further than people in all other counties.  People travelling into Dublin meet traffic jams on the Meath side of the Dublin-Meath border and as far west as four, five or six miles outside Blanchardstown.  This is because Fine Gael made a decision to reduce capital expenditure.  Ireland is second from the bottom of the European Union league table for capital expenditure, spending more than only Romania. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600031#FF00600","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509025200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>It is interesting to hear Deputies outline the different perspectives from various counties.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Joe McHugh, argued, we must address overdevelopment on the east coast.  In doing so, we must not overlook the issues raised by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  The national planning framework must get to grips with the commitments in the programme for Government in respect of the Atlantic economic corridor.  This corridor, which is a counterbalance to overdevelopment in Dublin, links Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Derry and aims to create a critical mass that will enable the region to attract industries and jobs and keep people in their homes and parishes.  The Atlantic economic corridor concept requires significant investment if this goal, which is supported by the chambers of commerce in all of the counties in the region, is to be achieved.  Our approach to development must be regional rather than parochial and focused on developing the entire regain, rather than sections of it.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that major strides have been made in developing the west.  These include the opening of the stretch of the M17-M18 motorway between Gort to Tuam.  However, no one should think this is the end of the story.  We must continue this type of infrastructure-led development.  An example of this type of development that I often cite is Knock Airport.  When the late Monsignor Horan spoke about building an airport at Knock, he was ridiculed.  The airport is now a vital part of the west's infrastructure, providing access to the region for more than 1 million airline passengers every year.  However, further development is required in the region, including improvements in the road network northwards into counties Donegal and Derry.  The western rail corridor must also be extended to provide a proper rail corridor in the west serving the ports of Foynes, Cork and Galway.  Foynes Port is being developed with an investment of &euro;40 million but this will not solve anything in isolation.  We need to create connectivity. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to building metro north, we should extend the rail network into Shannon and Knock airports in order that passengers arriving at these airports have access to a rail service that will transport them to their final destination. <\/p>  <p>  The west has a significant broadband deficit which the Government is addressing in a slow and difficult process.  Without broadband, the west will not make progress.<\/p>  <p>  The west offers significant opportunities to develop sources of alternative energy.  The marine resource must be harnessed along the length of the Atlantic coast.  This could be achieved with a proper plan and blueprint.  The Atlantic economic corridor is the blueprint for solving many of the problems Deputies raised when they likened motorways to car parks and spoke of congestion and hollowed out towns and counties surrounding the capital.  We need to create a counterbalance to Dublin and I hope the Atlantic economic corridor will become the main focus in the national planning framework.<\/p>  <p>  Wastewater is another area of deficiency.  Many of the housing estates built in east Galway in the past 20 years have private wastewater treatment schemes, which no one is prepared to take in charge or assess.  Despite this, we are unable to provide municipal treatment plants to replace them.  We need to take a different approach to this issue by examining the idea of establishing co-operatives in villages that would link housing estates to a single wastewater treatment plant.  We need to take an innovative, smart approach rather than continuing as we have always done. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the implementation of the national planning framework.  We must ensure it is focused on regional development, rather than allowing it to be concentrated on cities.  If we do this properly, we will set a template which we can be proud of in 20 or 30 years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600032#GG00200","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1509025200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>We have to consider some facts.  Some 2.7 million of the State's population of 4.7 million live in Leinster and the move towards the east coast has been astonishing.  I drove from Wexford to Dublin this morning.  The Ceann Comhairle is from a county adjacent to Dublin and my neck of the woods is also close to the capital.<\/p><p>A person from my locality needs to be on the motorway at 6.05 a.m. in order to get to Dublin - 60 miles away - for 7.45 a.m.  That is the length of time it is taking because of the volume of traffic.  We cannot keep having people driving into Dublin city because it is unable to accommodate that number of cars.<\/p> <p> I wish to place on record the fact that, since I became Minister of State with responsibility for financial services, I have promoted rural and regional Ireland every time I meet the representatives of companies.  I tell companies that there is a terrific service and product available outside Dublin.  While companies have different views and criteria, they are now looking outside Dublin in a much more positive way than was the case in the past.  I have used Pramerica in Letterkenny as a really good example in this regard.  Letterkenny is a medium-sized town of 20,000 people but it has Pramerica, a company with a staff of 1,500, and another company, Optimus, which has a staff of 1,000.  There are 2,500 employees in the financial services sector in a medium-sized town and there is the capacity and ability to continue that service.  It is very important that we continue to promote rural and regional Ireland.<\/p> <p> The construction of the M20 is crucial.  We must link Limerick and Cork.  This will be the first time that we link two cities for quite some time.  In every other instance where such a link was being created, it involved Dublin city and some other location.  This is the first time Limerick and Cork will be linked by a motorway.<\/p> <p> It galls me somewhat when people in this House say that rural Ireland is dead.  Rural Ireland is not dead.  There are some areas that are experiencing depopulation and other challenges but other areas are thriving.  Letterkenny is the best example.  It is a thriving medium-sized rural town four hours from here.  There are many Letterkennys all over the country, including Gorey, the town in which I live.  Gorey is thriving.  It has a massive retail centre and a population of 10,000.  Rural Ireland is not dead but we must ensure that there are sufficient economic growth centres in every county or region so that the spin-off from these will help the areas that are falling backwards.  Killorglin is a small town in County Kerry with a population of fewer than 5,000.  A company called FEXCO, which employs 1,000 staff, is located there.  That is the future.  It involves attracting companies that are large enough to have a huge impact on a region and I am committed to ensuring that this happens.<\/p> <p> The challenge for Kildare, Meath, about which Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke, and where I live in north County Wexford is ensuring that the capital does not become all-consuming, thereby obliging the people in the areas to which I refer all have to work in Dublin.  They do not have to do so.  People can commute in the opposite direction rather than all driving their cars into the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600032#GG00300","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509025800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I fully support putting in place a national planning strategy with which counties and regions must comply.  As has been mentioned already, the way planning has gone in County Meath over the past 20 or 30 years has been nothing short of outrageous.  Some people lobbied on behalf of towns to try to expand them in order that they reach their full potential, as I heard one person say in respect of a particular village.  What has happened in Meath is that we now have wonderful towns.  However, very few of the new towns in the Meath East constituency are of sufficient size to ensure that one can have all of the necessary facilities in place.  If Meath County Council wanted to put a swimming pool somewhere in the area comprising Ashbourne, Ratoath, Dunshauglin and Dunboyne, there is no one town that can say it has the population to sustain it.  It must be shared between the various towns because they have been allowed to grow near enough to each other and, in some cases, at similar rates.  We must call a halt to this.  As the Minister of State said with regard to commuting times, commuting times just keep going up and people are suffering much more hassle on the roads every day when travelling to Dublin from my constituency.  Not enough jobs are being located in the suburbs.  In some cases, we will have to upgrade roads.  We certainly have to upgrade the N2 for safety reasons and because it just cannot hold the traffic that is already there.  There is no question about that.  However, if planning is continue the way it has operated in County Meath over many years, it simply will not be sustainable.  We will not be able to deliver the jobs, services or transport infrastructure people want.  We really have to call a halt in respect of what has gone on up to now.<\/p>  <p>  My biggest issue with any kind of planning strategy or framework is that the public needs to be involved from day one because, generally, the public was not on board with the vast majority of development plans or the expansion of towns, villages and seaside resorts that occurred in the past 20 or 25 years.  Effectively, members of the public were left out of the loop.  I saw a recent example of this two years ago when a footnote appeared in one particular variation of a development plan to state that it was envisaged that Stamullen might increase in size to become a moderately sustainable town.  In other words, it might grow to three times its size.  This was simply a footnote in a variation of a development plan.  That would not have the effect of doing that.  The residents did not know that this was being planned for their area.  This needs to stop and we must involve not just the D&aacute;il but also all the people in our communities, right down to the grass roots, in what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  In light of what is contained in planning framework, some of the development in my constituency will have to be brought to a halt if the framework is to succeed.  I do not know if the message will get through to county councils, councillors and other interested parties that, put simply, some towns will remain as they are - and that this would be in the best interests of planning for those towns and the region - while others will expand massively.  I think that will have to happen as well but as long as the public is involved, it may not be a problem.  If members of the public are confident that transport, infrastructure and other services will be delivered, then they will come on board.<\/p>  <p>  This demands a new realisation.  We must view this from a national perspective.  There is no point in Meath County Council deciding that Stamullen needs to expand massively - and not informing the residents of the town - while Balbriggan, which is almost next door, is on some different track or path.  That cannot be allowed to happen any more.  It must be done nationally and regionally and I will support that all the way because we need services, roads, infrastructure, broadband and sports fields.  These are ongoing issues affecting all of the towns and villages in my constituency, in which there is a severe lack of services and facilities because of the amount of housing that is being built.  We need to stop this approach to planning.  Planning must be strategic in nature and it must proceed on the basis of catering for communities rather than just involving the construction of housing.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd spoke about Drogheda, which is an interesting case because it is like many towns situated on the borders of counties.  I will not blame the Minister of State, Deputy English, for this because he was not really on board with it at all but the previous Government proposed a change in the boundary between Louth and Meath.  That was a simple change which meant absolutely nothing in terms of forward planning for the entire region.  A lot more could be done through co-operation between counties.  Two counties with a town on the border between them should be made to work much closely to develop strategies for that town.  I hope that under the national planning framework and the regionalisation of planning, this would be essential so that one county will not be able to do something on one side without the active involvement of the adjoining county for the good of all citizens of the region.<\/p>  <p>  In truth, we are catching up following the bad planning of the past.  Many things that County Meath needs will be required regardless of whether we expand so we need the upgrade of the N2 to make it safer.  We think of the person who died this week but quite a number of people have died on that road this year.  Action is required in respect of N2 but this must reflect the needs of commuters who experience continuous delays on the road.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for the Navan rail line to service Dunshaughlin.  There is also a need for those responsible for planning public transport and rail lines to actually use rail and bus transport in order that they might know what they are talking about.<\/p><p>The station originally proposed for Dunshaughlin was somewhere way outside the town, which would be absolutely useless to anybody.  We have to get a realistic plan back on track.  We also have to look at how we can serve Ratoath or Ashbourne with that rail line leading down to Dunboyne and back into the city. <br\/><br\/>The truth is a lot of people like to live beside capital cities and a lot of companies like to move and employ people beside or in capital cities.  It is a reality that is reflected in the plan because it provides for a substantial increase in population in the mid-east region.  It is right that the plan also seeks to disperse population around the country.  That is essential.  We are facing a huge increase, even in the mid-east and even with this national plan.  It must be done properly.  It must be done with communities in mind and with the consent of the public on the ground.  I urge county councils and regional authorities, when this starts filtering down - and it needs to filter down as soon as possible when the plan is complete - to involve communities and get their consent.  The Government should make it a key priority of the national planning framework that the public is on board and involved all the time.  <br\/><br\/>We also need to consider an issue that many of my colleagues have raised.  There is a lot of concern about rural areas and how they could lose out.  We are not a completely urbanised society.  We are to some extent but there are rural populations and towns that need to see the benefit of development.  Deputy Michael Moynihan was very critical of the plan.  I imagine people in Cork North-West would only be too delighted for a bit of development.  We should think carefully about it and do it properly.  I am sure they would like to do it properly and carefully too in Cork North-West.  Rural areas want development.  There are rural areas in my constituency that need some sort of help in terms of planning.  I do not want to see the whole concept of rural houses stopped by this plan.  There is certainly language in the plan that causes worry to planners.  There must also be scope for allowing people to build one-off houses on the edge of villages.  It needs to be looked at more closely because it makes sense for everybody.  It makes sense for the people who want to live in a rural area but it also makes sense that the village would be able to incorporate these people and the services would be easy to avail of.  It is something we have not looked at.  We have the grade system that was in vogue a few years ago.  We need to bring it back and encourage more rural houses - if people from such areas want to build them - around our villages and integrate them into the villages as best we can while not stopping people building on their own family land.  That is a fundamental principle that must be maintained.  <br\/><br\/>People do not need to build absolutely massive houses in rural areas.  Some people build very big houses and that is their entitlement once it is in accordance with the planning and development plan.  Other people want to build smaller houses.  I was talking to a constituent who has moved to the Minister of State's parish.  He has built an average size house, which is very unusual in rural areas at the moment.  It is a really interesting concept because people can expand in the future if they need to.  We need more of that.  There are rural people put off from building in the countryside because there is an expectation that the house must be to a certain size when that may not be needed.  There may be some cases particularly with families where semi-detached houses in rural areas could work really well.  There are lots of examples in the North of Ireland.  We need to encourage it if we are to give people, who may not be able to get a mortgage for very large houses, which have become <i>de rigueur<\/i>in rural Ireland, the opportunity to continue living in their own area.  We must also not forget the rural cottage scheme which is a very useful scheme to keep people in rural areas.  In urban areas we need to keep the planning with the consent of the public, do it properly and put the emphasis on communities and economic development.  We cannot forget rural areas, however.  We need to make sure those rural areas are allowed to thrive and survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600033#HH00200","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509026400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>We all agree regional planning is of the utmost importance.  It has become more and more important as time goes by.  It is true the country has developed in a haphazard way with Dublin spreading out gradually into the country so much that perhaps in 100 years' time it will have spread to the rest of the country.  We have to counter that.  I agree entirely with the people who have already said that.  We can do it in a positive or negative way.  There are some people who say our population is getting too big and that it will increase by a certain amount.  That is to our advantage.  It is beneficial because the more people we have in the country the more economies of scale we can avail of.  Incidentally, in case we need to be reminded, countries such as Belgium and Holland, which are roughly one quarter or one third our size have three and five times the population, which says something about how one can deal with these things.  We have a number of sacred cows we have to confront.  One of the things we have to do is seriously consider investment outside of the greater Dublin area and in close proximity to some of the larger cities, in the midlands and along the western seaboard, right from north to south.  If that is done over a period of time it will eventually level off the kind of development we have seen taking place already.  It will create an economic pull on the other side of the country and we will see an equalisation of development in a way that is beneficial to the people who are living there now and future generations.<\/p>  <p>  Much has been said about rural life.  I have said it many times in the past.  Our planning policy has to look carefully at development in rural Ireland.  Looking at schools is the classic way of finding out where we are going.  Are the schools having difficulty staying open?  Why are they not staying open?  It is because the population is not sufficient to require it.  Why is there not sufficient population to require it?  It is because the local authorities do not want to give planning permission in rural Ireland.  There is no reason in the wide earthly world why we cannot have development of the indigenous rural populations in line with good planning, unlike in the UK where such populations have completely shrunk and moved away.  In the UK, the only people in rural areas, apart from those who live in very big houses, are those in holiday homes.  Such a situation is developing in this country as well.  We need to encourage indigenous populations to remain in their own areas in concert with good planning.  That can be done.  Professor Caulfield in Galway has been promoting the idea for years.  <\/p>  <p>  The dirt and air interpretation of good planning would say it is a great thing to see the side of a hill at night with no lights.  The people who live in that part of the country know the opposite.  They think it is a great thing to see the side of a hill at night with lights.  In every other country in the world that is what one sees.  For some unknown reason, our planners have pursued the opposite line, which means the population drifts away.  We also need to remember that we have a tradition of mass emigration from counties in the midlands, along the western seaboard and the south.  As a result of that there is a need to replenish the population and counter the drift away from those areas.  We could throw up our hands and say we cannot do anything about this but we can.  I will take Carrick-on-Shannon, where 20 years ago there was very little going on, as an example.  I used to visit it occasionally on Sundays and there was very little happening in it.  Two major employers then appeared on the scene, one in the wood fabrication area and the other in the banking area, and it made a huge difference.  One cannot cross the street on a Sunday afternoon now because the traffic is so busy.  There is business, population growth, economic activity, commercial activity and things are happening.  That is what helps to promote and develop an area.  It brings people into the area and it gives people employment and quality of life.  That is just one example.  There needs to be many more such examples along the western seaboard.  I spent a bit of time down there during the summer and in Sligo, Fermanagh and Donegal.  It is interesting to look at now and again.  We all need to do it and we, as legislators, should do it.  <\/p>  <p>  The other thing that has become obvious is the question about infrastructure.  We have choices.  We can have free water.  It is a great ideological idea but if we do that, we will miss out on some other investment in infrastructure.  Water and wastewater services, roads, telecommunications, rail services, recreational facilities and health and education services are the bedrock of the areas of this country that need development.  We must make decisions some time in the future.  It is all very fine to seize political opportunities.  They arise on a regular basis and we go down a particular road for parochial reasons.  That is grand.  It meets a purpose at the time but if we keep going on like that, in 25 years' time we will still be talking about the same things in this House and they will still need to be done. <\/p>  <p>  There were 9 million people in the country in the 1840s.   <\/p><p>The population of the island is at its highest since then.  There have been improvements and positive action has been taken, but more needs to be done.  We need to encourage foreign direct investment and indigenous investment in growth centres along the western seaboard and the midlands.  We need to develop the facilities that are available to develop, as has been done in other parts of Europe and elsewhere.<\/p> <p> We need to be watchful about some of the thinking in Europe regarding what is known now as the Apple tax.  Some countries see a great opportunity of curtailing Ireland's economic activity, but for what reason?  Of course, there is a simple reason.  They want more foreign direct investment in their own bailiwick - in their own backyard.  We are in competition with all of those countries.  It is sad that many people in this country see the so-called Apple tax as a great opportunity for Ireland to get a windfall.  There are no such windfalls around.  The simple fact is that this is a great opportunity for other countries to encourage foreign direct investment into their particular jurisdictions without having to tax anything earned in those jurisdictions and to hand it over to us.  I want to mention this in particular regarding regional development.  If Ireland is forced into that situation, we have a serious problem on our hands.  Some think that is a victory; it is not a victory.  It is a serious issue that will have a huge impact and will curtail our activity, development, growth and advancement for the next 50 years.  Suffice it to say that I do not think it would be a good idea.<\/p> <p> One needs more time than I have to cover a subject of this nature.  If we play our cards well and avail of the opportunities that are available and appear before us, we can take long-term planning decisions that are in the interests of the country at the time they are needed.  We need to avoid quick-flip decisions to gain a short-term advantage and think about the expanding population.  The expanding population should not be seen as a threat and rather should be seen as a great advantage.  There is no reason the country could not facilitate 10 million people.  We have developed this is crazy nonsense over the years.  We draw upon ourselves the notion of being downtrodden and becoming more downtrodden on the basis that if we keep saying the same thing people will have pity for us.  There is no such thing.  We live in a competitive world and we should bear that in mind.<\/p> <p> My last point relates to the things we do ourselves.  While this issue does not affect my constituency, it affects the country.  I know a decision is about to be made either today or within the next week or so on a foreign direct investment project in the Galway region.  Various people objected to it, which is fair enough.  They have a right to object, but it is not a requirement; it is not mandatory to object.  People do not seem to understand the difference.  It is not mandatory.  If we have an opportunity to create jobs in any part of the country, we should have a system that deals with the objections raised much quicker than at present.  We need to be able to illustrate to those considering investment in jobs in the various regions that we can have a decision fairly quickly - at least comparable to the speed of those decisions taken in other jurisdictions that are competing with us.  That is the amazing part of it; they are competing with us.  We would then be able to say that we are working on an even keel and a level playing pitch and be able to compete with anybody.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister will try to put the positives together and avoid the negatives.  We need to try to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes we made in the past and that we do not get involved in a welter of negativity and olag&oacute;n that used to prevail in this country once upon a time.  We have proved during the Celtic tiger that we could do things that were not possible previously.  We may have done things wrong and may have done some daft things, but at least we proved we could do them right if we wanted to.  Let us continue to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600034#JJ00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509027000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I am grateful for this opportunity.  I was starting to worry that we would not have it.  While I am not sure if it was by design, when the draft was published a few weeks ago, there was not a word about it.  There was no national call that I could see to analyse the draft that was published and make sure people made submissions by 3 November.  I am pleased the Government has given us this opportunity.  I submitted a 5,000-word submission.  It is not that I think I have exclusivity on the best way to move forward, but I have suggestions.  It is fair to say that none of those suggestions made their way into the draft plan and I wonder if anybody else's did.  I read all of the available pre-consultative-phase documentation related to the national planning framework.  The draft is remarkably similar.  It makes me feel that it was written already and we are just going through the motions now and will do what we want.<\/p><p>I was involved in the chamber of commerce network in drawing up submissions for the consultation phase of what was then the national spatial strategy.  Of course, the major mistake before we even started was that we got it back to front.  We had the national development plan followed by the national spatial strategy.  At least we are approaching this correctly from a chronological point of view.<\/p><p>I am not encouraged by what I see in the plan.  I know many people spent a considerable amount of time working on it, but I believe it will preserve the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I fear we will do exactly what Deputy Durkan hoped we would not do, meaning that whoever is in these seats in 25 years will again be considering how to deal with the very same problems, except worse, that we are dealing with here today.  This is the exacerbation of the eastern conurbation for want of a better expression, including Deputy Durkan's county and that of Deputy Thomas Byrne, who already highlighted some of the issues here, and ignoring areas where there is capacity.<\/p><p>I often use the following analogy.  If Ireland were a shell and core unit of 10,000 sq. ft., we have only chosen to use and have serviced about 7,000 sq. ft. of it.  Therefore, our output is limited to that space.  Equally, we have done this in a planning context.  With the virtual border that exists north of the Dublin-Galway line and perhaps west of Mullingar, that section of the country, with about 30% of the landmass, about 400,000 people and a great amount of capacity, is largely being ignored.  No party or government since the foundation of the State is without blame in this regard; in fact they all share blame in not taking a strategic approach.  They have regarded the north west of the country as a pain in the national side and thrown it an odd bone of placation from time to time depending on who happened to be influential in their party or in a senior position whereby a project would be undertaken to address a certain road, hospital or school.  There is has been no strategic approach to open up that third of the country.<\/p><p>I am not advocating for the Sligo Olympic bid, nor am I advocating for us to build the Mayo Clinic at every crossroads, but it is foolish in the extreme - sadly, the draft plan does nothing to change my view - that we are choosing to ignore at least 30% of our capacity as we look to the next 20 years.  Huge challenges are there.  All the indications are of a population increase of 600,000 or 700,000 and all the challenges and difficulties that would present.<\/p><p>We need to consider alternatives to preserving the <i>status quo<\/i>.  There are some givens.  Dublin is the national driver and it is vital that it can thrive.  It is bursting at the seams at the moment.  It badly needs its outer orbital route, the metro and numerous other things in order for it to maintain its position and be able to be a national economic driver.  Equally Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway need to be resourced.  Each of these cities has its own challenges at the moment.  Galway is a beautiful place and everybody loves it.  It is thriving and alive, but it is strangled with traffic.  We need to open up that 30% and put the infrastructure in place to allow us to perform to our potential.<\/p><p>To do that, the region needs a driver, and, obviously, I will focus on the north west.  The Government needs to choose a location for that and I might have my own view on that.  From reading the plan, there is a reference in section 3.3 on page 44 to the regional drivers north of Galway city being Derry city.  As much as I want to see a united Ireland - and would do almost anything to see it achieved - in the absence of the Northern Ireland Executive, which I hope will be back in action soon, the responsibility for Derry city is in Whitehall and London with the Tory party.  Are we implementing a plan for the next 20 years for the Republic of Ireland and taking refuge in what is going on in Derry?  We are blind.  If the Government wants to open up that region, three road links are required.  One is a motorway linking from the M1 through Tyrone over to Letterkenny and Derry.  Another is a motorway on the M4 opening all of that end of the country.  The other critically important one is an M17 to give Galway city the benefit of Ireland West Airport Knock and to open up the entire north-west region to the benefit of that.  Then we would begin to put a region to work for itself.  There is plenty of ingenuity among people to make that region into a genuine contributor rather than it being seen, by consecutive Governments of whatever colour, as a drain on national resources.  This plan lacks that vision.  It is more of the same.  It is underpinning the <i>status quo<\/i>, whereby we will stuff 700,000 additional people into the existing primary and secondary cities with nothing in the north west, which we hope to preserve as a weekend retreat for those people in search of Peig Sayers looking out over a half door smoking a pipe and having a pint of Guinness, but that represents a poor use of our resources.  There is nothing in the plan to provide that we would open up that 30% of the shell and core unit, increase our national output, perform to our potential and have the whole nation contributing, rather than this area been seen as a drain.  I will have much more in my submission which I do not have the time to go into today.<br\/><br\/>In terms of planning locally and the issue of rural planning - Deputy Thomas Byrne touched on this earlier - we have a tradition where people live and work in the countryside.  We have contradictory situations in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la is blocking rural enterprise and rural housing while at the same time, other arms of the State are trying to promote that.  The Government cannot have it both ways.  Deputy Durkan mentioned that we had a population of 8 million people back in 1840s.  That is true.  County Sligo, for example, had a population of approximately 185,000.  Does the Minister of State know how many of those people lived in what we know today as Sligo town?  The figure is 7,000.  We have a tradition where people work and live in the rural economy and whether the Government likes it or not we have to facilitate that and we should seek to do that.<br\/><br\/>I am not talking about a hospital consultant or somebody who is from a town, like myself, going out and building a trophy home with a view of the lake or the sea or the mountain.  I am talking about people from such areas and, as was touched on by Deputy Durkan, the repopulating of those areas.  How many ruins of derelict cottages that were once the homes of those 188,000 people in Sligo remain?  They are still there.  Why can we not put homes back there?  The way wastewater treatment has gone is infinitely better today than it was even ten years ago and we should seek to promote that.  Equally, we want to promote more forms of sustainable living and attract people into towns.  There are two things the Minister of State needs to do about that.  First, there is the idea of Part V provision and full integration in a town in order to have the appropriate mix of social and affordable housing, as well as private housing.  That is great and very honourable but the sad reality is that we are not dealing with a blank canvass.  The average nationally in this respect is approximately 14% of social housing, whereas in Sligo, Limerick and Cork, the figure is over 30%.  There is an issue in those three locations where we need to attract in more private housing to complement the balance.  We will not do that unless we attract in people.  For senior citizens in particular, and as I age myself I can see the benefit in this, why are we not incentivising the construction of apartment blocks with a 24-hour concierge service?  We could tell people that if they live in a town, we would waive their property tax and that the State would provide free broadband and free services to encourage people to move to live in towns, particularly older people who would like to have the shop, the general practitioner, the pharmacy and so on their doorstep.  If we do not do that, it is going to continue the way it is.  However, we must also be cognisant of preserving our culture, whereby people live in rural Ireland.  We should not pander to the minorities, hiding behind measures such as the Water Framework Directive or other such measures.  We should look for innovative solutions so that we can preserve and promote that culture.  I will leave it at that and I hope we will have other opportunities to discuss this.  <br\/><br\/>Clearly a great deal of work has gone into this planning framework.  It is not all a waste.  It certainly is not.  However, if one dreams, one should dream big.  This is not a strategic vision for the next 20 years.  It is one that is preparing us to stand still but we need to be prepared to push the boat out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600035#KK00200","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509027600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil deis agam p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach.

I welcome this document.  It replaces the national spatial strategy, which as the previous speaker said came after the national plan.  That national spatial strategy was focused on cities and towns and, as the Minister of State's draft document points out, there were winners and losers.  It was not an inclusive document that looked at developing the country in a sustainable way not only in Dublin but across the regions.  The previous plan also was not based on any statutory footing and there was no investment plan.  I welcome those positive changes and the attempt to look at the country on a more long-term basis.  There are many positives in this document.  One could not find fault with a substantial amount of it in terms the positive language used in it and what it aspires to achieve.  The word &quot;sustainable&quot; is used throughout the document.<\/p><p>However, I have heard Deputies speak earlier about people objecting and that people must become involved.  My experience in my time as a local councillor and as a Member of this House is that people need to be heard.  The people of Galway, not me, and I have repeated this <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, led the way in recycling, and we followed.  The people of Galway forced the people to listen.  My experience, therefore, is not one of people objecting.  My experience is that of active citizens wanting to participate, and they see the problems quicker than we do.  On the ground in Galway, we are constantly facing flooding, the effects of climate change and so on and I would like to put aside the myth that people object.  People are not being heard.<\/p><p>I dealt with the Gaeltacht.  If we look at Galway, interestingly, they have picked a case study of Letterfrack on page 72, with which I am delighted.  It states: &quot;Based in Letterfrack ... and established in 1971, Connemara West plc is a rural community development organisation that has created and delivered innovative rural development initiatives&quot; and so on.  It is wonderful to see that included in the plan.  That organisation on the ground is struggling to get the ear of a Minister. <\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>They want to expand and to bring in more American students and colleges but they are struggling to get the ear of the relevant Minister.  I know that has been going on for the last six months.  It is great that it is in but let us have some action on the ground.<\/p> <p> Galway city is a case where the dream and the reality can be contrasted.  Currently, it has a population of 80,000 and three third level institutions.  Its population swells to well over 100,000 with students and tourists.  The prediction is that it will rise to 124,000 by 2040, which is 22 or 23 years away.  Pages 58 and 59 of the framework document list key future growth enablers for Galway.  It has been said that Galway is choking with traffic.  It certainly has a traffic problem, which is the result of a complete lack of vision by city management, the IDA - I will come back to that point - and successive Governments failing to take a hands-on approach to the city.  I am a proud Galwegian.  It is a marvellous city and I invite everybody to visit.  The problems that have been created could have been avoided and can still be resolved.  Various chapters of the framework document address light rail, particularly for Dublin.  Galway is crying out for a light rail solution.  We have had presentations on it at council level from a number of people on a committee, including businesspeople and others who have worked in Galway and know the problems.  The proposal is being ignored by management in Galway, by the vast majority of politicians on the ground and by the Government.  If I had the Minister of State's ear today, I would say to him that if he is really serious about sustainable development and embracing population change - as I am - he should consider Galway as a city for light rail.  It could help balance the rate of development between Dublin, which is out all proportion to the rest of the country, and Galway.  Galway could happily grow into a city of 150,000 with proper planning. <\/p> <p> This leads me to the issue of planning in Galway.  We have prime sites.  We have Ceannt Station with 14 acres of land in the middle of the city.  Besides that we have the docks with I forget how many acres.  However, there is no master plan.  Ceannt Station is going ahead with its own plan which, I might add, is developer led.  The docks are also developer led and there is also a separate development on the Headford Road.  There is no overall master plan from the local authority.  There is no city architect leading it.  It is vital that the Government take a hands-on approach to this.  On top of that we have an airport that was bought and that is no longer functioning, where there are 114 acres.  All of these sites are crucial to the future sustainable development of the city.<\/p> <p> The developer-driven plans have an emphasis on office space to the detriment of housing units.  I have repeatedly said that we have a housing crisis in Galway.  There are at least 13,000 people on a waiting list since 2002.  They cannot access a home nor a house on the private market, under the housing assistance payment scheme, HAP, or under the city council.  The city council stopped building in 2009 and is only building 14 houses this year.  I am using my time to highlight the opportunities in Galway and to warn against the repetition of past mistakes in respect of developer-led development without vision, without a master plan and without an integrated solution that would allow for housing, business and light rail.<\/p> <p> The IDA has played a Trojan part in bringing employment and jobs to Galway, as I have said at the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, it has done so on a single site, which has created huge traffic problems and left the city council struggling.  In addition, there is no park-and-ride facility in Galway although it has been on the city development plan since 2005.  It has never been implemented.  There are sustainable solutions in Galway.  It is an example of a city that should be looked at as a model if we are seriously interested in sustainable development.<\/p> <p> In the minute I have left I would like to point to the absence of any policy in the framework document on the islands of our country.  There is absolutely no mention of them.  Our islands are gallantly struggling to survive through co-operatives and various organisations.  Generally I welcome the vision in the document.  It is the operation on the ground that is in question, and the fact that the damage will be done before we ever get to implement this.  There is a lack of items in the plan in respect of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, and absolutely no policy on the islands.  I am sure we will have another chance to discuss this when the plan comes out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600036#LL00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509028200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Ireland 2040 plans for where we will be about 22 years from now.  As Deputy Connolly has said, there is much in the document to be welcomed.  There is much in it that is very aspirational, that is very good and that we want to see happen.  An awful lot of it is very vague, however.  That is one of the problems I have with it.  I am thinking of the sections on agriculture, forestry, tourism and all of that for rural Ireland.  There is an absence of vision for people to be able to live long lives in rural Ireland.  That is what is needed if we are to regenerate the regions and rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture has been the backbone because it is where productivity comes from.  It is where the money is made that is spent in the local communities and areas.  In most parts of my constituency where we are talking about suckler cows and sheep, the farmers are making very little money to spend anywhere.  That is the problem we have.  In general, they are depending on the cheque coming from Europe to sustain themselves, their livelihoods and the entire livelihoods of everyone who lives around them as well.  There needs to be a re-focus on what we are going to do for the farming sector to ensure that it is viable into the future, and how it can be done in a way that will work for people living on marginal land mainly in smallholdings which are family farms.  They are a unique asset of ours when it comes to marketing our produce and ourselves as a nation.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is rural decline and depopulation.  Yesterday evening at 8 o'clock, I was at a meeting in Drumkeeran community centre in County Leitrim.  It was about a small school called Tarmon school, which is on the shores of Lough Allen.  Last year and this year, no child has started in the school.  The three children in sixth class are leaving next year and if no more families come and no more children start, it will become a one-teacher school, which will be unsustainable and the school will disappear.  Many of those small schools are going.  Without getting into the argument about how good or bad it may be for children to be in a very small school, the story this is telling is that rural Ireland is dying.  When I stand at Tarmon school and look around me, all I can see on the horizon are trees - Sitka spruce is growing everywhere.  If that is the future, then we are only going to have foxes and badgers living on marginal land because there will be no people.  Forestry does not really provide any employment or the labour intensity that would sustain communities and people.  There has to be a vision for rural Ireland which is better than this.<\/p>  <p>  The people at the meeting last night were saying the only way out was to do what they did in Kiltyclogher, which had a similar problem last summer.  They started a project called KiltyLive.  They invited people from the cities to come and live in Kiltyclogher, a beautiful place in north Leitrim.  They got six or seven families to come.  They did up a number of old houses and people came and lived in them.  I think seven or eight extra children started in the school, so it is up to where it needs to be and will grow from there.  It is not just about keeping a small school going.  It is about keeping a whole community going.  If there is a problem with a school, that means there is an awful big problem out there that needs to be solved.  This document is aspirational about all of that, while the nuts and bolts of it are really not there.<\/p><p>If we want people to live in places such as Drumkeeran, Tarmon and Kiltyclogher, we have to ensure there are GP, bus and education services there for them.  There must also be opportunities there for them and a sense of future.  What is missing in many places in rural Ireland is a sense of future.  Following the meeting, I spoke to a farmer who is approaching retirement and has four children.  He told me that instead of encouraging his children to remain on the farm, he told them to go to college, get a good job and get out of the area, but that he now thinks he was wrong because life in rural Ireland is a wonderful life.  In regard to people moving from the cities to rural Ireland, there was a man at the meeting from Kiltyclogher who spoke of his move from Dublin to Kiltyclogher and of the sense of safety and community that exists in rural Ireland.  One gets the sense that one is not just an individual but is part of something bigger.  This is the sense one gets from small rural communities.  If we lose this, we lose the essence of what is to be Irish.  The Government needs to focus on this when drafting plans of this type.  Plans are great and wonderful but they are aspirational.  For them to be implemented, investment is needed.  <\/p> <p> When I raise issues with Ministers, be it about schools buses, about which I spoke earlier to the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, or other issues, the response is always that if the demand does not exist for a service it cannot be provided, but if a service is not available there will never be demand.  People will not live in areas where there are no services.  If there are no services there are no opportunities and if there are no opportunities, there is no activity.  If we are to create a spiral upwards, we must have opportunity and activity.  People bring about activity.  Everything arises out of the human being striving to achieve.  In many areas in rural Ireland, people are not striving; they are sitting back watching time tick by and hoping that everything will be all right.  That will not work.  Rather than producing glossy reports, the Government needs to invest money in the development of rural areas; otherwise, we are lost.  The call for investment in rural Ireland is not a just cry from the wilderness because investment in rural Ireland is an investment in the country.  <\/p> <p> At the meeting I spoke of earlier, the man who moved from west Dublin to Kiltyclogher in 1966 or 1967 also told of the wonderful life his family have had there and the wonderful place it is.  He also told of how when the community in Dublin come to visit him they frequently tell him, \"You're in Heaven here; we wish we could have that\".  Reference was made earlier to the school in Tarmon that is on the verge of closure and to the attention given to the children attending that school and how well they are educated there.  If children in Dublin wanted to attend a school like that, they would have to pay thousands of euro to do so.  To get a place in such a school, parents would have to enrol their children before they are even baptised.  The opportunity exists in rural Ireland to give people a better chance, a better place to live and work and move forward.    <\/p> <p> The issues arising are about a divide between east and west and, in the main, a divide between what we choose to do and not do.  When I was listening to the debate earlier, I heard Deputy Mattie McGrath say that there was no point in politics or politicians because the bankers are in control of everything and we are powerless and do not matter.  There is a sense these days in society and in politics that nobody has any power to address issues in regard to the HSE and so on, that all of these problems are too big for any of us to solve.  That is very dangerous.  Government is powerful.  It does have the power to bring about change and to make things better for rural communities and for people who are in mortgage distress and so on, but Government has to choose to do that.  Government has to make definite choices to show it stands by the people.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Catherine Connolly spoke out the islands and our coastal and fishing communities.  By and large, the only fishing activity open to people in small harbour communities around the country is lobster pots because they are banned from fishing the sea, yet super trawlers are allowed to do so.  If we are to revive the island communities, coastal communities and small fishing communities the length and breadth of the country, we have to provide them with the opportunity to make a living.  There are many references to investment in this document.  The aim of this plan must be to ensure that there are opportunities available to people to do an honest day's work, for which they receive a good day's pay, and a sense that the future of their children in their areas will be better than theirs.<\/p> <p> Most people living in rural Ireland believe that if their children are to have a better life they need to leave rural Ireland.  That is not good.  It is a failure on the part not only of this Government, but of every Government since the foundation of this State.  When the late Eamon De Valera set up the Land Commission, some people from the west moved to Meath and other people in the west expanded their farms.  The mindset that there is no hope for those living on marginal land in the west of Ireland and so on needs to change.  We need to provide hope.  This will require a change in mindset.  While this document goes someway towards that, it does not go far enough, which is its failure.<\/p> <p> There are many issues I could discuss today, including renewable energy and other opportunities that could be brought about.  We could talk about broadband and the fact that there is practically no broadband service available in any part of rural Ireland to anyone who wants to work there, if they had that opportunity.  My question for the Minister of State, Deputy English, is if the mindset is going to change.  We have many documents of this type.  I am sure we could fill this Chamber with the many documents that have been produced since the foundation of this State on the issue of what needs to be done for rural areas, what we need to do to redevelop Ireland's spatial strategies and so on.  What has not changed is the mindset that the only hope for people from the west of Ireland is to move them out of it.  If this does not change, nothing will change.  That mindset has to change and this can only happen if we bring investment to the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600037#MM00200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509028800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the national planning framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600038#NN00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1509028800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>My apologies, Deputy, I called you too soon.

I was struck to hear members of the Government bemoan constructive criticism and state that there had been wide consultation on the plan.  I agree that consultation meetings were held in various parts of the country but some of the issues identified were not heeded.  Consultation for the sake of it is pointless.<\/p>  <p>  The Government had proposed a two-hour debate on this plan but members of the Business Committee forced the issue and demanded a far more substantive debate than two hours on this plan that will direct how the country is to grow and develop over the next 20 plus years.  Given the longevity of this plan and its importance, it might be worthwhile extending the deadline in respect of submissions on the draft.  The current timeframe is too tight.  The submissions of many chambers of commerce are undertaken in a voluntary capacity in conjunction with other work.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to give consideration to extending that deadline.  <\/p>  <p>  Critical to how this country develops will be the new capital plan but we have not yet had sight of what is in the plan.<\/p><p>In terms of transport, for which I am Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, the Minister, Deputy Ross, promised to make his submission to the capital plan known but is yet to so do.  He admitted his plan would be based on what money he gets rather than what he needs.  It is essential to analyse our existing infrastructure and identify where improvements need to be made.  We should not say we will do what we can within a tight budget but, rather, ask what infrastructural projects are needed to ensure there is a proper integrated transport network across the island.  If there are financial constraints, projects should be dealt with based on priority.<br\/><br\/>Members do not know, for instance, the status of the DART underground project.  It is possibly one of the most critical infrastructural developments for the capital because it connects and makes the best use of existing rail networks in the city.  Members do not know at what stage it is.  They do not know the status of the proposed motorway between Mullingar and Sligo, which is another critical piece of infrastructure to ensure the midlands and west receive investment and nor do Members know the status of the Limerick to Cork road or that of the A5, which will connect with the North.<br\/><br\/>The new chairman of Irish Rail told the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport yesterday that Irish Rail needs &euro;103 million per annum for the next five years to maintain tracks and a steady state for its existing infrastructure.  We need far greater ambition in terms of what can be done in rail infrastructure.  Deputy Connolly spoke about light rail for Galway.  Railway tracks in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath need to be upgraded to a twin line.  Places such as Mullingar will have the opportunity to develop and grow when they are connected with the eastern seaboard.<br\/><br\/>The national planning framework refers to &quot;Improving access to Dublin Airport, to include improved public transport access, connections from the road network from the west and north and in the longer term, consideration of heavy rail access to facilitate direct services from the national rail network in the context of potential future electrification.&quot;  However, when I asked the Minister, Deputy Ross, a question about rail connection to Dublin Airport on 19 October 2017, his reply stated:<\/p><blockquote>It does not include the Clongriffin spur to Dublin airport or another heavy rail connection to the airport.  There are no plans to reconsider this issue at this time.<\/blockquote><p>There are contradictions between what the Minister with responsibility for the area says and what has been outlined in the plan.<br\/><br\/>The draft plan reaffirms the imbalance in favour of the east coast and a bias in favour of Dublin and the four other main growth centres, namely, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  There are gaping omissions in provision for the midlands and the north west.  There is no ambition to help those areas grow and develop.  A comprehensive plan was submitted in regard to Athlone.  The CEO of Athlone Chamber of Commerce told me his organisation realises Athlone needs to grow as a region.  The midlands region generally, including Longford, Westmeath and Tullamore, can grow and develop and help counter-balance the emphasis that has been put on the eastern seaboard.  There is nothing in that regard in the framework.<br\/><br\/>I am greatly concerned by the discriminatory policy against one-off housing in the countryside contained in the provision, which requires that a housing need demand assessment be included in all future development plans.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, represents a rural constituency and knows how difficult it is for those born and bred in a particular area to obtain planning permission.  If the housing need demand assessment is enforced, it is my view and that of senior planners that it will be next to impossible to obtain.  Members have spoken of the death of rural communities, the loss of teachers from schools and the loss of services because there is nobody in the towns and villages to support them.  The housing need demand assessment would have a detrimental effect in that regard and serious consideration should be given to removing it from the framework and county development plans because it will cause much difficulty if it comes in.<br\/><br\/>Representatives of Longford County Council told me they have huge concerns in respect of the framework and believe it will adversely affect smaller counties such as Longford.  They made the point that midland counties are the principal beneficiaries of the redistribution of the local property tax equalisation fund, receiving &euro;21.6 million in 2017.  In contrast, Dublin and other eastern counties contributed more than &euro;50 million to the fund in 2017, which illustrates the current imbalance.  The Government will not enable smaller towns such as Kilbeggan, Moate, Ballymahon, Granard and Edgeworthstown grow in any real or substantial way because of the arbitrary targets to be imposed upon them.  If the Government is not going to let towns grow but is going to impose more restrictions on people seeking to obtain one-off rural houses, how will rural Ireland be supported?  How will shops and post offices be supported?  How will we ensure there are adequate staff for schools?  It will not be supported.  Although I acknowledge much work went into the national planning framework and officials met those who made submissions, given the severity, importance and longevity of the report, it should be pushed out for several weeks.  It should be debated in the House in conjunction with the capital plan because the capital plan and infrastructural investment over the coming decade will be so important for sustainable growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600038#NN00400","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509029400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this so-called national planning framework.  I have a different name for it.  I call it the national planning to be an F word and up at the backwood, because it is anti-rural.  No thought has been put into it.  I went to the launch of the framework in Sligo by the former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  He encouraged people to make submissions.  I held a meeting in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county to learn about the county and its needs and I am sure other Deputies did likewise.  I called a meeting in Sligo.  I went to counties Cavan, Roscommon, Leitrim, Galway and Mayo to listen to people and try to form a constructive plan for what has been called the BMW or Border, midlands, west region, which has been deprived of funding for many years.  When I look at what emerged on paper, I wonder why I bothered doing all of that.  Other Members said officials reverted to those who made submissions.  I made probably one of the most detailed submissions on every county I have named but did not see much reference to it in terms of what is to be done for those counties or what is ahead of them.  The person responsible for the framework must not have gone outside the M50.<\/p>  <p>  There is reference to the DART underground in Dublin.  I took the DART to Malahide yesterday.<\/p><p>I come from a construction background.  If &euro;200 million can build a DART line out to the airport, continuing to Swords and other areas, it should be done - a stitch in time saves nine - instead of dreaming of spending &euro;4 billion that will never be spent if we are honest and straight with people.<\/p> <p> When the Minister launched the national planning framework in Sligo, I had understood that we were to focus on cities and large towns and ensure that rural life keeps going.  Sligo was among the towns nominated to become a city.  Will this be done?  No.  Athlone was also nominated.  County Roscommon gets very little mention altogether.  Galway city is mentioned in the framework, but the problem is that the counties in the west seem to be forgotten.  Cromwell said, \"To hell or to Connacht.\"  This document seems to say, \"To hell or to a big city or larger town.  Forget about the rural areas.\"<\/p> <p> The Brits are working on the A5 from Derry down to Aughnacloy.  A spur needs to go out to the M1.  Do the people in Letterkenny or other areas of Donegal not deserve a proper road?  Should there not be a proper road from Letterkenny to Sligo, further on to Charlestown and on to meet the new motorway?  This is not even in my constituency, but it is about ensuring balanced regional development.  It is about giving everyone an opportunity and not having an apartheid system whereby the best roads and rail and everything else are in one part of the country and there is nothing elsewhere.  Do those employing people in Mayo and similar counties not deserve a proper road when they come off the M4 on the approach to Mullingar, go through Edgeworthstown and Longford and continue towards Castlebar?  In my opinion, they do.<\/p> <p> Regarding rail, let us be honest with people: the plan is to get rid of four rail lines, not to increase the number of lines, at a time when our Government preaches about climate change, public transport and what we will do in 2020 and 2030.  At the same time, there is no vision for the kind of infrastructure required.  The national planning framework, together with another document being circulated to county managers throughout Ireland, says it very clearly: one-off houses will not be built in rural areas.  By saying this, we are telling people in communities that are under a fair amount of pressure - and their local schools and shops - to wither away and die out.  Above all, the one great thing in rural Ireland is the community.  If the Government starves communities when it comes to one-off housing, it will ensure the slow death of rural Ireland.<\/p> <p> Honesty is required when putting a plan together, but the national planning framework seems to be tilted in one direction.  In fairness, there are major problems inside the M50; more roads and railway lines are needed.  Dublin Airport must be the only main airport in the world that is not connected to a railway service.  That is a damning indictment because this is a problem if we are trying to bring in tourism.  We need tourism in the west of Ireland.  The Wild Atlantic Way is a great success.  How does one get to it?  One must hire a car or cycle.  Those are the only two ways.  There is no train or bus to bring people directly to it.  That will not bring in the number of people we need to allow many places in rural Ireland to survive and be viable.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State needs to go back to the drawing board.  We are talking about submissions, but is attention paid to submissions?  Did I waste my time booking rooms for meetings in various hotels in six or seven counties because I passionately believe that an area of the country that has been neglected for years deserves the same as any other area?  Does this plan examine the position of the farming community, for example?  When the country was going down the Swanee, the farming community kept it going.  Unfortunately, in our areas, especially in the west, we suffered mass emigration because of the sins that were committed.  Every politician right across the board is working to try to ensure that jobs are created, but one must create incentives and ensure a fair playing field.  As Deputy Martin Kenny rightly pointed out, if there are trees growing around people in every field, there will be no community, and if the Government subsidises this, it will choke the life out of rural areas in all counties, especially in the west, which has been badly affected.<\/p> <p> Is there a vision for Longford, a town which, in my opinion, has been neglected for years?  Is there a vision to make Athlone into a city?  We hear all the talk and lovely vibes to the effect that we need another city.  Waterford and Sligo were mentioned.  However, this plan basically tells everyone to head to the few cities we have and create bigger ghettos.  Unfortunately, the infrastructure and the housing are not there, and if we keep doing this, we will turn Ireland from a managed landscape into a wilderness.  Perhaps that is the plan - to bring in the Yanks and the other tourists to look at trees growing instead of fields being productive, instead of what we call life in these areas, instead of vibrant communities working together for a common benefit.  Those communities might be small but there may be children going to school in Dublin today who are nearly on top of each other in classrooms.  What they would not give if they only knew the freedom and the kind of education they can get when class sizes are not as big?<\/p> <p> We must go back to the drawing board.  I will let the Deputies from the south speak for themselves.  I am talking about the west, which has been neglected not only by this Government but also by those which preceded it.  It has been the bad child at the back door; it got nothing and was never looked after.  It needs fair play.  The Minister of State - in the context of this document - needs to consider seriously how communities are made sustainable.  Consider the way in which the single farm payment is dished out.  The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and, unfortunately, it is the family farm that is getting poorer.  As Deputy Martin Kenny said earlier, fathers are telling their families that they had better go to school, go to college and move away.  Unfortunately, these families have not got fair play.  If that keeps happening, the Government will get its wish in this plan of ensuring rural Ireland's demise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600039#OO00200","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509030600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>In considering the planning framework, it is important we set realistic expectations in terms of what a planning framework should look like.  Too often, I have seen in local area plans a situation where much is promised and little is delivered.  The difficulty seems to be that the very nature of a planning framework is aspirational and is centred on land use objectives and possibilities for particular areas.  However, the missing link, which is delivery, capital and funding, is very often missing from the equation.  This can create a misconception for users of that information, in particular the general public, when they begin to review plans - I will use the example of a local area plan hierarchy as it is the one I am most familiar with.  This can create false expectations when people view a plan, and these have often been created by a local authority that has set out to speculate as to what could happen at a particular site or building, were a number of things to happen.<\/p>  <p>  A planner will colour in a map with a particular colour and an artist's impression can then be created of a particular facility.  Perhaps a farmer's land may be coloured as an amenity and open space, which then lends itself to an artist's impression of a sports field with a campus, facilities, leisure hall, gym, car park, access roads and all sorts of wonderful things around it.  In one extreme example in the town of Kilcock, which went through a local area plan in the past two years - the Minister of State will be familiar with it as it is across the water from Meath - all that is missing is the palm trees.  The county council planners drew up an impression of the town square and what it would look like when remodelled under the local area plan.  A very impressive, futuristic and desirable scene was created, but it bore no resemblance to reality because, in order for that fantastic plaza to be developed, with or without palm trees, ownership of it had to cede to the public purse or to anybody who was willing to do something with it.  The plot had to be bought and sold, it had to be capitalised and it had to receive planning permission and funding, before going ahead to completion in order to be used.  There are many steps in a planning framework which may never be realised.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty is that this leads to a sense of false expectations among the community.  It also leads to gaps in the plans which mean we end up with brownfield sites, unutilised greenfield sites and worse situations such as derelict buildings.  In the plan, these might have made sense because, if the plan came to pass, these would no longer be vacant sites but, unfortunately, they are often vacant without that follow-through and development.<\/p>  <p>  At a higher level, in the national planning framework we are discussing today, one can see a similar approach at regional level.  I represent Kildare North and I have heard speakers today talk about Meath, Wicklow and Louth, which are commuter belt counties and have seen extreme volumes of growth in the past 15 to 20 years.  However, the population increase has not been matched by an increase in facilities, amenities and public and private transport links.  Educational and health care facilities are not in place and there is a lack of employment opportunities.  These are the gaps we need to begin filling in a national planning framework at regional level in order to take this step up from the local area plans.<\/p>  <p>  Kildare North has seen high population growth.  The town I live in, Sallins, has grown from 500 people in the 1999 census to 5,000 in the most recent census, a 1,000% increase, and at one stage it was labelled the fastest growing town in Europe.  This has happened without any amenities being added, such as additional playing fields.  Thankfully, the rail infrastructure has begun to creep back into gear and has improved greatly, but there is still a long way to go and we are again seeing the problem of overloaded trains and buses, and of services being inadequate to cater for the demand, given current capacity.  Amenities have been an issue for a long time.  On housing, we have come from a situation of having a surplus to having a massive deficit, as we are all now well aware, yet we have done nothing in the meantime to fill the amenity gaps in those spaces.  We now have a very real need for multiples of housing units to be delivered but let us hope that, this time, we do not make the mistake of the past, which was to deliver them in isolation, without the services, infrastructure and amenities to support them.<\/p>  <p>  There is a possibility for people to live in regional areas in a distributed way and the concept of the greater Dublin area is one that can be pursued in terms of the commuter counties being part of that.  The fundamental concept of having people living in the commuter counties and working in Dublin is a viable one, but it is a difficult one at present because of the lack of public transport linkage, educational infrastructure and other amenities.  If we can fill those gaps, it is an answer to the housing crisis, among other things, because it would make it possible, attractive and feasible for people to live in farther-flung places yet enjoy access to work, in order to further their careers, and access to education.  In this way, it becomes an enabler because people are able to attend universities a little further from home, without having to break the bank to do so, if they can commute to access educational institutions.<\/p>  <p>  This would also see social capital and social connections beginning to be forged.  If somebody is originally from north Dublin and ends up living in south Kildare, and there is extended family distributed across a number of counties, decent public transport connections and a decent planning framework will allow relatively straightforward movement between the areas.  People can visit each other and stay in touch, and the distance is not as amplified as it might sometimes be.  This is often the case with cities internationally, where people have extended family and friends.  On the Continent, it is not unusual to commute to a party or visit friends for dinner even if they live 90 minutes away, because people hop on a train and it is a pretty straightforward journey.  That would be quite unusual here and people would generally have to stay overnight, so it is less done.  The idea of distributed population has worked very successfully in other areas but we have not grasped it here.  Therefore, we still have the problems of gridlock and social mismatch, whereby people are cut off from their extended family.  This also applies to many other structures, for example, to child care, education and social bonds, inclusivity and the feeling of belonging and making a home from home in a new commuter belt location, which often may not be where people started out.<\/p>  <p>  These are some of the challenges we have to face when we sit down to look at the national planning framework.  While I am most familiar with regional and local planning, I have seen too often in the past these mistakes being made and repeated.  Making a mistake once is bad, but making it twice is worse.  I hope the national planning framework will succeed.  I hope it will consider employment opportunities around the country and in the regions, as well as in the centre.  While we acknowledge that the centre is going to remain at the hub of the majority of activity, which is probably realistic in the medium term, if we can put the connections into services in order to get people in and out of the centre, to plan for that and, at the same time, to deliver quality of life amenities, health care, education, sporting opportunities and all of those vital surrounding factors where people are living today, that will provide the basis for a successful framework.  I very much hope that is where the plan will turn out to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600041#QQ00100","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1509030600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I am a great fan of science fiction.  I have to say that when I hear about visions for 2040 and for national planning frameworks, and the beautiful visions that are set out in such documents, I immediately think of science fiction.<\/p><p>The vision is beautiful but the reality often turns out to bear no relation whatsoever to the vision that has been set out.  It is a bit like in science fiction where one has two genres - the one where there is a plan for the future that everybody can subscribe to and which has everything one would want in it.  It is balanced, harmonious and integrated.  It could happen if we planned rationally and democratically.<\/p> <p> The other genre is the dystopian nightmare.  I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy English, that the utopian vision that is often presented in these plans rarely comes to pass.  Much more often than not we end up with the dystopian nightmare because regardless of how beautiful the plan is and how well thought out it is, the people who make the plan actually have no real power to implement it because they have ceded the power to make the important decisions to other people who have no interest whatsoever in the plan.  It will not surprise the Minister of State to know that I am talking about the market and the dynamics of the market.  We, as the democratically elected representatives of the people, set out a plan and consult with the people.  There is, however, a question about the extent to which we have actually consulted or consult with the people who are the real stakeholders on this or any other plan.  Even if we do this and we develop a well integrated and harmonious vision for the future, that plan is undermined, subverted, ruined and neutralised - whatever one wants to call it - by the fact that those people with large amounts of money, investors, people with capital, the banks, the developers and the private owners of the land are the ones who make the decisions.<\/p> <p> With regard to previous spatial frameworks I have heard many of our rural colleagues in the House speaking on the destruction of rural Ireland.  They know, far better than I do, about the realities of the destruction of rural Ireland.  As an urban Deputy I absolutely agree with them.  We periodically produce plans - this plan will do it again - which are aspirations to do something to ensure we have proper regionally balanced development and to maintain sustainable town and village life in rural Ireland.  That is a beautiful plan, but does it happen?  To date it certainly has not happened.  We have had increasing centralisation in a few hubs such as Dublin, Cork and one or two others.  This is regardless of spatial plans and the aspirations for regional development.  Why does this happen?  It is because the decisions about where investment happens are taken by big business and big capital.  They dictate it.  We have a Government, and I would say the two major parties in the State, that actively facilitate the ceding of their own power to these voracious entities and capitalists - to use old-fashioned left-wing language.  We end up simply trailing and facilitating them.  They decide where the investment is going to and the Government facilitates them, which renders all the plans nonsense.<\/p> <p> I shall give a few examples in different areas.  Ireland wants to sustain its small towns and villages but that cannot be done if the Government cuts the bus services while telling us that commercial viability has to be the main criteria by which we judge the viability of bus services.  This is what is done and we hear it week in and week out, especially from Fine Gael.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, however, it was not much different.  We hear that the service must be commercially viable, but if we want to protect our small towns and villages then sorry, we need a bus service and public transport services whose future is not determined by whether or not they are commercially viable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600041#QQ00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509031200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>It is like Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600042#RR00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1509031200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>What does the Deputy mean &quot;like Dublin&quot;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600042#RR00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1509031200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Like the &euro;60 million given to subsidise-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600042#RR00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1509031200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Okay, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v wants to play Dublin off against the country.  As an urban Deputy I want to see rural Ireland protected and I make the point that in order to do that we do not privatise or bring to bear commercial priorities to services such as public transport.  If we do that - we are doing it - bus services and transport infrastructure will be cut to those areas.  Post offices will be closed - this has been done.  Small schools will close because it is all about the viability, in the narrowest possible terms, of these particular services.  The market does not consider it a good idea to subsidise bus services or transport infrastructure or to have post offices that achieve social goals, if they cannot at the same time make money.  No matter how good it was, in reality is the plan goes out the window.<\/p><p>Housing is another obvious example of this.  The market completely undermines any of the spatial plans.  Ireland's recent experience is an obvious example of that.  I remember the regional planning guidelines that dictated certain big developments in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area.  This included building houses on green spaces because certain population projections for building houses had to be met.  Planning permission was given for certain developments but the joke was that these houses were built by the market that had no interest in actually connecting the homes they built to the people who needed the houses.  The houses were built and the people could not afford the houses.  The value of those units collapsed, the banks collapsed and we still had people who were homeless with nowhere to live.  The market stopped building, the banks stopped lending and the people who needed the houses have left the State because there is no work for them as the economy has collapsed.  In any event they could not afford the houses that were built.  For six or seven years no houses were built, even though we had these beautiful plans and projections about population growth.  It was all rendered meaningless because the housing market was completely privatised.  The investment decisions and the infrastructure investment that would go with it was, in the end, actually decided by private banks and private developers.  The Government continues to put the decision making into their hands, even as we face a housing and homelessness emergency.  I do not really see the point in these national framework plans if the Government continues to cede control over land, property and capital more generally into the hands of these entities.<\/p><p>I shall give another example of forestry and Coillte.  If Ireland is to tackle the environmental issues facing us - it is one of the big imperatives for the future - then we must do something serious about carbon emissions.  Again, commercial imperatives prevent the Government from doing this because it does not want to give over land to forestry, which would be a carbon sink and so on.  Ireland pleads to the EU that we do not want to have to meet the targets and that we want special treatment and so on and so forth.  Coillte is the body that is supposed to plant forests.  In the business pages of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>this week one will read that Coillte now wants to engage in public private partnerships to use its land to build giant wind farms.  The article also says that Coillte then plans to sell them off.  This has not been mentioned in the D&aacute;il this week.  Coillte is explicit about this.It is going to sell off Coillte estate.  We need to control whether we are going to be the ones to decide what happens to land use and what we will do around environmental protection and climate mitigation.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>How can we do that if the body in charge of 7% of the land mass of the State and which is charged with the afforestation of the country plans to sell off massive tracts of land to its public private partners?  How can we control or have any influence on the future if that is what we are doing?  Those examples can be multiplied across almost every sector of the economy.  I believe in planning and in consultation and input but what is the point when all the other plans have come to nothing while the market has dictated our circumstances until now?  What is the point if we continue to allow big business and corporations to gain control of more land, infrastructure, services and capital because the Government will not tax them?  Wealth is concentrated ever more in their hands while the population is left as a passive bystander to watch what the multinational corporations do to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600042#RR00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509031800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>First, I note that the idea of having ten minutes to deal with something that is meant to affect the future of every citizen is ludicrous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600043#SS00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1509031800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600043#SS00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1509031800,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Whoever arranged this debate is doing a disservice.

When one starts reading this, one finds a lot of hidden stuff.  A lot of stuff is written in fairly turgid text which makes it very hard to decipher what exactly is meant.

Is not the whole island of Ireland, in fact, only the size of a city area in the United States of America, for example, where one often gets twin cities with recreational areas complementing them?  I wonder, therefore, if our vision is right and whether we recognise how small this little island is.  I have found it baffling as a Dublin person to see the great deal of damage done to quality of life in the city by so-called \"planners\" by the unnecessary concentration of employment, in particular employment the State controls, with all the attendant problems that causes.  I am very critical of rural people who keep going around with the b&eacute;al bocht because in many ways, rural living has a lot of advantages.  We do not face congestion and most of us do not have heroin on our doorsteps.  There tends to be very good housing.  Most of my neighbours at home have a good life.  The only problem is that there is not enough gainful employment to give more people a good life in the area.  When I look at the city of Dublin, I see it getting rapidly worse.  If one does not get in here by 7 a.m., one can forget it until about 11 a.m.  Getting out of the city presents the same problem in the evening.  It takes an hour and a half.  It will take an investment of billions of euro in public transport and a population freeze to resolve that issue.<\/p>  <p>  I look at parts of the city other than those parts of the south side which others look at, notwithstanding that I am very familiar with those too having come from the Donnybrook-Ballsbridge area and having gone to school in Mount Merrion.  I look at places like the Oliver Bond flat complex, west Tallaght, Neilstown and Ronanstown and I ask what chance in life do many of the children in these areas have.  I know very well the lady who, quite rightly, took a court case against Dublin City Council for over-concentrating homeless centres in a centre she had been using, until it was closed down, to provide pre-school and after-school meals for young children from the Liberties.  This lady comes from a flat complex in the Liberties herself and has devoted her life to these young children.  I remember doing a presentation of certificates for her to beautiful young kids of 14 years of age.  Four or five years later, I met her and she is on the phone to me regularly.  We are good friends.  I told her that I presumed some of those kids had got caught up in the web of drugs and social problems which bedevil the area and she told me that, unfortunately, that was so.  They were the most beautiful kids I ever met.  Anyone who tells me that is great living and that it is the kind of Ireland to which we aspire is wrong.  That is the part of the city that is ignored by the planners.  They would rather dream of the parts of the city that they know and which do not suffer from those problems.<\/p>  <p>  It is tragic that I have only four minutes left.  The document says the following about rural planning: \"Careful planning is required to manage demand in our most accessible countryside areas around cities and towns, focusing on the functional requirements of rural economies and rural communities and in compliance with EU treaties whereas remoter rural areas should benefit from a more flexible approach, particularly where they help to sustain fragile communities\".  It then sets out that these areas are defined by a commuter catchment of at least 15% of the relevant city area workforce.  It then says that in rural areas of urban influence, one must have a demonstrable economic need to live in a rural area and that the relevant siting criteria for rural housing are the statutory guidelines.  It also says that in areas under urban influence, it will continue to be necessary to demonstrate a functional economic requirement for housing need.<\/p>  <p>  Do I have the Minister of State's attention?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600043#SS00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1509031800,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Yes.

I ask not to be given the carbon argument, because in ten or 15 years, we will all have electric cars.  I ask not to be given the wastewater argument, because we look after our wastewater better than the municipal authorities, from whose activities the vast number of serious wastewater issues arise.

Moreover, it is not true that one needs to show a functional economic requirement.<\/p>  <p>  Another absolutely amazing aspect of the document is its discussion of something an tAthair Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il has spoken about many times - the gentrification of the countryside.  Poor people are being moved out because of a refusal to build local authority housing while middle-class or wealthy people can afford to live in the countryside.

If we are looking beyond the horizon of 2040, we have to look beyond traditional forms of transport and infrastructure.  We also have to consider what will be required to sustain communities, both rural and urban, to ensure quality of life.  The key areas are health and education, particularly at first, second and third level.  There must be investment in our health system.  The population will dramatically increase by up to 1 million in the coming years.  More people will live longer but will experience many more complications.  The framework must take into account the many attributes that make up a positive society.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to a number of issues that will have to be examined, such as the urbanisation of our communities and how to ensure quality of life in these urban environments.  Many of our urban environments, unfortunately, do not have the necessary infrastructure - such as cr&egrave;che and education facilities, proper housing stock and other supports for community development - in place to allow them to prosper.  We have to learn from the mistakes of the past.  We cannot simply go into panic mode now and plan to build houses without proper strategic thinking.  I can instance many large housing estates that were built in previous times in the absence of foresight or vision regarding what was required for sustainable communities.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be ambitious and imaginative.  We are at a critical juncture in our history.  In previous times, political parties and Governments of all hues made bold leaps and took initiatives to expand the country's capacity.  Now is the time to do that again.  There will be a large increase in the population and that will require significant investment to ensure that the economy is competitive and that resources are maximised.  One of the difficulties we have is the European budgetary system and the deficit targets that have to be met.  We have to be able to write down capital investments over a longer period.  I cannot understand why such investments have to be written down over four years.  The cost of a hospital or road that might last 40 years has to be written down over four years in the context of budgetary arithmetic.  That puts a huge brake on the capacity of the State to fund long-term critical infrastructure, such as roads, schools and hospitals, and it will retard the ability of the State to invest in itself on behalf of its citizens.  I urge the Government to examine the budgetary process.  There is a 10% cap on funding of infrastructure through PPPs.  The reason I instance that is money can be borrowed on the markets at 0%.  There is free money available in terms of interest rates.  While we are pinched in the context of deficiencies in our capital infrastructure programme, now is the time not only to plan but to build infrastructure.  The Government should use whatever political influence it has in Europe when negotiating the Brexit deal because we will be at a severe disadvantage because of Brexit and there might be an exemption from EU budgetary rules for countries that are well funded through their own budgetary process but that fall foul of EU laws if they invest in critical infrastructural developments and make a long-term investment in people to expand the capacity of an economy.  That should be examined.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said this process started in February and many Members are being repetitive in asking for an extension.  There are people outside the House who would like to make submissions in respect of the framework following the Minister's request and they should be accommodated in view of the fact that an additional few weeks will not make much difference.  Let us be honest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600044#TT01700","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1509032400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I am not against that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600044#TT01800","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1509032400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The Government parties do no exactly spring into action every morning when they get up and, therefore, another few weeks will not delay the process too much if we just give everybody an opportunity to contribute.  Those who wish to take that opportunity will do so and those who do not want to do so will not.  However, we should be fair to everybody.<\/p>  <p>  In its submission, Fianna F&aacute;il has sought the establishment of a national infrastructure commission.  That would be important because we need to gel all the aspects of the economy together to make it cohesive, to streamline investment and planning and to ensure investment follows populations trends and movements.  Such a commission would be good for all those reasons because it would pull all aspects of Government spending together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government parties have not covered themselves in glory on housing.  There is no point in saying anything otherwise and there is no much point in the Minister of State disputing that.  There is a great deal of work to be done and they have acknowledged that they need to do more.  They have said they are doing their best.  Unfortunately, however, their best will fall dramatically short of what is required given the increased demand for housing alone based on current population trends coupled with demographic changes over the next few years.  The Government has not planned for an older population in the context of housing.  That fact should be examined.  Everyone is talking about building three-bedroom, semi-detached houses across the country but there is no strategic thinking about how people will be housed when they become single occupants as their family members move out or die.<\/p><p>It is as simple as that.  We have no strategic policy and, therefore, have large numbers of elderly people living alone in houses which are no longer suitable for their needs.  When looking at planning, investment, house design and community design, that particular future-proofing issue should be taken into account.  It would save us many challenges in the years ahead in terms of trying to adapt housing and moving people from large houses to smaller houses.  It would be done in a more structured manner.  I urge the Government to examine the area.<\/p> <p> Finally, I will be slightly parochial but for a national reason.  The Taoiseach came to Cork last week and announced the completion of the M20 from Limerick to Cork but the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, also came to Cork and announced a convention centre some time ago.  However, all that is there is a few pallets with a bit of sand on top of them.  A year and a half later, there is nothing else there.  On the same day, the first sod was turned on The Capitol development and that is now completely built and fully occupied but not a stone has been laid on top of another at the convention centre site.  There is, therefore, sometimes a jaundiced view of these particular announcements.  However, I urge that the north ring road in Cork, linking the Dublin road with the south ring road on to Killarney, and the M20 would be seen as strategic investment that would counterbalance the growth in Dublin.  The three university cities of Galway, Limerick and Cork, with an international airport, a large airport into Europe and a critical mass of people could sustain economic growth and act as a counterbalance.  I, therefore, urge the Government to examine that from the point of view of investment in the south west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600044#TT01900","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1509033000,"counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600045#UU00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1509033000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Dooley, I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Joan Burton and Billy Kelleher - the contingency plans in place for a flu outbreak; (2) Deputies Imelda Munster, James Lawless and Br&iacute;d Smith - the ongoing industrial relations issues in Irish Rail and Bus &Eacute;ireann; (3) Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v - an g&aacute; at&aacute; ann go gcuirfear airgead pr&aacute;inneach ar f&aacute;il le caoi a chur ar Bh&oacute;thar Dhoire Fhearta, An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, Contae na Gaillimhe; (4) Deputy Thomas Byrne - the ongoing disruption in Bus &Eacute;ireann service in the eastern region; (5) Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher - the proposal to introduce penalty points for fishery offences; (6) Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin - the status of the day care centre in Monasterevin, County Kildare; (7) Deputy Niamh Smyth - to address delays in ambulance response times in Cavan-Monaghan; (8) Deputy Aindrias Moynihan - the status of a new secondary school for De La Salle College, Macroom, County Cork; (9) Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin - to discuss the Traveller community national survey review; (10) Deputy Louise O'Reilly - the need to discuss improvements in the accommodation for St. Molaga's school, Balbriggan; (11) Deputy Noel Rock - the shortage of supply of substitute teachers in primary level education; and (12) Deputy Brian Stanley - the reduction in services at Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Joan Burton and Billy Kelleher, Brian Stanley, Imelda Munster, James Lawless and Br&iacute;d Smith, and &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600045#UU00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Planning Framework: Statements (Resumed)","time":1509033000,"counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600045#UU00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1509033000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the national planning framework that was issued on 28 September and puts in place a new national and regional development strategy for Ireland.

If we have learned anything from the crisis, however, it is the necessity for greater political input in long-term strategies and thinking.  The fact that Members are having this discussion at the tail end of the week's business, when other Deputies have already left, demonstrates that we are not putting it centre stage, which is a sad reflection.  We spoke in recent days of the way in which bankers have gone back to form and how, to some extent, no lessons have been learned.  I am sure there are those who would suggest that elements of this House, notwithstanding the new arrangements, have, in not putting something as important as this centre stage, gone back to type and form.<\/p><p>The draft document contains a strategy that is east coast-centric.  I do not come in here just as a representative of the west of Ireland.  I try in all circumstances to consider what is in the best interests of the country.  Given the way in which the numbers have been presented, we will see the east coast region continue to grow more rapidly than I think is sustainable and in a way that does not assist the development and creation of a counter-pole to that development.  The framework breaks the country into three new regions, namely, the northern and western region, which is made up of counties Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo, Donegal, Mayo and Galway; the southern region, which is made up of counties Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork, Tipperary, Kerry, Limerick and Clare; and then the eastern and midland, region comprising counties Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare, Meath, Louth, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford.  The draft document forecasts that the northern and western and southern regions combined should grow at broadly comparable rates to the eastern and midland region.  That is not an effective strategy in terms of balanced regional development, to which I think all parties in this House subscribe.  However, there is a difference between subscribing to the principle and delivering it.  The framework proposes that the five cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will be targeted to accommodate 50% of overall national growth between them, with a population growth target of 52,000 allocated to Limerick city, which is a central piece of the infrastructure of the mid-west region.<\/p><p>A deeper dive into these statistics would, instead of giving reassurance that the economic imbalance will be addressed, give rise to the belief that the <i>status quo<\/i>of the greater Dublin area significantly outpacing the rest of the economy is going unchecked.  The national planning framework, NPF, fails to give an accurate projected population breakdown.  It assesses the population across regions rather than applying a more precise breakdown as per the national spatial strategy or, better still, on a county-by-county basis.  I can only assume this is because the use of this three-region make-up, not least the eastern and midlands conglomerate, camouflages the true extent of the regional economic and investment disparity that is set to be created under this new plan.  Projected population growth is a key indicator as to where infrastructure spend goes and, with the national planning framework, we are somehow expected to buy into commonality across a region that includes counties Dublin and Longford.  The inclusion of counties Wexford and Clare in the same region - or counties Mayo and Cavan - suggests there is some shared infrastructure requirement.<\/p><p>If one were to take population growth trends from previous censuses to try and distil where exactly the population growth will happen in the key region - eastern and midlands - it would suggest that almost 85% of the 500,000 or so that this region&rsquo;s expected population growth by 2040 will take place in counties Dublin, Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  Using the same trends, while Dublin will be gaining 250,000 people, Longford would benefit to the tune of approximately 5,000.  The NPF tells us that Dublin&rsquo;s population equates to that of the next 40 cities and towns combined and it would appear that this will, if anything, be exacerbated.  It also tells us that Ireland 2040 is based on an ESRI projection.  If that is the case, it gives rise to further concern, as an ESRI study, for example, carried out for NAMA in 2014 looked at the estimated annual average increase in the number of households from 2011 to 2021 and 86% of the anticipated housing stock needed was accounted for by counties Dublin, Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.<\/p><p>This report is a deliberate attempt to confuse and cloud the reality of its intentions, which is to facilitate continued economic imbalance that is going to leave regions such as the mid-west, west and north west lagging further behind and making Dublin more uncompetitive, chaotic and congested for its citizens.  It singularly fails to capitalise on the clear opportunity of transforming these regions into dynamic economic powerhouses to ease the pressure on Dublin.  It is unimaginative and uninspired.<\/p><p>On specific NPF shortcomings from a mid-west perspective, which is central to my constituency, key future growth enablers were omitted in this draft.  Take, for example, Shannon Airport.  While there is a &quot;High Quality International Connectivity&quot; section which references Shannon as being among the main airports, along with those of Cork, Dublin and Knock, the only recommendations are for Dublin Airport, namely, the development of additional runway and terminal facilities such as the second runway for Dublin Airport for which planning permission has been approved.  Equally, it refers to &quot;Enhancing land-side access and particularly in public transport terms such as through the Metro-North project in Dublin&quot;.<\/p><p>What it does not refer to in any way is the importance of Shannon Airport in attracting foreign direct investment, FDI, and tourism to County Clare and the mid-west.  More than 40% of FDI from the United States is located within the catchment of Shannon Airport, which clearly reflects the airport's strategic value to the national economy.  In the context of the 16 FDI announcements in the mid-west region last year, all of the companies involved specifically noted Shannon Airport as a key factor in their investment decisions.  If we want regions outside Dublin to realise their potential, the national planning framework must recognise the need to fully utilise these State assets.  It is in the national interest to do so.<\/p> <p> In the past ten years, Dublin Airport has experienced unprecedented growth, with its market share increasing from 73% in 2006 to 85% in 2016.  Conversely, Shannon and Cork airports' market share plummeted in the same period.  Cork Airport's market share declined from 10% in 2006 to 6% in 2017, while Shannon Airport's market share declined from 13% to 5% in the same period.  Shannon Airport has an annual capacity of 4.5 million passengers, while Cork Airport has capacity for close to 3 million passengers.  Both airports are, therefore, well capable of alleviating the current pressure on Dublin Airport.  If both were to prosper, it would also trigger regional economic prosperity.<\/p> <p> The national planning framework should recognise the importance of growing business parks such as the Shannon free zone.  It must also address policy support for the Limerick northern distributor road, the development of which will enable the city to grow on the northern half, thereby improving access to the University of Limerick, the IDA Ireland national technology park, Shannon International Airport and businesses and industries in the Shannon area.  From my perusal of the document, however, no reference is made to this project, the benefits of which would significantly enhance the attractiveness of the region from a research, innovation and development perspective.<\/p> <p> The national planning framework proposes a faster rail link between Dublin and Cork but fails to recognise that Limerick and the mid-west region also require a faster rail link.  This is an unfortunate development.  I recently spoke to the European Commissioner for Transport, Ms Violeta Bulc.  The Commission has been promoting connectivity between cities and regions through high-speed rail links.  It is clear that, as demand and activity at Dublin Airport continue to grow, further terminal and runway space will be required.  Rather than having a third runway at the airport, which will definitely be on the agenda as soon as a second runway is built, we should consider the redundant capacity at Shannon and Cork airports and develop high-speed rail connections between these cities and Dublin.  This would deliver better utilisation of the airports and Cork, Limerick and the surrounding regions would benefit immensely from a high-speed rail link with the capital.  While we all recognise the importance of having appropriate funding and infrastructure for Dublin, the plan can also allow other cities and regions to thrive and prosper.  The missing piece is to provide high-speed links between these cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600045#UU00700","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509033600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>In recent years, citizens, communities and businesses have been living with the legacy of a failure of policy on spatial planning at national, regional and local level.  While progress has been made, it has been patchy and in some cases wasteful of scarce resources.  A number of steps must be taken urgently, one of which is to reform the planning system to meet the new challenges we face.  The Government must show real ambition in infrastructural investment and access funds for public private partnerships to ensure that whatever form the national planning framework eventually takes, it is backed up by genuine resources.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of procurement must also be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I was shocked to learn recently that the procurement process for vital infrastructure, including housing, takes up to two years to complete.  If this is not a crisis, I do not know what is. <\/p>  <p>  To be effective, the national planning framework must be placed at the top of the hierarchy of plans and its goals must be reflected throughout the planning process, down to local area plans.  We cannot overestimate the importance of having a proper, sustainable, practical and ambitious planning framework statement.  This statement should and will guide the future development of the country, taking into account a projected increase in population and the need to create more jobs, achieve full employment and provide more homes, schools and hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  I note that 25% of the projected increase in the population will be in Dublin.  It is appropriate that Dublin should be recognised as the key international city of scale and the principal driver of economic growth.  However, this presents a major problem for surrounding counties, particularly Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.  All too often, these counties are dragged into the larger Dublin metropolitan area and it is forgotten that they have their own needs.  They also have much to offer and they deserve to be able to build on this.  They must be treated as areas in their own right.  It is projected that 50% of growth outside Dublin will be in key regional centres, which is appropriate, and regional plans must be drawn up to address this issue. <\/p>  <p>  County Kildare is home to the Defence Forces' headquarters and a large part of the horse industry.  It is known as the thoroughbred country and is recognised both here and abroad as the premier county for horse-breeding, training and racing.  Kildare is also home to Bord na M&oacute;na and people in the county are very proud of where they live.  The county has a mix of urban and rural areas and we will fight hard to ensure this continues to be the case.<\/p>  <p>  There is a perception that County Kildare is wealthy.  Just today, one of my colleagues spoke about the lovely main roads that run through the county.  All too often, people traversing its main roads en route to other counties do not see the heartland of Kildare.  We need substantial investment in our roads.  The county has 2,528 km of road, for which we had a budget of &euro;18 million for maintenance this year.  This is not nearly sufficient.  To cite an example, subsidence on Coughlanstown Road, which runs between Ballymore Eustace and Kilcullen, cut off a vital artery between these two rural towns 13 months ago.  It would cost &euro;4 million to repair the road.  I have spoken to the Minister about this case on several occasions and he gave a commitment to meet the local community, although no such meeting has taken place.  The Department repeatedly states that Kildare County Council must find, from its own resources, the funding required to rebuild the road.  This is practically impossible as it would require almost 25% of the county's annual budget for 2,528 km of road.  Meanwhile, the local school and businesses are suffering.  For example, people living 500 m. from the school must drive 9 km to reach it.  Issues such as this must be addressed in the national planning framework.<\/p>  <p>  Two weeks ago, we learned that planning approval had been granted for the southern distributor road in Athy.  This is a very welcome decision as this is an extremely important project.  However, the Government has not yet provided the funding of &euro;35 million required to complete the project, which will provide a vital lifeline for the town.  Recently, I facilitated a meeting in Athy with representatives of IDA Ireland who highlighted this project as one of the issues that would help deliver jobs to the town.  I remind the House that Athy is an unemployment black spot, with a 35% unemployment rate among a certain age cohort.  This issue must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Closer to home, Newbridge needs funding for its link road.  Almost all Deputies are familiar with Newbridge, which is a fine town.  However, despite the rapid growth in its population, which currently stands at almost 30,000, the town can only be accessed by one road which crosses a bridge.<\/p><p>Every county development plan we have had over the past 50 years has signified the intention and aspiration to build another bridge and to have other roads coming into our town.  This has never happened and there are no plans for it to happen, but it is a priority for our county and something I certainly would like to see addressed in the final plan.  <\/p> <p> Kildare has the lowest level of provision across a range of service levels.  It has the highest number of young people under the age of 24 in the country so there is huge need for youth facilities and amenity lands.  I have spoken about the challenges we have as a county with urban areas and a constituency with towns like Newbridge, Kildare and Athy, but small towns and villages like Monasterevin, Rathangan, Castledermot, Athgarvan, Milltown, Allenwood, Derrinturn and Carbury deserve support and proper linkages.  Earlier this morning, I met with Local Link Kildare, which has great capacity to address some of the transport issues we face.  If it had a third extra funding, it would be able to run that service from 8 a.m. to midnight, thereby promoting connectivity, which is hugely important.  A total of 50% of the population in Kildare that is working does so outside the county, many of them in Dublin.  Unfortunately, while we have a good train service in three of our towns, it still leaves a lot to be desired, particularly around pricing.  I met with the NTA yesterday to discuss this issue.  Unfortunately, we are pushing too many people into cars.  Surely we must get away from that.  <\/p> <p> We need to improve the lives of those working and living in our rural communities.  We need to ensure the success of vibrant rural communities across my county and the rest of the country.  This means supporting the creation of jobs, bringing high-speed broadband, which is crucial, to every home and business and revitalising our towns and villages.  We need strategies that will support and empower our citizens in their local towns, villages and environs to build on their strengths.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to our counties and towns.  We have a diverse and varied country.  We need innovation and to be able to support indigenous enterprise.  We need to both encourage indigenous enterprise and increase FDI, including pilot schemes in our areas.  Much needs to be done and a good deal of consultation needs to carried out.  I support my colleagues in saying that the deadline for submissions needs to be extended so that we can consult with the people who live in the areas that will be impacted by this plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600046#VV00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509034200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>The national planning framework will mean little if it is not backed up by co-ordinated capital investment and implementation across each tier of governance from local government upwards.  I welcome this opportunity to talk about the national planning framework with regard to my constituency of Waterford and the south-east region.  Despite the improving economy in the country, Waterford and the south east continue to have the highest unemployment figures in the State.  The figures remain stubbornly high at 8.5%, including the counties of Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary and Wexford.  The average rate of unemployment throughout the rest of the country is 6.1%.  The ambition set out by the Government to reduce the joblessness rate to within 1% of the national rate is still more aspirational than achievable.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, a fantastic opportunity has presented itself for Waterford through the hard work and efforts of Waterford City and County Council under the leadership of CEO Michael Walsh.  The proposed investment in Waterford city by the Alhokair Group from Saudi Arabia has provided a much-needed confidence boost for the city of Waterford and indeed the whole south east.  The proposed development at a cost of &euro;300 million will be a game changer for Waterford.  The south east absolutely needs a regional city of consequence and that must be Waterford.  It must be enabled for propulsive growth.  For regions to be strong regions, they need a strong city.  Being closest to Dublin with a very impressive road network, Waterford must be enabled to be an alternative to Dublin.  Encouraging the growth of population in Waterford and the south east will act as a release for Dublin's overheating issues regarding housing, transport congestion and education.<\/p>  <p>  The North Quays is a project of strategic importance to Waterford and the region and the development of the Michael Street shopping centre is also very significant.  The region requires the capital to be assigned to it in light of the fantastic opportunity we have been offered.  The proposed development has the clear potential to give Waterford and the south-east region the emphasis it needs to produce additional, permanent services such as health care, education and transport and will result in an enhanced economy overall.  The proposed development will happen on 8.25 ha of substantial and spectacular river frontage.  The proposal includes 30,000 sq. m of retail space, 15,000 sq. m of hotel and conference space and 30,000 sq. m of residential space.  The residential space is expected to include 300 units, of which 100 will be owned by Waterford City and County Council, which will immediately result in a reduction in the already extremely high local authority waiting list.  The proposal also includes a significant pedestrian bridge which will be a focal point linking the North Quays with the city.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal also includes the relocation of Plunkett railway station and the relocation of Waterford Crystal Visitor Centre.  It is estimated that 1,000 jobs will be created during the construction phase and a further 2,300 permanent jobs will be created on completion in the various industries and services, including retail, tourism and knowledge-based enterprise.  The draft plans for this hugely significant development are now on view for the public, which will transform the way we are viewed and how we could be seen as a regional city of importance and significance, the economic driver of the south east, and our rightful position as Ireland's oldest city.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed North Quays development has the potential to kick-start the economic recovery in the south east.  The Alhokair Group is coming to the table with &euro;220 million and the local authority is proposing between &euro;5 and &euro;10 million, while the shortfall of &euro;61.5 million will have to come from Government funds and State investment.  The city and county council has done an amazing job in getting the project to the current stage.  We now need to see how seriously the Government views promoting regional economic development.  The city and county council has applied to the Government for this significant funding to advance this proposal.  However, it is very important to state that it will be extremely unlikely that this project will get over the line without State funding.  The employment and housing opportunities cannot be under-estimated.  This is an opportunity of a lifetime and a generation and cannot be seen as a missed opportunity.  Cork and Limerick are seeing massive investment in their city centres.  Waterford cannot be the bridesmaid any more.  I am calling on the Government to step up to the plate and show Waterford that it cares about its economic future and provide the capital investment to let this project commence.  <\/p>  <p>  An independent report was recently prepared for Waterford City and County Council by INDECON International Economic Consultants and the conclusions raised are extremely positive.  INDECON's assessment highlights the significant potential economic benefits offered by the Waterford redevelopment project.  This reflects the role of the project in assisting Waterford to realise its potential to develop as a regional driver of economic growth.  It should be noted that the benefits will only be achieved if the proposed private sector investments are made and will require initiatives to ensure that Waterford capitalises on the opportunities arising from the Ancient East tourism initiative.  Other supporting actions must be taken to develop the region as an attractive competitive location for foreign and indigenous investment.<\/p><p> The proposed major development plans for Waterford would bring the city in line other Irish cities and signal to international investors that the city and region is open for business.  Indecon&rsquo;s independent analysis indicates the proposed investment would provide a net benefit to society in socio-economic terms.  The recent opening of the fantastic greenway of 46 km which links Dungarvan and Waterford has already been a game-changer for Waterford city and county.  This fantastic amenity of off-road cycling and walking trail along the old railway track is a beautiful journey amid beautiful scenery between the sea and the mountains in parts.  The success of the greenway has been unprecedented with visitor figures bearing this out.  The village of Kilmacthomas has been rejuvenated, with small businesses opening, employment opportunities and a general feeling of optimism, which we have not seen in a while.  Dungarvan, our county town, has never been busier with hotels and restaurants showing a marked increase in business.  The spin-off has been truly phenomenal.<\/p> <p> Waterford needs this opportunity and university status for WIT would be a game-changer.  That is why I asked the Minister for Education and Skills about the Technological Universities Bill.  It is essential the Bill comes before the House as soon as possible.  To have a technological university for the south east will be a game-changer.  Waterford is the economic driver of the south east.  It is imperative we get this up and running.<\/p> <p> Waterford city has been constrained in its growth by an absence of key infrastructure particularly in respect of its river crossings and city centre access.  As a consequence its development has been compromised leading to a less sustainable city centre which is not delivering on its economic potential.  The city is transforming from a historical manufacturing and port city to one where advanced manufacturing and knowledge-based industries can marry with a significantly enhanced service sector, particularly in tourism and retail, to deliver an urban centre that can be a real driver for regional development and a centre of consequence in the national picture.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the future of Waterford and the south east, our economic and regional future and include this investment in the national planning framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600047#WW00200","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509034800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I am glad we have had this opportunity.  We are talking about a national framework plan but I am going to be parochial about it and I make no apology for that.  I have a diagram in front of me which shows the motorways across the island of Ireland.  It makes very poor reading for counties such as Cavan and Monaghan which have lagged behind when it comes to motorways and infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  There are many issues that need to be addressed particularly for rural areas and Border counties such as Cavan and Monaghan.  We face many challenges, such as depopulation in west Cavan, deficiencies in broadband throughout the constituency, deficiencies in the road networks and the absolute need to open up the Ulster Canal and its potential for tourism in the Border region.  After listening to my colleague, Deputy Mary Butler, I am almost jealous of the fantastic way she has described Waterford today.  I am afraid we are less than the bridesmaid in terms of the type of tourism facilities she talked about, which is a result of lack of investment.<\/p>  <p>  Access to County Cavan is abysmal.  The N3 ends at the Cavan-Meath border.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State that because he knows it himself.  Former Minister, Noel Dempsey, was phenomenal in leading the charge on that motorway but unfortunately it ended at the Cavan border.  It is as if we are the forgotten county.  We have no motorway into Cavan town and continual traffic congestion in Virginia, which is stifling the growth of business throughout the county and does not provide the infrastructure that is so badly needed to encourage businesses throughout.  It speaks volumes about the political will to invest in County Cavan.  We are all the time being told by the IDA we do not have the infrastructure in place to attract what foreign companies are looking for when they are considering a location to invest in.  That is evident in the number of IDA visits we have to both Cavan and Monaghan on an annual basis.  We are talking single figure numbers; it could be one or two visits, perhaps three at most.<\/p>  <p>  We need motorway status for the N2.  We have seen far too many road fatalities and we need to see it upgraded to motorway status.  More than ever there is a very strong case for the A5-N2 project.  The project has the potential to unlock future economic development for Monaghan and Cavan, creating an immediate burst of employment with an estimated 1,000 jobs in the construction sector.  The east-west link motorway is stuck at design stage.  We need to see real action and a real commitment to putting funding in place for the east-west link corridor which is critical when we consider the motorways in Ireland.  The visual aid I have with me shows clearly that all motorways leaving Dublin go to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  When one stops at Galway city and looks at this map, one sees that from Galway right across the north west and right up to Belfast there is not one motorway in sight.  We are completely the forgotten half of this island.  It would take very little in the grand scheme of things to invest in a motorway to Cavan or Monaghan town and bring some fairness and equity to the people living in the north west.  The NPF must take a balanced regional perspective on the future development of the country.  This means developing economic counterweights to the increasing dominance of Dublin.  In applied terms, the aim of the NPF should be to enable growth across all regions while reducing regional disparities.  While there have been criticisms that the concept of balanced regional development is too diffuse, we believe the concept of reducing regional economic disparities while not hindering across-the-nation growth is well-defined and measurable.  In practice, it means achieving growth in all areas by attempting to reduce the share of national growth concentrated in high growth areas, such as the greater Dublin area.  I am quite serious when I talk about regions such as west Cavan where we have seen a brain drain.  There are no young people living there.  They have no broadband or road access.  The issue of depopulation in counties must seriously be looked at and west Cavan must be seriously considered when we are considering all of that.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit further underlines the importance of developing an all-island approach to long-term planning.  The island is acutely exposed to the hard edge of Brexit and needs to be able to work together to mitigate its worst ramifications.  The NPF must work in tandem with the regional development strategy 2035 which charts the path forward for Northern Ireland.  Aligning with spatial plans for Northern Ireland and utilising the institutional framework established by the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent documents will be vital to leveraging fully the overall potential for the whole island.  The decision by Britain to exit the EU has consequences for the flow of goods, services and people on the island between what would then be a member state and a non-EU member state.  The debate and discussions about the impact of Brexit on the island focuses on Border arrangements that might be introduced as a consequence.  Traffic going across the Border needs good access points and there is a real opportunity here both with the N2-A5 project and by continuing the N3 motorway.  The Minister of State should not miss this opportunity for balanced regional development.  I implore him to make decisions that positively discriminate in favour of rural Ireland and stop the growth of a two-tier society.<\/p>  <p>  The NPF should set out to strike a balance between delivering a strategic plan for Ireland over the next 20 years while also fostering the potential of places and the ambition of people.  Central to achieving this balance is political will and ownership at local, regional and national level to allow places of varying sizes to complement rather than compete with each other.  The national planning framework will mean little if it is not backed up by co-ordinated capital investment and implementation across each tier of governance from local government upwards.  Aspirations for broadening out population increases and economic growth will only be achieved through a holistic approach.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We call for a national infrastructure commission and a clear hierarchy of plans to implement the NPF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600048#XX00200","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1509035400,"counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600049#YY00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1509035400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>As Deputy Cowen is not yet present, we will move to Question No. 2 and come back to No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600049#YY00500","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","time":1509035400,"counter":327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600049#YY00600"},{"type":"question","time":1509035400,"counter":328,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[45427\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600049#YY00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the target number of affordable units (details supplied) to be delivered in 2018 via the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, and the forthcoming affordable housing scheme.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1509035400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>This question centres on the need for affordable housing.

The Minister seems to be suggesting there may be - possibly outside Dublin, possibly through LIHAF, possibly through the new housing finance initiative - some properties at the very top end of that; although he cannot confirm that yet.  There has to be a spread of properties in the range between &euro;170,000 and &euro;288,000 next year, the following year and the year after that.

It was given a budget of &euro;57.1 million to achieve that.  That is the money Tipperary was given to spend on housing and so far it has reached about 715 homes under that target and we expect it to reach the 832 units before the end of the year because that is the target set out.  We will do all we can to work with the local authorities in the months ahead to achieve that.  The funding set aside is for a combination of bringing back in voids, acquiring vacant properties, acquisitions and so on, as well as building new houses, and that is what has been achieved so far.

The council is under fierce pressure with the homelessness crisis and dealing with HAP.  There are voids all over the place.  They have been there for five and six years and the same is true in the Minister of State's county too.  There is a lot of dysfunctionality somewhere in the system.  Money is being announced.

I do not mean like calling the banks for tea and sweet cake.  The Government should just say we want action here.  We want the people housed.  We want some kind of functionality in the building industry and the knock-on effect on the economy as well, apart altogether from the unfortunate people waiting for houses for 12 and 15 years.  There are over 3,000 people waiting in Tipperary, approved applicants, not to mention all the people who are not approved.

The Government decided that 80% of the estimated LPT liability in each local authority area\u00a0for a given year is retained in that area to fund public services, notwithstanding any local variation decisions.  The remaining 20% of LPT is redistributed to provide equalisation funding to\u00a0those local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values and density across the State.  This reflects the fact that local authorities vary significantly in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with decisions taken by the Government regarding the distribution of local property tax, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it known as the baseline.  There are variances across the country in terms of LPT levels but it is important that all local authorities receive at least this baseline level of funding to ensure they can deliver services.  Following consideration by my Department, the baseline was last revised in respect of the 2017 local property tax allocations.  For 2017 onwards, an adjustment was made to the baseline of each local authority to include an additional amount equivalent to the pension-related deduction, PRD, income retained by local authorities in 2014.  This administrative arrangement was designed to reduce the risk to local government funding that would otherwise arise from declining PRD income from 2016 onwards.  Therefore, the baseline is currently linked to previous general purpose grant amounts and the level of pension-related deductions retained by local authorities in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance has overall responsibility for\u00a0LPT policy and accordingly, questions around\u00a0such policies\u00a0are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  My Department remains focused on the resource needs of all local authorities.  The issue of baselines is one that is raised a great deal with Department officials when they visit local authorities.  Most local authorities are happy with the change made in regard to the pension-related deduction.

Taking the two counties of Wicklow and Mayo, the population of Wicklow is greater than that of Mayo by 12,000.  The baseline for Wicklow is &euro;6.84 million and the baseline for Mayo is &euro;17 million, even though the population of Mayo is smaller.  The overall spend in Mayo when everything is taken into consideration is &euro;125 million.  In Wicklow, it is &euro;91 million.  This means the larger populated area has the smaller amount of funding.  These baselines date back to the needs and resources model of 2001 and have only been tweaked since.  I am aware of the change that occurred last year in regard to the pension-related deduction.  It was not about addressing the baselines in the sense I am talking about.  Unless population changes matter, growing areas will lose out in terms of the opportunity cost in respect of services that they should be providing.  This will result in significant resentments.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure this issue is looked at in the context of any review.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the local property tax, this tax essentially was a replacement for the general purposes grants.

As the Deputy knows, the original needs resource model was cumbersome to manage and it did not always prove economical to gather all of the relevant data.  The issue of the funding requirements of local authorities is an ongoing one for the Department.  The Deputy will be familiar with the requirements of the local authority in her area, as I am familiar with the needs of the local authority in my county.  There is increased pressure on services when there is an increase in population.  Local authorities currently do a lot more than they did previously.  The local property tax is only part of the funding provided to local authorities.  They also get other funding.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to Mayo versus Wicklow, this is not only about population size.

The 2005 figures were taken from the 2001 data and they were only marginally changed.  I have the data for each year from 2001 onwards.  The issue is that when the needs and resources model was brought in, a commitment was given that no county would lose out under the new funding mechanism.  The problem is that growing areas will always lose out in that environment.  A local authority which had a large staff and assets such as libraries or swimming pools at that point could count them as a need but the capacity to develop new services or grow the workforce was not factored into how the metric worked.  There is a significant fault at the heart of this funding model, which if not reviewed will work to the disadvantage of some areas.  The operation of the equalisation fund means counties that are growing are paying in more and more, which means the baseline will work to their disadvantage in terms of discretionary spend.

We are very conscious of the great differences between them.  In accordance with Government decisions on local retention of the local property tax, certain local authorities with large property bases receive additional income from the local property tax compared with their baseline.  The Government decided that these local authorities would use this surplus funding in two ways: a proportion of it would be available for their own use and the remainder to fund some services in the housing and roads areas.  This process is known as self-funding, replacing central executive funding as well.  Approximately &euro;108 million from the local property tax is supporting housing and road services in 2018.  We do allow for this in the counties that are growing quicker than others in terms of their property base.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's statement earlier that people are beginning to realise that the local property tax is being used to plug a gap, people were always aware of what it was to be used for.  I repeatedly said that it was a great shame that the local property tax was introduced at a time when resources nationally had to be cut across the board.  There is great benefit in having a local property tax, although people do not see that at this point because of the timing of its introduction.  As things improve, they will be able to link improvements to it.  In the early years, it was used to plug the gap in national funding.  There is no denying of this and it is a great shame.  One of my first suggestions on being elected to this House was that we should bring in a local property tax.  At that stage, Bertie Ahern and others were focused on tax reductions without putting in place a local property tax.  They should have done a combination of both.  We would be in a much better place had we done that.

A budget of &euro;6 billion has been secured to fund housing projects, in the main, social housing, but also to open up sites for housing in general.

My Department facilitated a workshop for local authorities in July of this year to commence this process.  Once all the plans have been reviewed and finalised, they will be made available publicly on the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland website, as well as the website of the relevant local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Utilising rapid build and other innovative construction technologies can accelerate housing provision as timeframes are considerably shorter than for traditional build.

However, there is another issue, as I see it.  There is a multiplicity of housing bodies - voluntary bodies, approved housing bodies, charitable bodies - all vying with one another to supply the housing market.  To my mind, they are competing and obstructing one another because they are in the same place at the same time, increasing the cost of housing because they are competing in the same market, hence the necessity to produce a plan that is short-term, that is rapid in its delivery and that the local authorities recognise.  The local authorities could then identify a specific number by which they propose to address the housing need in their respective local authority areas, as opposed to the general, broad-brushstroke approach that has been applied.  It should be recognised that this is to address a housing deficit that goes back about 15 years.  I believe there is a terrible reluctance to resolve the deficit and go back to direct build and provision of local authority houses on the one hand for people on local authority lists and, on the other, people in lower income groups who ordinarily were able to acquire private sites, developed sites, subsidised sites and local authority loans, all of which have disappeared in recent times.  This is what I feel we need to emphasise and target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600054#DDD01000","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1509038400,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy's contribution.  He is correct to talk about a multiplicity of housing bodies in this country.  We have hundreds of them.  They operate at different tiers - tiers 1, 2 and 3 - tier 3 comprising the housing bodies that operate at a significant scale, that is, at the kind of scale we would like to see, although we would like them to do more, as housing bodies in other jurisdictions do.  Later this month we will move to begin taking the voluntary regulation of the sector onto a statutory footing.  In that process we hope to be able to entice larger housing bodies from abroad into this jurisdiction.  We also hope some housing bodies will come together and work together.  One of the changes we made as a result of the housing summit earlier this year - and the Deputy is right to point this out - is that local authorities will no longer compete with first-time house buyers and families looking to buy homes in high-demand areas.  They will take that money and put it into building.  That is important.  If a local authority is not going to be competing with other householders, it does not make sense that housing bodies would compete with one another either.  This is why it is important we have these managed plans for each site, per each local authority.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, is responsible for working with the local authorities on each of these plans, which are being submitted to us at present, for each piece of land they have and the targets they have into 2018 and beyond so we can see how units will be built.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding rapid build, there is a very quick turnaround time.  My Department can give approval on the funding side within 24 hours.  Then there can be a tendering process within four weeks and the house can be completed on site within six months of that process.  One of the interesting things happening at present is that Dublin City Council has for the first time brought forward a multi-unit rapid framework.  It hopes to deliver 600 apartments through rapid build.  If this Dublin City Council project bears fruit, if it is successful and if it works to the timelines as envisaged, it will allow other local authorities to move in a similar vein and further increase our ambition for social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600054#DDD01100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1509038400,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's ambitious plans and I have no doubt but that he will see them through, and it is in everyone's interest that he does so.  Each local authority, with particular reference to the numbers on the local authority housing waiting lists, needs to be asked the simple question, how quickly can it deliver, and how many units can it deliver in the shortest possible time?  The six-month period is a great idea.  That is what we need.  All the discussions I have had with local authorities - and I am sure my colleagues on all sides of the House have had similar discussions - are vague, and they say it will take two or three years before units are built.  This problem is now, not in two or three years' time.  Every effort needs to be put into achieving the targets in the shortest possible time, and I know the Minister will ensure that.  It will have a dual benefit in that it will reduce the pressure on people who do not own their homes, homeless people in particular, and it will reduce the price of houses generally.

The Minister is trying to put a positive spin on it to say that in Dublin for two months in a row the number of families has decreased.  The Minister is right.  It decreased by 32 families from July to August and by eight families from August to September.  I welcome that decrease.

The trend in numbers increasing nationally is up, but it is up at a slower percent of increase than it was in the three months previous to the last three months.  That is some progress and I believe it is important too.  No one is happy with the numbers of people who are homeless or the number of families in emergency accommodation but the Government is working with local authorities, NGOs, the voluntary sector, religious organisations and individual citizens to try to help these people into sustainable, secure homes.

This draft scheme is currently subject to public consultation, which will conclude very shortly on 3 November 2017.

The mixed tenure is, of course, very important to everything we are trying to achieve as a Government.  On foot of a material amendment, 900, or nearly 26%, of the 3,500 new homes on the SDZ lands will be delivered as social and affordable houses.  It was looking at a 10% or 15% mix within that, but of the 15% affordable housing it might be more appropriate to deliver some of those as social housing, especially for older people.  Again, as we build homes we must ensure that we protect and regenerate new communities.  It is intended that an agreement for those additional 550 new homes, with confirmed funding, would be entered into between the city council, the receiver and my Department prior to the commencement of the development, the majority of which will be earmarked for affordable housing with some for social housing.

Therefore, it offers families more security and allows them to plan for their future.\u00a0 HAP will continue to be a flexible support available to assist people with their long-term housing needs immediately as their need arises.  There are currently more than 28,500 households and 20,000 landlords and agents taking part in the scheme.  On average, more than 350 households have been set up\u00a0on HAP each week in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that concerns have been expressed regarding the availability of sufficient rental properties to achieve the level of ambition set out for HAP.  From experience, about one third of new households receiving HAP for the first time have transferred from rent supplement in an existing tenancy; another third are households who were not in receipt of rent supplement and so are receiving financial support for the first time and are in an existing tenancy; and the last third are households who are also receiving financial support for the first time, but are moving into a new tenancy with the help of HAP support.  This means that two thirds of HAP tenants are being supported within existing tenancies, while one third, or roughly 100 per week, are using HAP to secure new accommodation that they are finding\u00a0on \u00a0the rental market.  Budget 2018 has increased Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme by &euro;149 million to &euro;301 million to meet the continuing costs of existing households and the costs of meeting the additional 17,000 households, to which the Deputy referred, targeted under Rebuilding Ireland, to be supported by HAP in 2018.

That is what is the HAP place finder is there for.  It is working and that is why we are expanding it outside Dublin, which I announced at the housing summit, to help people into accommodation.  As we have needed to make changes to the scheme, as we did during the year, including the roll-out of the place finder service outside Dublin and the introduction of homeless HAP, we have done so to make sure we can rely on the private rented sector until we get more homes built.  If the Deputy looks at the progress under Rebuilding Ireland until 2021, in the final years our reliance on HAP will be less than our reliance on direct builds, acquisitions and long-term leasing.

I, therefore, call on the Minister for Health to establish a single task force to deal with the possibility of a deadly combination of the two.  It also means that community care will be more important than ever this winter in order that the most vulnerable, in particular, will not have to attend hospitals and, preferably, will not need to stay in hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The national public health emergency team needs to be convened to deal with this risk.  We also need advice for families and people at home, institutions such as nursing homes and day care centres and all health care facilities.  Efforts need to be stepped up to ensure the message is getting through in the public information campaign on the anti-flu vaccine, in particular to health care workers and to those working with elderly people to ensure that as far as is possible they get the vaccine.  I have had the vaccine and while it does not give complete protection against the viral strain that appears to be coming from Australia, it will give significant protection.  It is vital that we have clear thinking about keeping all our health services open and functioning.

Professor Sir Malcolm Grant of the NHS recently said that they were preparing for a catastrophic flu strain arriving in the UK that could have huge implications for the delivery of health care.  If that is the case, we have to do the same.  The national public health emergency team met in response to the CPE super bug and the same response is required to prepare for the eventuality of a flu virus reaching Ireland, which a vaccine will not necessarily prevent.  We have to ask ourselves what we can do.  We should consider opening additional intensive care beds.  Isolation rooms will be critically important and community geriatricians and nurse specialists should be deployed in the community in order that elderly and vulnerable people who are primarily in the community care setting or nursing homes will not have to transferred into the acute hospital system through our emergency departments.  They are overcrowded and we can predict that there will be huge overcrowding problems during the Christmas period and especially in the first few weeks of January when there will be massive cancellations of elective surgery and major surgery for cancer patients and others who have been waiting an extraordinary time for scheduled surgery.

The Minister sends his apologies for not being able to be here.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware influenza can be a serious illness for people in at-risk groups and can lead to hospitalisation and death.  At-risk people include those aged 65 years and older, those with chronic illness requiring regular medical follow-up, those with lower immunity due to disease or treatment, pregnant women and residents of nursing homes and other long-stay facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The priority for this winter is to increase take-up of the influenza vaccine in at-risk groups and in health care workers to reduce and control the incidence of flu and outbreaks in the community and health care settings.  As Deputies will recall, the HSE launched its immunisation and Under the Weather campaigns for the 2017-2018 season earlier this month.  By reducing the incidence of influenza, we reduce the need for people to seek treatments and, consequently, reduce the demands on health services.  The HSE has put in place significant measures to ensure it is prepared for influenza this winter.  A national steering group is in place to co-ordinate the response.  Each hospital group and community health organisation has submitted a flu plan based on the evidence of last year&rsquo;s successes and areas for action over the oncoming season.  Each long-term care facility and private nursing home has received a detailed communication on how to prepare for and deal with flu.  Additionally, each hospital group and associated community health organisation were requested to produce a winter plan which includes a specific section on flu.  These plans were reviewed at a national meeting earlier this week.  The HSE must be commended on the preparations it has made for this winter.  Those preparations will significantly reduce the impact of influenza on the health services.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to address concerns relating to the effectiveness of the vaccine and the impact of influenza in other parts of the world.  The strain currently circulating in Australia is similar to the one which dominated in Ireland last winter and the vaccine for use in Ireland contains this strain of the virus and should afford protection.  The latest surveillance reports relating to Australia indicate that the peak week of national influenza activity was comparable or higher than in recent years.  However, clinical severity was low to moderate and the proportion of hospitalised patients admitted directly to intensive care units has been on the lower range reported in recent years.  These latest reports also indicated that the vaccine was a good match for the circulating flu strains.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, flu activity, as measured by influenza-like illness rates, is currently low, similar to other European countries.  While it is too early to comment definitively on the efficacy of the seasonal flu vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States have indicated that it is 50% to 60% effective in preventing hospitalisation in older people and 80% effective in preventing death in the elderly.  Also of note is that no particular concerns were expressed in relation to either the current flu season or vaccine effectiveness at the EU joint meeting of chief medical officers and chief veterinary officers on influenza preparedness earlier this week.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I remind Deputies that vaccination remains, as Deputy Burton said, the most effective means of preventing infection by seasonal influenza viruses.  We ask people to engage with the HSE's campaign of recent weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600059#JJJ00100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1509041400,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Critically, there is no reason anyone in a nursing home or who attends community care day centres, on a daily or weekly basis, should not be facilitated with the vaccine.  By and large, the people attending those centres are older.  Second, we have the more recent reports of the carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae, CPE, bug.  The HSE has acknowledged that it is extremely difficult to treat and already it has caused a significant number of deaths.  A combination of this bug in hospitals and vulnerable people, both older and younger, going into hospitals as inpatients means a much higher risk in terms of mortality in that those who are ill with flu can get pneumonia and are highly exposed to the risk of developing the CPE bug.  The HSE message is not being communicated sufficiently to people, including the HSE's own staff, where there seems to be a reluctance to get the vaccine.

The key component in all of our health services is front-line staff.  The HSE said that there has not been a great level of take-up.  One has to ask why the HSE is not being more informative to its own employees, who are at risk of infection and infecting.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that the immunisation programme for all these high-risk categories is rolled out in a robust way and that the HSE will engage with staff, through advocacy groups, unions and worker representatives, to ensure that there is a big take-up.

A stronger campaign is required.  The campaign was launched on 2 October, with an initial focus on health care workers.  The radio adverts, which will run for three weeks, commenced on 9 October and there will be a further two weeks of the radio adverts when the flu goes over the threshold.  Those aged 65 and over and pregnant women are the primary audience for the radio campaign, which will also reach medically at-risk groups and health care workers as they make up a more generic radio audience as well.  The trend is that increasing numbers of health care workers are availing of the vaccine, with the figure increasing from 22% last year to nearly 32%, although the figure is probably still not high enough.  Fourteen hospitals have exceeded the 40% national take-up target, compared to seven in 2015-2016.

A plan was to be released in September 2015 regarding the future of the hospital but we have not yet seen that plan.  However, there is a plan contained in what is described as the final draft of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group strategy for 2018 to 2013, which was given to me at the weekend.  Last night a public meeting on the matter was held and up to 400 people attended.  According to the letter sent with it, this plan was a final draft which was to be signed off on yesterday at a meeting of health managers at 2 p.m. in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  We now know what is in it but, unfortunately, what is in it is the end of emergency department services in Portlaoise.  There will be no more emergency treatment in Portlaoise and trauma cases are to bypass Naas.  The implications are serious.  It is one of the busiest emergency departments outside of Dublin, having dealt with almost 40,000 people last year.  The figure is further increasing this year, with more than 20,000 people in the first six months of the year using the unit.  Where are these people to go if there is no emergency department between Tallaght and Limerick?  Critically ill patients will be stuck in rush hour traffic on the N7.  The other morning it took me three hours and five minutes to get from my house to the D&aacute;il.  The N7 is chock-a-block and not for one hour at rush hour.  Rush hour now lasts for three hours in the morning and three hours in the evening.  It starts at 3 p.m. and sometimes is not finished until 7 p.m.  How does Susan O'Reilly think the 40,000 patients will be moved about?  Is it by helicopter?  Will there be fleets of helicopters?<\/p>  <p>  The meeting last night was attended by the public, hospital staff and consultants, and general practitioners.  They are the experts and they are absolutely adamant that this will not work.  There is no capacity in the system.  This will lead to the collapse of paediatrics and maternity services in Portlaoise, which is a huge concern.  Let me be clear that Dr. Fleming, a cardiologist in the hospital, said the problem is one of capacity and resources.  It is not a specialist problem.  This is the key point, and I want the Minister of State to take it on board.  Susan O'Reilly was put in there to do a job, but the Minister of State and I are her paymaster as are the public on the street and the citizens of County Laois and surrounding counties that depend on the hospital.  The Minister of State needs to get a grip on this issue.  Do not outsource this responsibility to her.  If she signed off on this yesterday, get it and put it in the shredder.<\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday, I raised the issue with the Government.<\/p><p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, who was standing in for the Taoiseach, informed me the Government had no intention of closing the emergency department in the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise.  Intentions can change, however.  The emergency department must not be closed and services must not be downgraded or reduced.  The proposals are unacceptable and unworkable.  We need a firm and clear commitment that the hospital will not be downgraded and its emergency department will not be closed.  We want a plan to upgrade the hospital.<\/p> <p> I have neighbours who work in the emergency department of Portlaoise hospital and I am in touch with other staff at the hospital.  I have also been in and out of the hospital with people over the years.  Staff are doing their level best and should get medals for the work they do.  Hospital managers all over the country, including in Portlaoise hospital, will tell the Minister that it is not possible to recruit and retain specialist staff without certainty.  We need certainty but more than two years have been spent messing around with these plans, which arose from a review announced by the previous Government in 2011.  Roscommon hospital was a casualty of that review and County Laois will not be another casualty.  These plans will not wash.

I assure the Deputy that, as the Minister stated previously, the most important issue with regard to consideration of services at the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise is that patient safety and outcomes must come first.  The Minister is committed to securing and further developing the role of the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, there have been a number of reports on the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise in recent years.  These reports have pointed to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff who can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.<\/p>  <p>  Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure that services currently provided that are not sustainable are discontinued and those that are sustainable are safety assured and adequately resourced.  The Health Service Executive has confirmed that hospital funding has increased by 28% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 29% from the 2014 base.  Funding of &euro;300,000 has also been provided in 2017 to facilitate the opening of the new medical assessment unit.  In addition, governance and management arrangements in Portlaoise hospital have been strengthened, additional clinical staff have been appointed and staff training, hospital culture and communications have improved.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise hospital which takes account of the need to develop services at the hospital in the context of developing the model of service provision for the entire hospital group.  The draft plan has been submitted to the Department of Health and is being reviewed in detail.  I emphasise again that patient and public requirements are paramount and have underpinned the Department&rsquo;s consideration of the draft plan.<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to services at Portlaoise hospital would have to take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals as well as the need to develop particular services at the hospital in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  As the Deputy is aware, there is increased pressure on the emergency department, patient flows and other services.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House again that once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended that there will be further engagement with all interested parties to ensure the needs of patients, staff and the local and wider community are addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600060#KKK00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1509042000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The problem with the Minister of State's reply is that HSE management has jumped the Minister on this issue.  It met at 2 p.m. yesterday to sign off on the final draft.  The cover letter, of which I have a copy, uses the term \"final draft\" to describe this plan.  The Minister of State read out a response from civil servants and the HSE but I am not interested in it.  The medical staff in the hospital and general practitioners providing a service in County Laois, south County Kildare and County Offaly are the experts on this issue and they have stated this plan will not work.  The Minister must intervene at this point and stop the HSE from proceeding with it.  The plan is the same as the document on the Minister's desk and it must be stopped.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State stated that \"services currently provided that are not sustainable\" will be \"discontinued\".  They cannot be discontinued because there is nowhere to send 40,000 people.  What about the golden hour?  It took me three hours and five minutes to travel from home to Dublin.  Lives will be lost as a result of this plan.<\/p>  <p>  Some years ago, a problem occurred in the maternity unit at Portlaoise hospital.  Staff at the hospital worked with management locally to resolve the problem.  They also networked with the Coombe Hospital and the Portlaoise hospital now provides fantastic maternity services.  Doctors have proposed a plan similar to the process adopted in the case of the maternity unit.  The approach taken some years ago must be replicated for emergency services at the hospital.  This will require staff and resources to be provided.  Once they are provided, the service will improve.  The current service is good but it does not have sufficient capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and HSE will not get away with this plan, not because I say so but because people in the catchment area of Portlaoise hospital will not allow them to do so.  We will not be another Roscommon.  The Minister must take responsibility, shred the plan and work with local management to ensure the hospital has the staff it needs.  The most important issue, however, is to have a plan for Portlaoise hospital because staff, ranging from the people sweeping floors to top managers at the hospital, are crying out for one.

According to census figures and from what I have seen living in and commuting from north Kildare for the past 15 years, the area has the largest percentage of its population commuting to work in Dublin of any area.  Numerous problems have been caused by what I understand to be industrial relations difficulties at Irish Rail and Bus &Eacute;ireann, with the possibility of further difficulties arising in related companies in the transport sector.  Buses have failed to turn up at Kilcock, Clane and Prosperous.  The routes involved are the 115 route, which services Kilcock, Enfield and Mullingar, and the 120 route, which services Clane, Prosperous and Edenderry.  The 126 route to Naas is also starting to be impacted, with people being left at the side of the road unable to get to work.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> We are well aware of six planned service interruptions - six planned strike days - coming up over the next six weeks, many of which are at very critical times.  Not only are these service interruptions becoming the norm, planned improvements that had been long sought and campaigned for and that were finally being arranged, such as the ten-minute DART, which, believe it or not, improves the Kildare timetable, and additional services through the Phoenix Park tunnel into the city centre are being affected.  The Phoenix Park tunnel is a wonderful initiative but its popularity greatly exceeds the supply.  It had been agreed with Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority, NTA, that extra services would be put on that route.  People are struggling to fit into the carriages or to board in the morning.  Extra services, carriages, rolling stock and times were to be added to that route.  All of this is on hold with no end date because of what I understand to be industrial unrest across the unions.  I am not sure if it is official.  It may be in the case of Irish Rail but it may not be so with Dublin Bus, but things like timetable disruptions are not part of any official dispute as far as I am aware, yet management seems unable to roll out these improvements while these issues persist.<\/p> <p> I have been asking this question for some time in the House, including yesterday on the Order of Business, so I wonder whether the Minister has gone out on strike himself in solidarity with the unions because I have not seen him being active about it.  I imagine he will tell me that he is not going to get involved, so maybe that is a gesture of solidarity with the unions.  Maybe the Minister is going on a go-slow himself.  Will he clarify that for us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600060#KKK01200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509042600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>It is astonishing that we again face a national transport strike during the Minister's tenure.  We went through this previously with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Eventually, a settlement was reached.  The very hard-working staff with their five trade unions - Unite, SIPTU, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, and the National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, took a very mature and responsible line at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  They seemed to be inching towards a settlement of around 2.5%, which is a little bit over the general public service rise which has already been agreed.  Suddenly, there was a debacle and it was stopped.  Many people think this was stopped on the Minister's orders because he was not prepared to give the normal pay rise in the public sector to workers in this area.<\/p>  <p>  During the years of the two austerity Governments before this Government, public service obligation, PSO, funding was slashed.  Back in 2007, the company received a PSO of almost &euro;190 million down through 2008 when it received &euro;181 million, 2009 when it received &euro;170 million, 2010 when it received &euro;155 million, 2011 when it received &euro;148 million, 2012 when it received &euro;166 million, 2013 when it received &euro;127 million, 2014 when it received &euro;117 million and 2015 when it received &euro;117 million.  PSO funding has been slashed while at the same time successful rail companies across Europe, like Deutsche Bahn, receive very significant subsidies from their governments that very often are up to two thirds of their turnover.  We need a good public transport system.<\/p>  <p>  One of the worst features of this is that the document that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann apparently presented at the Labour Court set out that four important lines, namely, Limerick to Ballybrophy, Limerick Junction to Waterford, Ennis to Athenry and Gorey to Rosslare, would be closed.  What on earth could be the logic or rationale for this given that we only funded the Ennis to Athenry line in recent times and the Gorey to Rosslare line is vital in the context of Brexit?

I wish to comment on what Deputy Broughan said.  The idea that I somehow intervened in any industrial discussions in any form recently is completely untrue.  I want to put that on the record.  For Deputy Broughan to say that I somehow stopped it, which is what he said, is absolute nonsense.  I had no involvement whatsoever in those talks.  I would like to make that absolutely clear.  When the Deputy says those things, I am sure they are said with good intent and no doubt he has heard them from people who may well have been involved in some way or interested in those talks, but I can tell the Deputy categorically that this was not the case.<\/p>  <p>  I share both Deputies' disappointment that the WRC-led discussions between unions and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann ended without agreement.  I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  I am not, however, involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.  Industrial relations and pay are a matter for the company and its employees, not for me.  Pay disputes must be solved by engagement between an employer and its staff.  The State can assist through the normal industrial relations machinery available in these circumstances, and the Labour Court and WRC are the appropriate fora for these discussions.  That is where a resolution was achieved in the disputes we already witnessed in the past year.  I have made it clear time and again, and I will repeat it to make it absolutely clear, that I will not intervene in areas where it is not appropriate for a Minister to intervene.  I will not dictate to management and unions an agreement that only they can craft because it relates to issues that only they have an insight into.  The WRC and the Labour Court are ready and able to assist both parties in coming to that agreement.  I am disappointed that despite the intensive efforts by the parties facilitated by the WRC and previously the Labour Court, it looks like Irish Rail commuters will face disruption in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding funding of our public transport services, I recognise that subvention levels were reduced during the recession.  Most areas of public expenditure were.  However, the PSO subvention increased last year and again this year and will increase yet further next year.  Over the three years, the PSO subvention will have increased by 35% in total.  In 2018, &euro;285 million of Exchequer, or taxpayer, funds will be allocated to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services throughout the country.  As is normal, the precise allocations to the individual transport companies will be decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and in accordance with the various contract arrangements it has in place with PSO service providers.<\/p>  <p>  I will address the issues raised by Deputy Lawless.  The Deputy is quite right that a number of services were impacted during the early stages of the changes to rosters.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that it is continuing to implement measures to improve service levels further and that recently there have only been a very small number of cancellations.  So far this week, the company has confirmed that there have been no cancellations due to driver unavailability.  Regular updates were issued by the company with regard to delays and cancellations, and additional measures were introduced by the company to regularise operations and minimise impacts.  It is understood that agreement was reached at the WRC on Tuesday last, 24 October 2017, to ensure all aspects of the Labour Court recommendation, including new rosters, will be rolled out by 12 November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600061#LLL00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1509042600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the fact that the Minister cannot or will not get involved is cold comfort to the commuters literally left waiting in the rain at the side of the road.  In respect of the figures the Minister mentioned relating to Bus &Eacute;ireann, I met its chief executive this week and also discussed this with him.  He was available to have the conversation, for which I credit him.  Out of some 300-odd services, only seven were affected.  Unfortunately, those seven services involved the same bus every day for a week, so the people who were trying to get to work at 7 a.m. and who were at the side of the road in Kilcock, Clane or Prosperous had the same experience every day.<\/p><p>In addition to service disruptions, we are effectively going backwards.  The rail network had progressed to an extent where it was becoming competitive and attractive as a mode of transport in terms of price, comfort and convenience.  Improvements such as the Phoenix Park tunnel, which are welcome and needed, are now being hindered by the fact one cannot use the services because the rolling stock is inadequate.  New timetable improvements to introduce off-peak services and additional carriages are being curtailed.  I do not think this is part of the official industrial action.  It is probably a knock-on effect of poor relations in the management structures and the unions.  It is not part of the official action but has been allowed to continue unchecked for several months.  Surely, the Minister could direct on that point alone.  There are issues such as the ten-minute DART and additional Phoenix Park services, which do not fall within the parameters of the current dispute, yet are being hindered for the same reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600061#LLL00400","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509043200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>The Minister has a huge responsibility to the travelling public, the company and workforce to ensure rolling strikes on 1 November, 7 November, 14 November, 23 November and 8 December do not go ahead.

I take his point about the area and its large population of 5,000 people, about the fact that the repairs were stopped up to 2008 and that it is obviously an important road in an area that contains an Irish college, a fire service and schools.  He said that the community has been protesting for the past five years - certainly for a long time.  I am aware that there have been meetings on the matter in recent weeks, which has probably sparked the Deputy's renewed interest in it.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the road in question connects Carraroe to the Connemara islands.  As the Deputy knows, the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from the local authority&rsquo;s own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.  As regards grants provided by my Department, allocations are made at local authority level and the distribution of grants to municipal districts is a matter for each council.  It is also open to each local authority to prioritise the allocation of its own resources to address road issues in particular areas.<\/p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, to which the Deputy referred, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for specific grants for schemes costing less than &euro;5 million and for strategic improvement grants for schemes costing more than &euro;5 million with a view to strengthening, widening or realigning regional and local roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant that these grant schemes had to be curtailed from 2013 because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.<\/p>  <p>  The capital plan for the period 2016 to 2021 provides for the gradual build up in funding for the road network, but it will take many years to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason there continues to be very limited scope for funding projects under the specific grant programme.  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under this grant programme are assessed by my Department on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration given to higher-cost bridge rehabilitation works, significant safety schemes and improvement works that promote employment.<\/p>  <p>  All projects proposed by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the public spending code and the Department&rsquo;s capital appraisal framework.  It is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  It is, therefore, for Galway County Council, as part of its budget and road programme planning process, to assess the condition of the road and what works might be needed taking into account its overall priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600063#NNN00100","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1509043800,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Aire as an &eacute;isteacht chomh c&uacute;ramach sin leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; agam.

As my party's spokesperson on Dublin, I want to focus on some small aspects of the national planning framework, NPF, that affect Dublin.  I will be coming back to my constituency, as we all do, because everybody's constituency in one way or another is a microcosm of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of the NPF is to guide the future development of the country, taking into account particularly the projected population increase and the need for corresponding employment to meet that population increase.<\/p><p>We heard from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI today of the health needs and the infrastructure the State will have to provide in the next few decades to deal with the challenges we face.<\/p> <p> Even though the planning framework does not specifically refer in detail to Dublin, there needs to be a planned future of the city and the city region.  In terms of anybody who has an interest or a stake in the city and an interest in its future, and I am mindful of bodies such as Dublin Chamber tends to get the headlines, but all the other interested bodies and stakeholders would like to see a planned future for the city.  When we consider the challenges facing Dublin, from a Dublin perspective and that of some of the regional capitals, if ever there was an case for the need for a directly elected executive voice to co-ordinate plans for the future of this capital, the national planning framework demonstrates it.  I know the Minister's party was supportive of it but I have heard talk recently of a move to the idea of having a directly elected major for each of the four Dublin local authorities.  I do not have an issue with that as long as there is one overarching voice somewhere who can pull people together to make the strong hard decisions that need to be made and to bring the people of the capital with them.<\/p> <p> IBEC's contribution, which is itself a fine document, to the national planning framework refers to the ranking of Dublin in global terms.  We are the 20th city in global ranking, which is not a bad ranking, but I think we would all agree that it would be our ambition, aim and objective to improve it.  The statistics start to spiral downwards after that.  Dublin has a 43% congestion level and it take 50 minutes longer per day to commute in Dublin than it does in other parts of the country.  According to IBEC, that amounts to 192 hours extra travel time per year, which is eight full days extra travel time in Dublin.  I know that if I do not leave Knocklyon at 7 a.m. to come to the D&aacute;il, there is no point leaving until 9.15 a.m. because it will take 90 minutes some days to travel 11 km to Leinster House.  The national planning framework can announce pious aspirations as to how to deal with these issues in the medium and long term, and hopefully it sets out a vision for the capital, but the problem is that these are real issues facing people now in the city region. <\/p> <p> The M50 is almost at gridlock.  I get a notification to my phone from the Live Drive twitter account, which is an interesting one to follow.  Even if 50% of the tweets are accurate in terms of the impact caused by delays arising from collisions occurring either on the M50 on a daily basis or on roads leading to it, never mind all the other minor collisions that occur throughout the city, it highlights that there is a great deal in which the traffic corps could be engaged.  I noticed in the spending Estimates for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that there is a commitment to provide funding for the demand management measures that are required on the M50.  This includes the digital signage that enables the National Transport Authority, NTA, to control the speeds on the M50 at peak times or during bad weather.  When it appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, Transport Infrastructure Ireland said that such measures could buy it an extra five or six years in terms of the M50's capacity.  This needs to be delivered very quickly.  It must be fast-tracked because there are far too many collisions which are causing incredible delays and tailbacks.  We know that congestion already costs an estimated &euro;350 million annually in Ireland generally and Dublin accounts for a great deal of that amount.  There are no immediate plans to deal with that but small steps could be taken.<\/p> <p> I am speaking as my party's spokesperson on Dublin, but this is not about a Dublin versus rural divide because a prosperous Dublin creates a prosperous country.  I hate to see competition, and I also hate to hear some people who occupy the seats to my left talk about everything stopping at the Red Cow roundabout.  The bulk of my constituency and other Dublin constituencies are beyond the Red Cow roundabout.  It is worth reminding people that the most disadvantaged areas in the country remain in Dublin and, therefore, the challenges in terms of those who are disadvantaged remain in Dublin.<\/p> <p> The Dublin region, which also takes in Wicklow, Kildare, Meath, and Louth, generates half of Ireland's GDP.  I wish to point to one area where a great deal of work needs to be done.  In fairness, the previous Government gave powers to the local authorities to begin the development of tourism in the three regional Dublin county areas and a great deal more work could be done in that regard.  I ask the Minister to challenge his Cabinet colleagues to compare the annual spend on research and development in tourism and the annual spend on research and development in the area of agriculture.  Tourism was probably the most resilient product we had during the crash.  It was at least as resilient as agriculture.  It is not about attacking agriculture but about giving a product that has stood the test of time, and that is like gold to our economy, equal status, or at least the status it deserves.<\/p> <p>  Although Dublin Chamber is not the oracle on all things Dublin, it is a useful guide with respect to the issues that bother employees in the Dublin region because the companies they represent employ close to 300,000 people.  The most immediate problems facing Dubliners, as the Minister will know as he is a Dublin Deputy, are the chronic housing shortage, the high cost of rent,  about which the Minister has heard enough during the past hour and half, and the transport options.  After the housing and rental challenges facing the Government, it will be judged on the solutions it brings forward in short-term initiatives and responses to the transport challenges which involve the chronic and growing gridlock in the city and its surrounding areas. <\/p> <p> Everybody from Dublin Chamber to IBEC has spoken about building upwards in Dublin, and the Minister has also mentioned it.  In criticising him, I have asked where is the queue of developers applying for planning permission.  I believe the Minister and I would share a vision about how we would like to see Dublin built and developed.  The national planning framework offers an opportunity to feed into this in a constructive way.  It cannot be left exclusively to planners.  Dubliners are crying out to be shown a vision of what a high-rise Dublin might look like, whether that might be done through an international architecture competition or otherwise.  Dublin Chamber has broken some ground on this and it has a good video showing what a futuristic Dublin could look like.  Some of it is very attractive, and some of it is very challenging.  It would not necessarily be to my taste.  The Minister will only get Dubliners to buy into the notion of high rise if they see it is accompanied by amenities, appropriate recreational, community and performance spaces and it fits in the context of the city.  I would like to see the planning framework deal with that aspect.<\/p> <p> Regarding transport, all the Deputies who come into this Chamber, particularly from the Leinster counties, will tell the Minister about the growing gridlock.  We need to move quickly to provide large park and ride facilities to facilitate public transport into the city.  We also need to facilitate park and ride facilities that promote the use of public transport.  Before we can promote the use of public transport and deliver on a national planning framewark, the Government will have to invest in public transport in order that people know that if they wish to use that option that it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600063#NNN00800","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509044400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>The previous Deputy said he was speaking as our spokesperson for the Dublin area.  I will be parochial in my comments as well.  I am speaking as a Deputy for Tipperary.  In terms of balanced regional development, the draft document most definitely does not fulfil that title.  The Government gave a commitment that this new national planning framework would not be business as usual and would not repeat past mistakes.  As outlined in the Planning and Development Bill 2016, the following objective will be enshrined in legislation: \"to secure balanced regional development by maximising the potential of the regions...\"<\/p><p>This policy statement and legislation create a clear expectation that a draft plan would deliver on this objective and that it would support the growth of the regions and provide a meaningful counterbalance to the uncontrolled growth of the greater Dublin region.  The population projections provided for in the draft plan are the eastern and midlands assembly area with 2.8 million or 48% of the population; the northern and western assembly area with 1 million or 17% of the population; and the southern assembly area with 2 million or 34% of the population.  These population projections, when analysed further, represent little or no targeted growth in Tipperary&rsquo;s towns, villages and rural areas over the lifetime of the plan.<\/p> <p> If the Government is to deliver meaningful, balanced regional development through socio-economic growth and to support the viability of rural communities, there needs to be a re-examination of population distribution.  This will have serious implications for the future of rural counties.  The estimated potential population growth in Tipperary is 196,000 people in allocated growth figures.  Of those, 60,000 or 16% will be in large towns and the remaining population for small towns, which are defined as below 10,000 people, is 119,000.  Distributed between the nine counties in the southern region, with proportions to be decided by a regional spatial and economic strategy, RSES, it should be 13,222 people each between 2018 and 2040.  That is an average growth in the 22 year period of the plan of 601 people per annum, or 240 houses in our county per annum.<\/p> <p> On the urban structure of the towns, the draft plan has sought to draw a distinction between urban areas above 10,000 people and the remainder of the country.  Rather than go with the CSO designation of a rural town being anything under 1,500 people, the NPF has used a higher figure of 10,000 people.  The only large town in this category in Tipperary is Clonmel.  Other towns such as Thurles, Nenagh, Carrick-on-Suir, Roscrea, Tipperary town, Cashel, and Templemore are effectively defined <\/p> <p> The draft plan does not prioritise the growth and investment needed in infrastructure, such as ports, airports, road and rail infrastructure in the southern region.  The growth and development of strategic infrastructure is critical if balanced regional development is to be achieved over the lifetime of the NPF.  Critical regional infrastructure should be identified for growth and development and included in the national investment plan.  Construction of the M24 linking Limerick, Waterford and Cork is essential.<\/p> <p> On the growth and expansion of Shannon and Waterford airports, Shannon Airport has the potential to build upon well established aviation related activities, while also growing passengers numbers, through utilising existing public capital investment.  The growth and expansion of Foynes, Rosslare and Belview ports will be even more critical once Brexit becomes a reality.  Also vital is the protection and development of intercity rail lines such as the Limerick to Dublin line, Limerick to Waterford and Limerick-Nenagh-Ballybrophy.<\/p> <p> Climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy are key global challenges of our times and effective spatial planning and development should be at the heart of the solution.  I urge the Department to include a stronger national policy response to promote renewable energies and ensure that energy considerations become part of all spatial planning processes.  It is welcome that County Tipperary&rsquo;s leadership has been recognised in the draft NPF.  Tipperary can become a pilot and best practice location for the further development of energy production, the bio-economy, rural development and the creation of jobs in this sector.  Hopefully Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte will play their part and use their extensive infrastructure to ensure that this becomes a reality.<\/p> <p> Our plan must deliver on its core aim of achieving balanced regional development in order to achieve an internationally competitive and sustainable economy and a better quality of life for our citizens.  The draft plan, as published, will not deliver on this central aim, with particular respect to the strategy outlined for growing the regions, the urban structure presented, and the lack of a clear vision and policy framework for towns and villages in rural areas.  If the plan goes ahead as presented in this draft, the rural towns in my constituency, which have been under pressure for long years, will go into even greater decline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600064#OOO00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509045000,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the national planning framework.

I welcome that the national framework may possibly address this, but it is a toothless exercise unless proper capital infrastructure funding is put aside to deliver it.<\/p>  <p>  I slightly regret that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is here.  The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, was here earlier and I would have appreciated it if he had heard my views.  Much of what I have to say has to do with infrastructure regarding roads, rail, greenways and tourism.  They are issues in east Galway.  I live on one side of the Shannon bridge in Portumna.  On the other side are Tipperary and Offaly.  When I cross the Shannon, I enter the \"Ancient East\".  On my side of the bridge is County Galway and there is no development of anything to do with the Shannon there.  That part of the infrastructure and framework is critical for the vision to grow Ireland.  The Wild Atlantic Way and the marketing of Ireland's Ancient East have been so successful and it is very important that we have the same opportunity to develop the branding and marketing of the River Shannon.  Some 23 different county councils feed into the Shannon and that development and framework is very important for us.  It is important to know that funding is there, and we do not look for very much money for marketing.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the rural communities have done much of this work already themselves.  They need funding in respect of the role of Waterways Ireland.  Many of the communities up and down the Shannon depend on Waterways Ireland, which used to be known as Shannon Navigation in the old days.  They depend on it for cleaning the Shannon and for the signage along the river.  Waterways Ireland was one of the subsidiaries that fell under the Good Friday Agreement and, at this time, while the Irish Government pays 80% of the funding towards it, 80% of the employment it creates is in the North.  We have a disparity there which is very evident in places like Killaloe, Portumna or further up towards Shannon Harbour.  I would like to see how that will feed into the national framework document.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to talk about the gridlock we experience in Galway city.  Most of my constituents go into Galway city.  The Minister's colleague, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, spoke very eloquently about the gridlock in Parkmore earlier on.  I have been attending meetings with various business developers from IBEC in Galway and in Westport for two years.<\/p><p>Boston Scientific, Baxter Limited and Medtronic are all experiencing the same problem at Parkmore.  It is the main topic of discussion for them every year when they get together.  To most people, the Parkmore issue is not a difficult one.  It is about putting in place another road to let traffic out.  Unfortunately, addressing the issue fell between stools in the local county councils and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, but progress has made.  It takes the 4,200 people working in this estate up to an hour and a half to get out of it.  Most of these people are from the east, not the west.<\/p> <p> The M17 and M18 were opened a number of weeks ago.  While I welcome and appreciate this progress, regrettably, all the traffic is yet again being fed into Galway city.  While the opening of the M17 and M18 has led to people getting to Galway a lot quicker, the volume of traffic from the M17, M18 and main Dublin-Galway road is causing congestion where our business development is located.  Parkmore happens to be on that side of the city.  The Minister is nodding, which would indicate he has heard what I am saying a hundred times before.  At the last meeting which I attended with IBEC, we were told it would be approximately ten more years before a light rail or outer right ring road is developed.  If that is the case, we are going to lose business in Galway.  While this project is mentioned in the framework, I do not think we can wait ten years for the plans for its development.  I am concerned that if we have to wait that long, business will go elsewhere.  Business needs connectivity.  Businesses need to know that their staff will not have to spend an hour and a half trying to access their place of employment.  They do not want to have to rearrange their shifts and start times to 7.30 a.m. or 8 a.m. to facilitate staff.  It is not only people working in Parkmore that are impacted.  There is a huge volume of people working in our universities and hospitals who have to leave their homes at 5.50 a.m. in the hope that they will make it to work for 8 a.m., which is ridiculous given many of these people live only a half an hour out the road.  I will not labour the point as I think the Minister understands the Galway city transport issue.  A number of Deputies spoke about how wonderful a place Galway is to visit.  Those who want to do so should aim to be there before 3 p.m. on a Friday.  After that time, they will be stuck in traffic for three or four to hours.  This is not what we want.  Galway will be the capital of culture in 2020.  It is important we can get tourists in, around and out of the county in a timely manner.<\/p> <p> I would like to also speak about greenways.  The funding provided in budget 2018 for greenways is very welcome.  Greenways are another form of freight.  They are the freight of people that we can bring into our counties.  In terms of connectivity, the Dublin to Galway greenway is a huge issue at this time.  We need to look at ways to bypass obstacles.  We need to connect with the people in terms of this framework.  Why is it that the only option in terms of getting people from Athlone to Galway is through productive farmland?  This proposal will never merit support.  Anybody in government will find it very hard to sell to a farmer the idea that he or she should allow his or her productive farmland to be divided up.  This is the same farmland that was divided in the context of the development of the Dublin-Galway road.  It is the same farmland that came into focus in relation to the Gort to Tuam bypass.  Farmers are resistant to this and so we need to look at alternative areas where there is lots of Coillte land and Government-owned properties.<\/p> <p> On rural towns, none of the towns in my constituency has a population of more than 10,000.  While my constituency is quite large, not one of the towns in it has a population of 10,000.  Only one of them has a population of 7,500.  It is important when we are looking at balanced regional development that the planning structures to be put in place for rural housing development are also considered.  If we want to have people working in regional hubs, they need to be able to get in and out of them easily.  We must give people the balanced lifestyle that they so choose when they live in the west or anywhere outside of Dublin or the surrounding counties.  We have to give them the opportunity, if they so wish, to build in places such as Woodford or Headford.  People who want to build on the family farm and seek planning permission to do so should not find themselves in an urban fringe or be faced with restrictive planning conditions because it was decided in a county development plan that they cannot build in a particular area.  They might come from that area and have been educated there and are now looking to put their children into schools in that area.  County councils need huge input into this area and that will come through this framework.<\/p> <p> I am disappointed that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has left the House.  In regard to the funding provided for Galway County Council, it is currently two weeks away from a budget and almost broke.  The distribution of equalisation funds needs to be revisited in order that we can keep councils alive and allow them to deliver the planning framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600065#PPP00200","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509045600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I am humbled to have the opportunity to speak to two Ministers.  I hope what I have to say is of some importance.  The national planning framework is welcome.  The last plan put out by the Minister, Deputy Murphy, was Rebuilding Ireland.  It is sad to see the phrase \"Rebuilding Ireland\" being used.  A lot of good work was done in the country over the past 20 years by previous Governments and this should be acknowledged and not overlooked.  This national planning framework is a framework for the next 20 years.  It is hoped it will not be just another aspiration.  The national spatial strategy was launched in 2002, the initiatives and proposals of which were scrapped in 2012 by the previous Government, which is a pity because things might have moved on a bit quicker.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that Dublin is growing rapidly.  It is important it is not allowed to spread beyond the Pale as this would drive a further wedge between Dublin and the rest of the country.  I refer the House to what happened in Britain.  There are many reasons for Brexit.  One of the main reasons for it was the disconnect between people from the city of London and the south-east and people from the rest of Britain.<\/p>  <p>  Investment from the public purse is necessary.  A framework of plans and proposals is no good without investment.  It is important we know what funding will be put in place.  The Government needs to have more foresight.  We need to ensure that when we do invest, we get a return on that investment.  During the crash, other countries under pressure spent additional money on infrastructure because they believed it would generate growth in their economies, and it did.  I know that the American economy is larger than ours.  Former President Obama spent money on the basis that he would get a return from it at the end of day, and he did.  As I said, this plan is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Most of rural Ireland is still dependent on the agricultural industry.  We cannot lose sight of that.  Following on from the reduction in European subsidies, we must ensure a mechanism is put in place to ensure agriculture remains sustainable, not for large commercial farms but for family farms.  Years ago, a farmer could have up to 50 cows on less than 100 acres and have a very attractive income.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Nowadays, a farmer would need to have more than 200 dairy cattle and a couple of hundred acres in order to make a living.  Members do not want such farmers to be put under pressure to borrow more money and thus end up not being the owners of their own operations.  In Denmark, farmers have been burdened with major debts.  We must be careful that such a situation does not occur here.<\/p> <p> In terms of other sectors of agriculture such as tillage, beef or suckling farmers, we do not want to lose the tillage sector.  I emphasise this issue because, in the context of the dismantling of the quota regime for the dairy sector, when the tillage sector was lobbying for its future, former agriculture Ministers told some farming groups they should give up tillage and begin milking cows.  I do not want that to happen.  The tillage sector can play a vital role in rural communities.  Representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine go abroad to promote beverages produced here by distilleries or breweries and make a big issue of that.  The tillage sector needs to be looked after and that must be emphasised in any plans for the future.<\/p> <p> Deputy Rabbitte said the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who has responsibility for infrastructure, was here earlier but he is not here now.  He seems to be very hands-off in his approach to running his Department.  I hope the Taoiseach will come to my area more often to make announcements about infrastructure projects such as the construction of the M20.  Clarification is needed on the status of that motorway, which would connect up the western corridor.  Maps were shown to Members in the House this evening which depict that the west and south west have been neglected in terms of infrastructural upgrades.  Very few major infrastructural projects have been completed in those areas.  The two most recent such projects in my part of County Cork might have been completed by the previous Government but it is lucky that the Government before that took a risk and signed off on them.  Those projects involved the constructions of flyovers at the Wilton roundabout and Bishopstown in Cork city.  We need movement.  I heard earlier that progress is being made on an upgrade to the Dunkettle interchange near the Jack Lynch Tunnel.  Capital projects are needed.  We need to invest and think ahead. Studies have proven that previous capital investments generated economic growth in the surrounding areas.  Ultimately, taxpayers pay for such projects and they will want to know where their money is going and whether they are getting value for money.<\/p> <p> We need further upgrades.  When I first became involved in local government in 1997 I was a member of the South-West Regional Authority.  That was before there was mention of the Celtic tiger.  The priority at the time in terms of a European transport network was from Cork to Rosslare.  It was one of the major network connections required, along with Rosslare to Dublin and Belfast.  That was before there was consideration of motorways from Dublin to Cork, Limerick or Galway.  The European Union considered it more important that we build a European transport network from Cork to Rosslare.  That will be badly needed because if Brexit goes ahead, Rosslare needs to be urgently upgraded as a ferry and cargo port.  The proposed route would connect Rosslare with Belview Port and my own backyard of Cork Harbour.<\/p> <p> The IDA often says at local or regional meetings that big multinationals want to be based in cities or urban areas.  A major employer in Cork asked his employees to choose between working in Fermoy in rural Ireland or in Cork city.  The employees said they would rather the business be based in Cork.  We must ensure that access roads are of a high standard in order that people can drive to work.  The faster a car can move on a road, the less greenhouse gas is generated.  However, electric cars will soon be widespread.  They will become popular when there is no congestion or traffic jams because the last thing one wants if one is driving an electric car is for it to go flat in the middle of a traffic jam.  That is why we must ensure our networks and routes are free flowing.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the M20 and it is important that be put in place.  I hope a guarantee that the M20 will go from Cork to Limerick via Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville can be incorporated in the national planning framework.  I am not being parochial in asking for that because I come from Mitchelstown, which is in the east of the county.  However, I want to ensure that areas such as Mallow are safeguarded.  Road users must also be safeguarded.<\/p> <p> All Members recognise the importance of tourism to the economy.  In fairness to the last Government, it held The Gathering, which was a success, albeit its first in a long time, and it was a great initiative.  However, it will be very hard to sell The Gathering in the future because rural Ireland will be gone.  We must take cognisance of the issues in that regard.  We have a Minister who is trying to kill various aspects of the cultural values of rural Ireland.  I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Ring, is in place in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600066#QQQ00200","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509046200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I will have to ask the Deputy to conclude as he has gone a minute over his time.

Members welcome the opportunity to put in place a national planning framework that will work for all regions and every community in the country from Malin Head to Dunmore East and from south Kerry to north Antrim because there has to be a crossover and we must work closely with the Northern Ireland authorities.  There is a need for balanced development throughout the country.  That is not what is on offer here as the framework is more focused on urban centres than on rural areas.  Many Deputies represent rural constituencies and we have an obligation to ensure that such communities receive a fair and equitable share of any funding that becomes available between now and 2040.  Expenditure on rural Ireland needs to be front-loaded because it cannot wait until 2030 or 2040 for investment.<\/p>  <p>  It is alarming that apart from the first paragraph of the Minister's address on this issue, which referred to realising the potential of our rural regions and areas, there is little reference to doing something tangible for rural areas.  It is mentioned but only as a cosmetic exercise.  The plan does not contain any fresh thinking or new ideas on how to rejuvenate and rebuild rural communities that have been devastated in recent years.<\/p><p>The Minister in his speech correctly stated that the <i>status quo<\/i>cannot hold and further correctly identified that the regions in Europe are being depleted.  That is a fact, but we must do something about it.  We cannot just concentrate on the three regions, the cities and the larger towns.  I come from a county in which the towns are much smaller than those to which Deputy Rabbitte referred.  They are not in the bracket of 1,500 to 10,000.  In outlining his vision for 2040, the Minister must ensure more focus on rural Ireland.  It must be prioritised and we must look in particular at rural planning.  I have been in public life every calendar year since 1979 except for 2015, and to this day, top of my priority list each week here in the national Parliament is planning.  It is a major issue in rural Ireland to have to comply with the national planning guidelines.  I wonder just how many Deputies in government welcomed the decree of the European courts recently in respect of the Flemish case.  There must be a balance between those who are from the area and others.  In my county's development plan, priority is given to those from the area, but now it looks as if all must be treated equally.  If all are to be treated equally, do we put in place regulations that mean no one gets planning and therefore everyone will be treated equally then?  We must find a way to give priority to our own people and those who grew up and lived in the area.  Equally as important are those who had to emigrate because of the economic decline over the years, perhaps going back to the 1940s and 1950s.  There are families coming home now to settle down in rural Ireland.  That is for another day, but we must concentrate on it.  It is becoming increasingly difficult in rural Ireland, so we must ensure we do something about this.  We are trying to use the towns or cities as a magnet to attract people to areas surrounding those towns.  If people want to build in rural Ireland and are prepared to pay for and put in the roads, the new types of septic tanks and the treatment facilities, we should encourage them to do so.  When we look at the plans for a house, we take a very subjective view.  If three planners were put into three different rooms and were all given the same planning application, I am quite sure that each would come out with a different view.<br\/><br\/>I will not spend time on ribbon developments.  I get annoyed when I see that one must build six houses and then leave a gap before building another six.  What about the person who owns the gap, who owns that field?  He or she must forfeit it to the State.  Then it is of no value to him or her whatsoever.  When I first examined the Minister's intentions and direction, I was concerned about the definition of &quot;rural&quot;.  The word is defined as a small number of regions outside Dublin.  We must have balanced rural development, but my fear is that it does not appear that this will happen.  We cannot make the mistake made in the UK in the 1960s and ban one-off housing in rural settlements.  We need to be careful where we are heading.  It is no use stating that we cannot continue with the <i>status quo<\/i>.  We say we cannot hold to the <i>status quo<\/i>, yet we proceed down the same track of more of the same.  The real decisions must be made, and these decisions concern the way in which we develop our rural areas.  Our local authorities must have a major input into this, as must our communities, and there must be greater and greater consultation.<br\/><br\/>When I think of rural development, I think in particular of the airports in rural Ireland that were provided at a time when not much funding was available.  I think of Donegal Airport in west Donegal, one of the top ten most attractive airports in the world into which to land, with two regular flights to Donegal.  Donegal Airport cannot and will not survive if the Government decides to change in any way the public service obligations.  I think this will happen in the case of Kerry Airport as well, but we will look at that very closely.  These airports are important and they will become more important because of the oil exploration happening in the north west of the country.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the smart growth fund provided for in the framework to support strategic growth in renewables in underutilised parts of towns.  This must also help growth in rural areas.  I am pleased that connectivity is very much part of the plan.  Connectivity must connect internationally and nationally.  When I think of most rural and remote areas, if broadband is rolled out, as is the plan, although I think it is being pushed back, it should get into every town and village in this country.  We are told that, as a result of this plan, there will be 600,000 extra jobs based on the knowledge economy.  They do not all have to be in the cities or larger towns.  They can find their way out to the most rural towns.  This will help to improve the opportunities to have global companies in the regions.  We have many of these in the country.  I think of those in Donegal, specifically Randox in my own town of Dungloe.<br\/><br\/>All of us could do with more time but mine is limited.  We should concentrate on a necklace of marinas around the country.  It would attract so many who are interested in leisure tourism.  It could start in Donegal and find its way down through the west and right around the coast.  This would attract jobs to the most rural and peripheral parts of the country where there is no other source of job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600067#RRR00500","speaker":"1289","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509046800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State wish to respond briefly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600068#SSS00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1509046800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I might as well take a stab at it.  I thank all the Members of the House for their valuable, insightful contributions to the discussion.  As many of them have acknowledged, this is one of the most important issues that this Chamber will consider.  We will set down the vision, the ambition and the implementation plan as to how we see our country growing over the course of the next 20 years.  I refer to this as the business case for investment in this country over the next 20 to 25 years, which is important.  Deputy Gallagher is right to say it affects every Department and every agency.  That is why the working group working on this has from the start, certainly from early 2017, brought together all Departments and all agencies and even beyond to ensure we get everyone's view and buy-in to this.  This is important from the point of view of implementation.<\/p>  <p>  While the plan is lovely, has great ideas and aspiration and is visionary, many Deputies asked whether it will happen.  We have seen plans in the past that have not happened.  This time we are trying to get the commitment from everyone to buy in to this.  That is why there has been so much stakeholder consultation, a lot of discussion around the country and a kind of travelling roadshow.  Even around the table, all the key decision-makers are there because we need them to buy in to this.  That is exactly why we are having this debate tonight and why the committee has taken on the role of compiling everyone's issues around this.  We have sought to bring together both Houses of the Oireachtas to feed into the document because it is so important that we get this right and we want to follow through on it. <\/p>  <p>  Deputies questioned earlier whether the Government would follow through on this plan.  I ask them to look at the plans we have brought forward over recent years that we did follow through on, for example, the Action Plan for Jobs, including the regional action plans which are making a difference and driving jobs out into the regions.  Some 70% of the jobs created last year were in the regions.  The Action Plan for Jobs doubled its target.  This is way ahead of expectation.  While we accept the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is not enough to fix the problem, it is tracking its plan and is doing exactly what it set out to do.  We do stick to our plans.  The national planning framework, Ireland 2040, will stretch across many Governments.  God knows who will be in them.  We hope they will stick to this strategy and to the plan.  It is for the benefit of our country that we get by, invest properly in key areas, achieve that regional balance and protect rural Ireland, saving it in some places and restoring it in others.  We must drive that forward while building up our cities for the engine to be able to serve those rural areas too.  It is key that we get that right.<\/p>  <p>  The decisions we take now as to how our cities need to grow and how we revitalise our rural areas, protect our heritage and environment and provide a sustainable society and legacy for our children all have at their core the objective of improving our quality of life and preparing us for a better and different future.<\/p><p> Listening to the many impassioned contributions from Members, understandably promoting their own areas, it strikes me that if we built a framework solely on the basis of everyone's local ambitions, we would fool ourselves again into planning for wholly unrealistic growth prospects.  While Deputies all commented on the national position, they also referred their own areas and what they wanted in terms of housing, development and so on.  That is not really what we are trying to achieve here.  Our country learned a very expensive, &euro;64 billion lesson from an economic crash that was fuelled by what happened in the areas of banking and property speculation and that led to a lost decade.  We must continue to learn from that and ensure that we make proper plans into the future.  If we added together the ambitions expressed for all the cities, all the towns, all the villages and all the rural areas during this debate, we would be talking about a country with 10 million people or more.  The plan in this document foresees a population of 8 million across the entire island, including the North.  This is simply not credible, nor a basis for prudent investment.  We would be fooling ourselves again.  It is important that we focus our submissions on the national picture and that people take time in the weeks ahead to get involved during the consultation period.  We need to realise that not every town or village can take more.  There is a balance to be struck in terms of sustainable development, with some towns and villages needing more to make them sustainable.  We are trying to concentrate on key areas where we can provide services.<\/p> <p> Many speakers referred to issues such as light rail systems in cities like Galway and Cork.  While these are achievable, there has to be a critical mass of people to use them.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  We have to make sure we give people the option to live in rural Ireland, and that is in this plan.  Some people have concerns and we are trying to address those.  I represent a rural area and an urban area - and I live in a rural area - so I understand the concerns.  That is not what this plan is about; it is about recognising that if our cities are going to compete on an international footing, if Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford are going to make an impact in the world and win investment and job creation, they have to be at a certain level and they have to have a critical mass.  With that comes proper additional services like public transport.  We know that if we want to service Galway properly, the city would need to spend up to &euro;900 million on infrastructure within the city to provide for transport.  That is not going to happen unless there is condensed development, using every bit of space in a clever and wise way.  That is for people who want to live in cities, and there are still plenty of people who want to live in rural areas and smaller villages.<\/p> <p> The national planning framework is very strategic and it does not and should not get into every little detail.  The national has called it right in settling what are often competing and at times conflicting aims between our regions, cities and wider rural areas.  Some Deputies stated that we need to address the balance of development between east and west in favour of regional cities, towns and rural areas.  Others remarked that people living in Dublin may continue to do so and that we cannot limit that or stop that, which is right.  That is not what we are trying to do.  We do not live in a command economy.  This is not a location where we can order people to move.  People make choices to live, work and invest on the basis of many influences, including choices made regionally and locally about where to focus, where to prioritise and what sort of places we want now and in the years ahead.  It is about giving people the choice, the option.  Many of those we represent do not have that choice and have ended up living with their families an hour an a half or two hours away from their job, which is not what we want.  We want to ensure that if people want to live in a rural area, they can do that in a sustainable way.  If they want to live in a city, we want to ensure that city will grow in a sustainable way and have the services they need to live in that city.<\/p> <p> The national planning framework is not about parish-pump politics or a one-for-everybody-in-the-audience approach.  Our citizens expect that their politicians will take the long-term view and make the right decisions in their overall strategic interests.  This is our collective responsibility, as national politicians, not only the Government but elected members across the system.  I am glad so many Deputies spoke in this debate, in particular those from Fianna F&aacute;il who were lined up today to speak, one after the other, which is great to see.  This is meant to be a full parliamentary document, not just a Government document.  We are glad to have the involvement of others.<\/p> <p> We must take the lead, show the way and set a clear but straightforward policy context for the supporting State structures at central, regional and local levels in order to make the national planning framework happen through consistent regional spatial and economic plans, as well as development plans at local and community level.  A key part of this will be the regional plans that will be brought forward in 2018.  It is key that everyone has an influence on them before the roll-out in 2019 of the local development plans.<\/p> <p> There were some erroneous suggestions made in respect of the national planning framework leading to a capping city or town and village development - for example, in my own county.  This is simply not the case and it is mischievous to suggest it.  Some Deputies from the same county have a conflict of views on this matter.  It is not about limiting the ambitions of any one county, city or town.  Some of the targets set under the national planning framework for regional cities are hugely ambitious.  If we take Limerick, for example, its growth rate has been effectively flat for the past 30 years and Government wants it to grow by 50% in the next 30.  In my view, that is an ambitious target but I hope it can be achieved.  If it is, Limerick will be in a position to go beyond that.  This is not to cap or to limit but to guesstimate where this could go, and to put the plans, infrastructure and investment in place to make it happen.<\/p> <p> The Government also wants rural villages and smaller towns to thrive.  Everything in the national planning framework supports that, from commitments on rural broadband to transport connectivity, smart growth initiatives to turn around dereliction, and so on.  That is what we can achieve.  It was asked whether we will facilitate people to build at the edge of villages and towns.  We can do that in a proper, co-ordinated way where there are services and use the brownfield sites.  However, there are many small towns and villages where people choose not to live because a site would cost too much.  We had plans in the past where the idea was good but we did not back it up with proper land management strategies, and those sites ended up costing a fortune.  Why would one give up on a free site to go and pay &euro;100,000 for a site somewhere else?  We are going to have an impact.  The State will be involved in real land management issues, which is something we have to consider funding.  In this document, we raised the question of whether we are willing to go there.  I think we should and I think most would agree with that.<\/p> <p> Many Deputies said they would like to see more detail in the national planning framework.  They must realise that this is a framework and that it needs follow-through at regional and local levels.  We cannot have all the detail here today because that would defeat the purpose and the document would probably end up at 1,000 pages, which is not what we want.  It is not that we are against writing 1,000 pages but it would not achieve the end result and we would be accused of making it too top-down in nature.  We want people to buy into this at a local and regional level, as well as at national level.<\/p> <p> From my perspective, there is actually a lot in the draft framework document but, behind all the detail and analysis, there are probably four key principles.  One is better strategic planning for our cities, including Dublin, as our capital and key international driver, so we continue to make that impact and win investment.  That investment wants to come in to key areas where talent is located.  Naturally, there can be follow-on investment from that in all the other cities.  The second principle is growing Ireland&rsquo;s four other cities significantly.  Investing means investing in our regions.  We represent different counties and know it is about having the talent and access to people.  That is why Galway has done so well in the area of medtech because it has become that hot spot for that sector.  Regions can bring certain skill sets to this that we can drive forward.  The third point is addressing connectivity to and opportunities within Ireland&rsquo;s regions and rural areas.  This is key.  If rural Ireland is to survive, we have to connect it, a point many Deputies have raised.  We have to do this in a sustainable way while making sure the connections are there so businesses can thrive and people can open a business or rural enterprise and make it sustainable, and continue to grow their area.  The fourth is securing more compact forms of development to reduce sprawl and to provide more choice.  If someone is from a rural area, they do not want the town to grow out to them.  They want to have the choice to live in a rural area and they want the town to grow up in a compact way, not to be getting closer every day.  If we manage this right, we can achieve both as best as we possibly can.<\/p> <p> We know the statistics.  We have to cater for an extra 1 million people in the years ahead.  If we plan this right, that should bring with it an extra 600,000 jobs and 500,000 houses.  Now is the time to think about it and to plan ahead for ten to 20 years' time.  I am glad Members were interested in contributing to this debate.  I want to reflect on the contributions, particularly from Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies, who have stressed the need for more consultation time.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has announced that an extra week will be allowed.  We had planned to close the consultation process on 3 November next but there will be an extra week to give people more time to buy into this and to get involved in the conversation.  I had a bit of a row with Deputy Kelleher because we have had this open for discussion since last February through different channels.  It is only when we get to the draft document that people want to get involved and to focus in.  There is now the extra week.  November is going to be a busy month.  I ask Deputies to take time to get involved because this relates to everyone's future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600068#SSS00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1509047400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.30 p.m until 2 p.m on Tuesday, 7 November 2017.<\/p>"}]
