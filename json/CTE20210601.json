It is a good time to take stock of the position in this regard.  I welcome Mr. Brennan and Ms Bristow.  They have done a great deal of work on the online sale and supply of pets and where matters could be improved.<\/p> <p>  The Dogs Trust's previous research found that 68% of the members of the public questioned were unable to spot an illegal advertisement.  Of the 62 advertisements on one online platform, only one was in compliance on a particular day.  It appears that welfare groups, organisations like the Dogs Trust and volunteers are doing the work the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should be doing, which is making sure that existing regulations are enforced.  When I raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, he confirmed that not a single infringement case had been taken in respect of any online sale advertisements.  That is despite five sample cases, ready for prosecution, were sent to him last December.  The advice that comes from the Department is for consumers to do their own due diligence.  If online platforms do not have access to the information to verify details, then what hope have members of the public?<\/p> <p>  I will ask the witnesses about the online verifiability and traceability of dogs in particular.  In their opinion, is it possible to have a single national dog breeding establishment database detailing the number of breeding bitches and the location of establishments involved?  When I looked for this information from various local authorities, it was patchy.  In some cases, I had to request it.  In others, it was publicly available.  The Department published its information but it does not have a live database so one cannot keep track of who is on it and who is not.  Can we have something similar to the register for gas fitters whereby it would be possible to go online to verify who the dog breeder is and the level at which he or she is breeding animals?<\/p> <p>  What is the witnesses' views on microchipping?  There are currently four databases in Ireland.  Is it possible to have some sort of system where information from the four databases is, again, in a single location, so online platforms can not only verify that this is the microchip of a dog but also the type of dog, its age and status?  Those are my first two questions.  Is this stuff possible and are there examples we can learn from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#A00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee for having us here today and I thank the Senator for her questions.  To answer them very directly, yes, this technology is possible.  It is available and is used by the Government in other ways, for example, in the context of car registration.  To verify a car, its source and what exactly it is, all one has to do is type the registration number.  Plenty of stakeholders are able to access a database to verify whether details put up on an online platform are true.  The online platforms are also able to do the verification up front, which is what we would want.<\/p> <p>  I will say at the outset that the legislation the Department brought out last year is actually very good.  It was very well thought out.  If it is enforced and underpinned by traceability, we will be in a very good position.  We are not often in a position to do something that will be game-changing for consumers, criminality and animal welfare.  That is why we are today, to ask the committee to empower and fund the Department to put in a verification and traceability system.  These systems already exist in other parts of the Government.  This is not brand-new technology and it is very doable.  It is not acceptable to rely on public or private selling platforms to do all the work.  The reality is that enforcement has to come from the powers that actually put out the legislation.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question very directly, it is absolutely possible to have a single database of breeders and verification of microchipping.  We are very lucky in Ireland that we only have four microchipping databases.  The UK has a multitude of databases, which makes it much more difficult.  All we need to have is a piece of plug-in technology to verify if a microchip is real and whether the details match those of the dog that has been put online for sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Becky Bristow"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I will quickly add to what Ms Bristow said.  On the Senator's point about registrations that are currently live, local authorities look after the dog breeding establishment, DBE, register.  The situation is disparate and uneven when looking for the register.  The introduction of these rules for the online sale, supply and advertising of pets means there is now a seller-supplier list, which the Department has set up.  If more than six pets are sold in a calendar year, the seller must register.  To its credit, that has been quite successful.  Approximately 500 people are registered on the latest list.  What we getting at with traceability is joining those dots together, basically.  These are two different lists, notwithstanding, say, a charity.  If it is possible to both verify the microchip number and, as is in the rules, also put down the DBE or seller licence number and verify it against the lists out there in the ether within different Departments, that would go a huge way towards traceability and all the other benefits it would unlock that we can discuss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I will ask one supplementary question on that.

My daughter and various family members are animal lovers and have dogs, etc., but I have just one issue.  In the last 12 months, I have been obliged to walk a lot because of my health condition.  I average probably six to eight miles per day.  I am not sure if it is appropriate to raise it here but I have one simple question.  How one can control littering by dogs?  In the significant walks that I do, it is absolutely disgusting.  I have seen my grandchildren walk into poos.  I know that 90% of dog owners are responsible, but there should be some way of highlighting the 10% who disrespect our footpaths.  This morning I walked six or seven miles around Dublin.  I was appalled by the amount of dog excrement on the streets.  I live in Schull, a beautiful place in west Cork.  As I said, 90% of people who have dogs are very honourable.  They look after their dogs and make sure that if they litter, the excrement is picked up.  However, on the 10%, it galls my heart to see a three-year-old toddler walking into this stuff and trying to clean their shoes.  It is only a small issue, but it is something that should be highlighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#B00200","speaker":"1691"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

It is about responsible dog ownership.  The Senator may have seen local authorities around the country running much stronger campaigns about picking up after dogs.  Dogs Trust has had a &ldquo;scoop the poop&rdquo; campaign this week about that.  However, there has to be an imposition of fines to make any difference.  A very forward-thinking local authority in Leitrim is currently running a test run of genetically testing the litter in order to trace back to the dog and, therefore, dog owner who left it behind.  Of course, the dog cannot pick it up.  There are possibilities in the future.  We have local authorities in Ireland which are being imaginative and innovative in finding ways to do this.  However, at the present time, it is about trying to get people to be more responsible.  It is about the public education campaigns on how it is not only disgusting, but it is a very serious hygiene issue for people and for children.  We have all heard the ad campaigns about people who are blind or who are in wheelchairs.  Can one imagine how disgusting that must be for them?  They do not have the possibility to avoid it.  We are heavily involved in campaigning on responsible dog ownership.  However, there are other possibilities ahead.  They would tie into insuring and fining, and making sure that dogs are microchipped.  We could, at the point of microchipping, have a DNA sample to make the dog traceable in future.  There are options to consider to join up all of this, so that Ireland becomes a dog-friendly place, and so that this does not cause difficulties for the humans in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Becky Bristow"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bristow and I call Senator Boyhan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#B00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  First, I want to welcome Ms Bristow and Mr. Brennan.  I thank them and acknowledge the enormous work they do in Dogs Trust.  It is an impressive charity.  I know a certain amount about it because I know people who are involved in it.  More than 1,000 dogs were rehomed in 2020.  That is a phenomenal success story in itself.  The two areas on which I want to concentrate today are about the funding of Dogs Trust and on the mechanism for funding.  I know it gets many voluntary contributions, but does it get State funding or funding from the local authorities?  The reason I ask is that I carried out a survey of all 31 local authorities about two years ago.  It first identified what money they had received from the Department.  It tried to identify where the allocation was.  What was very clear was that many authorities had not passed on money they had ringfenced for animal welfare.  That raised a number of concerns.  We had serious issues in regard to animals in a number of counties, which were documented in the local and provincial press.  Again, some local authorities were not proactive.  Other authorities are exceptionally proactive.  I would like to hear about the funding mechanism and how it secures funding.  I am sure it never has enough.  The witnesses might talk to us about that and about their relationship with the 31 local authorities.  I do not expect them to take me through all 31 local authorities but, generally, the relationships Dogs Trust has with designated people involved in animal welfare, dogs and related issues.  That is important because I detect inconsistent and patchy commitments in different local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Where does Dogs Trust get its funding?  What percentage of its funding comes from voluntary sources as opposed to State, agency or Department funding?  Could the witnesses address those two issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#B00600","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  Dogs Trust is a little unusual in that all its funding comes from public donations.  We do not apply for Government funding for animal welfare work at this point in time.  We have a relationship with all local authorities, because we take dogs directly from local authority pounds.  The relationships vary.  On the whole, they are positive.  It comes down to resources in local authorities, where they are applying those resources and what their priority is at this point in time in relation to dogs or dog welfare.  There can be tension between dealing with strays and issues in the community with dogs, versus dogs they have in their care, what they need to do with them, and being proactive to prevent the problems in the future.  I am not sure if this answers the Senator's question.<\/p> <p>  On the funding side we are a little unusual.  Virtually every other dog rescue and animal welfare place probably accesses considerable State funding, but I do not know of any that are fully State funded.

It does good work but maybe it is happy enough.  I would like to have an understanding, because we hear of animal welfare groups which are challenged, which say that they have to shut down, and which are under-resourced.   I am thrilled to see that Dogs Trust can manage.  It says something about the Irish people that they are committed to support animal welfare.  I think this is brilliant.

I thank Senator Boylan for making sure this issue was raised in the committee.  Sometimes time is very limited and we all have our own priorities.  As a farmer, this issue would probably not have been top of my priority list so I compliment Senator Boylan for making sure it was raised here today.<\/p> <p>  Earlier in the year, I raised in the Seanad the issue of sheep worrying.  When I researched it, I was dumbfounded to find that the last report on the implementation of the Control of Dogs Act stated that while there are an estimated 800,000 dogs in the country, only 217,000 of them are chipped.  This is unbelievable.  That is the thrust of my questions.  In any walk of life and in any instance, it is very easy to police the compliant.  How do we overcome non-compliance?  Reading the briefing note, I was confused by the jumping from Department to Department.  They say that too many cooks spoil the broth.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is responsible for the Control of Dogs Act in conjunction with local authorities, but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is responsible for the micro-chipping of dogs.  It is frustrating for me to even get my head around the briefing note going from one Department to the other.  What would be the ideal solution?  How can we bring this under one umbrella?  Would that improve things?  <\/p> <p>  When I spoke about sheep worrying, what seemed to come to the fore was an ignorance, for want of a better word, on the part of even responsible pet owners about how their dog would perform off the leash.  It was a case of \"my dog is a pure pet\".  They did not realise what their timid, tame and loveable dog might do once it met up with another dog once it was off the leash and took on a pack mentality.  Somebody suggested to me that when a person went to license his or her dog, there should be a simple theory test along the lines of the driver theory test.  It would be a tick-box exercise that would highlight the responsibilities of responsible, dedicated and, for want of a better word, good owners so that a person would have to take something similar to the driver theory test to get a licence.  If nothing else, it would highlight the responsibilities owners are taking on as registered pet owners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#C00300","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will let Mr. Brennan take the question on the two Departments dealing with this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Becky Bristow"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>That is a problem we came across a number of times.  As regards the Senator's question as to whether there could be an umbrella group, the different pieces of legislation are working in their own way.  If we were to strengthen or modernise the DB licence list so that each local authority digitises and updates the list and ensures it is updated on a regular basis and contains sound information, in a similar way, if we make it accessible for the seller and supplier list, which has now been live for a year and a half, we would then empower the person looking to buy a dog online to do his or her own research.  Once a consumer knows the micro chip is verified and has a dog breeder, DB, licence number or potentially a seller or supplier number, he or she can easily access where they are on the list and where the dog is coming from.  If it is DB licensed, the consumer will have the information that should be available on local authority websites.  Instead of what I can imagine might be a convoluted process of bringing the list together, which would be great, the tools are in place and it seems there is a modernisation of these lists so that gives a consumer power and he or she knows where he or she is getting the dog from and that the micro chip has been verified.  The second part of that goes back to the idea that where someone is selling online, and it is in the rules that a person needs to list a legitimate micro chip number, that person must verify that before it goes live.  The person must put in the details, get a one-time code and put that code in.  The code is verified against the person's PetNet and only then can the advertisement go live.  That mechanism can verify that the dog is correct and unlock a significant amount of information that is legitimate and verifiable that the consumer can use to make his or her decision.

On cash sales, the big-picture thinking going on in the UK on these matters is quite interesting.  Discussions are under way there regarding the possibility of banning cash sales of pets.  I am not sure if people would be clear as to why this is such an issue.  The cold hard reality is that once cash is involved, criminality is allowed for.  This results in a lack of revenue for the Government and allows poor welfare to be hidden.  That is our concern.<\/p> <p>  How would one go about banning it?  It is quite an interesting question.  If one made a lot of noise about banning cash sales of pets, members of the public might start to ask themselves why they are being asked for cash, so quite the same level of enforcement as is needed for other legislation might not be required.  Even just talking about it enough and getting people to stop and think about why legislation and a ban on cash sales is being considered might cause them to ask why that is the case.  Then, when they come to pay for a pet, they may say that they do not wish to pay cash.  We all know that people sometimes choose to pay cash for various reasons but in this space, people accept it so readily that they do not realise what is wrong with it.  As to how such legislation would be brought in, I have to respectfully say that is not my area of expertise but I believe the mere fact of bringing in such legislation and talking about it would make an enormous difference.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question about the rate at which dogs were being destroyed.  It is really about where they are being destroyed.  Fifteen years ago, 26,000 dogs were put to sleep in local authority pounds in one year.  In 2019, fewer than 400 were.  That is a massive sea change for which we are deeply grateful.  A lot of work went into that in terms of what happens to the dogs.  They get rehomed and there is also more neutering going on so there are fewer accidental litters.  However, Dogs Trust research has uncovered that part of the problem has moved to private vets.  People are acquiring dogs from low-welfare breeders.  These puppies are not socialised and have health issues and, unfortunately, are having to be put to sleep by vets at quite a young age because of behaviour and difficult veterinary issues.  That is a problem. <\/p> <p>  Although I will own up and say that I do not have specific research on this, we also question what happens to some dogs.  We have 90 licensed dog breeding establishments in this country, some of which have 100, 200 or 300 breeding females.  What happens to them when they are finished?  We do not know.  The issue has, therefore, improved as it pertains to the local authorities.  They have really got on board with the improvements that can be made.  We feel that the problem has moved elsewhere and that it is still a problem that needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about dangerous breeds.  Dogs Trust is very clear in saying that it is about the deed not the breed.  I would say that it may be a matter of a dangerous owner rather than one of a dangerous dog.  We are not in favour of the restricted breeds list.  We feel that one of the things it does is suggest to people that a German shepherd is a problem while a Labrador is not.  It is about how owners socialise dogs as puppies, how they treat them, how they interact with the dogs and how they teach people to interact with them.  It is about learning about dogs' behaviour and knowing the warning signs so that bites do not happen.  A very big part of what we do in Dogs Trust is educating children and adults about dog behaviour.  I strongly believe it is not appropriate to categorise particular dog breeds as dangerous.  It is very much a question of the individual dog and the circumstances in which it has been bred and trained.  Sadly, it is often being badly treated that leads to those behaviours.  I will hand over to Mr. Brennan because the Deputy had some questions about the single Department and the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Becky Bristow"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Before Ms Bristow hands over to Mr. Brennan - and I will let him in in a minute - I will just go back over some of the questions Deputy Paul Donnelly asked to get a bit more clarity, if I may.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#D00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Becky Bristow"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On the rehoming of dogs, is Dogs Trust directly involved?

I thank the Chair for those questions.  We are heavily involved in rehoming.  We have been rehoming an average of 2,000 dogs a year from Ireland via Dogs Trust for the last decade.  In the last year, we rehomed 1,200 in Ireland.  Prior to the pandemic, we did have to rehome some via our rehoming centres in the UK.  We are not the only charity to do so.  It is better to have them travel a little distance and be rehomed than to have them face the alternative.<\/p> <p>  What could we do with more resources?  The reality is that any more resources should be used to tackle things upstream.  Rather than getting to the point at which dogs are surrendered and end up in pounds for rehoming, I would encourage the provision of more resources to tackle matters upstream, including low-welfare breeding and the lack of traceability.  These are the dogs that end up needing rehoming.  I encourage the provision of resources to deal with these matters.  I hope that answers the Chair's question on rehoming.<\/p> <p>  In the figure of 90 dog breeding establishments, DBEs, I quoted, I excluded greyhound breeders.

We encourage more joined-up thinking, crucially around something like the dog breeding establishment, DBE, licence register as it relates to say, the online advertising of dogs.  There is a connection there; it is in the rules that if a person has a DBE licence he or she must list it but more joined-up thinking is needed about how compliance is really strengthened because at the moment, I do not know if it is lack of education but there is a severe lack of compliance.

When I went looking on some of the platforms, I saw one particular seller had &euro;60,000 worth of dogs for sale in one week alone.  That gives an idea of the scale we are talking about and the revenue potentially lost there as well.  Mr. Brennan has probably addressed some of that but does that traceability help with the Revenue keeping track of this?  Of course, we all want people to go for rescue dogs.  However, if a person chooses to buy a particular breed of dog from a supplier, what sort of consumer protections are in place if there are no companion animals to find, because they are in this no man's land?<\/p> <p>  I also want our guests' opinions on something else.  Senator Paul Daly was talking about sheep-worrying and so on.  One of the Bills I have been working on with the DSPCA relates to linking the microchip to the licence system as a proof of ownership.  In the current situation, a person can get a dog licence within a matter of hours online and there is a space for a microchip number but he or she is not obliged to fill it in.  Does the trust agree it would be helpful to have that joined-up approach?  That way we are not denying the local authority the revenue from the licence fee but we are bringing that joined-up approach to it, whereby the microchip and the licence are the proof of ownership.  Those are the two points I wanted to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#E00600","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>We would absolutely support linking the microchip to the licensing.  Anything that joins up the traceability and the ownership can only be a good thing.  I will give the committee a sense of the size of the market, and this is only a vague estimate.  Last year, 125,000 dogs were microchipped in Ireland, and at an average price of &euro;1,500 that is &euro;187 million.  That is &euro;187 million, primarily in cash transactions, which is not traceable.  This is a big deal.  This is an industry.  It is not about someone's friend's dog having the occasional accidental litter.  From a consumer protection perspective, a person has no idea who he or she is getting this dog from.  If there are any issues with it, be those health issues or that it is not the dog people thought it was - we have numerous cases where it is a different type of breed, older, very sick dogs - a person may be going back to a phone number that may no longer be connected.  Therefore the issue of traceability and consumer protection is huge.<\/p> <p>  The same is true for the lost revenue angle, in the form of lost VAT, income tax and corporation tax.  Obviously, we are here to say that for us it comes back to dog welfare but all of this interconnects.  When people can hide behind all this lack of traceability and verification, they can breed dogs in utterly deplorable conditions.  We got 37 dogs in recently from a puppy farm, which was an illegal one, and we had to get a counsellor in because the staff were so traumatised by what they saw of these breeding females.  We accept breeding is a necessity but it must be done in good welfare conditions, which is completely possible.  It is possible to make a profit from it given the price of dogs these days.  Obviously we say: \"Adopt, don't shop\" but we completely understand people may want a particular breed or a puppy but at the moment there is no way for the public to know where they are getting the dog from.  There is no way for them to do the right thing when they want to do the right thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Becky Bristow"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I will return to the point Deputy Paul Donnelly was raising.  It is my experience on this committee that when we deal with any issue that crosses multiple Departments, problems and complications arise, which simply would not happen if there was a very clear demarcation of responsibility.  We are dealing with a scenario where obviously the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a very clear role and the Department of Rural and Community Development seems to have a less clear role and then the role of local authorities is mixed so it is almost as if there are three Departments involved.  I note from some media reports that the staff of the dog control unit in the Department of Rural and Community Development have raised concerns about where they are.  What does Ms Bristow consider to be the best way to approach this issue holistically with respect to what type of structure should be in place?  My view is that local authorities have a very important role to play.  They are the bodies that are on the ground with staff on a county-by-county basis so should there be a role for them at State-wide level and how should it operate if we were starting with a blank sheet?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I understand Dogs Trust Ireland is a charity and there are a number of different charities, which I am sure all have their own distinctions in terms of policy priorities and so on.  Again, it has been my experience that when a public service, which is essentially what we are talking about here, is outsourced, even to charities, problems arise, errors can happen or gaps will emerge.  Is there a way whereby all the charity organisations and other stakeholders can work together such that the work of ensuring dogs, the public and everybody else are kept safe and that these things are happening in a transparent and clear manner, is guided at departmental level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#E00800","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Even if we just started with the verification of microchips, that would be a big step forward.  Where the Department of Rural and Community Development comes in is in having that one list of licensed DBEs.  That would be its key input.  A critical issue for both Departments is to also request a tax registration number for the DBE licence, for getting on to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's list.

Some 52,000 people signed a petition asking for this legislation to be enforced.  The public want it to happen and we can help support charities in educating the wider public about what responsible dog ownership is and how to acquire a dog responsibly.  Verifying the online sale information is the critical action that is needed right now and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has to take responsibility for that.  There is literally no other way.  For a year, all the various stakeholders have been talking about this, pointing out different issues, and saying it should come under another Department or the different platforms.

The one single factor in both of those cases is irresponsible ownership and possibly the lack of ownership.  Operators are buying and selling in the black economy and animals have become valueless, particularly in the equine industry where horses are stamped out of the food chain and the taxpayer is responsible for the disposal of the carcass.  An equine animal that ends up in the knackery has lost its value to the food chain. According to our figures, the cost is almost &euro;2,000 per animal.  On top of that, these horses must go to the knackery.  That costs another &euro;800.  Therefore, every equine animal that is stamped out of the food chain costs the taxpayer almost &euro;3,000.  The Irish taxpayer was never alerted to any of this nonsense in respect of the equine industry.<\/p> <p>  In the canine industry, with the online passport, we will be able to regulate the breeders.  We are tackling the black economy in the industry through the stipulation that no animal can move from one ownership on the online passport to another, without that owner having a registered premises.  It cannot be transferred on the system.  The domestic units that are breeding puppies are contributing hugely to the animal welfare issues in the canine industry.  With the online system, we are proposing that every owner has a canine premises.  Moreover, in respect of both the canine and equine industries, a yearly census is to be carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That is the policing tool for both industries.  Every movement of a horse or a dog will be traceable.  There will be traceability of where the animal is coming from and where it is going, more importantly.  With an online passport, the animal cannot leave the owner's premises to go to an unregistered premises.<\/p> <p>  With the online system, in the case that animals that are found dead, whether they are canine or equine, it does not matter when they are found.  If, for example, they are found 15 years later off the cliffs of County Clare, or wherever they are found, the DNA remains, and the last person who owned the dead animal, whether dog or horse, will be subject to sanction because he or she can be identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Collins to the meeting and thank him for his submission on behalf of Horse Care Ireland.  I am interested in the issue of traceability, and in particular, the DNA situation which would apply to both the equine and canine issues that we have discussed.  As somebody who hailed from a farm and was fairly involved with sheep, albeit mountain sheep, I am aware of the huge damage that was done and is still being done by a minority of careless dog owners who do not secure their dogs, particularly at night, when these attacks occur.  In cases of the worrying of sheep, sometimes the sheep abort, are injured or killed.  That issue is perhaps not as prevalent as it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it still happens.  It is an important issue.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the equine industry, Mr. Collins made a point on the cost to society and the taxpayer in the case of dead animals being dumped or horses being sent to the knackery   It is much more significant than I had realised.  What does Mr. Collins envisage the cost being to a horse breeder or owner?  I am not talking about the likes of Shergar.  I refer to the people who are hobbyists and have perhaps seven or eight horses, ponies or even donkeys, and who are not making huge money out of it.  It is a hobby and they are very caring and loving to their animals.  They make sure they are looked after in winter and summer.  What sort of cost would be involved for a person in west Cork, for example, who perhaps has six or seven horses and a few donkeys, leaving out the canine side?  Will there be extra costs involved in delivering the traceability and microchipping of all animals?  Does Mr. Collins envisage there being extra costs for the farmers with this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#G00600","speaker":"1691"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The cost involved is absolutely prohibitive for many horse owners.  We want the introduction of a cost system that is similar to that of all other farm animals.  Bovine, ovine and porcine animals are all fully identifiable and traceable at a cost of less than &euro;5.  If I wanted to register a foal tomorrow morning, it would cost me between &euro;120 and &euro;130.  The fact that it is cost prohibitive is the single issue that has brought our horse industry to where it is today.  Only 48% of our horse population is identified.   Currently, 52% of the horse population is not identified.  These are the Department's own figures.  The main reason for that the horses are not identified is because it is cost prohibitive.  That cost is used a fundraising mechanism for the passport agencies.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must take back control with our proposed online passport system.  It is a system that will identify and trace both groups of animals but it must be at a cost of less than &euro;5.<\/p> <p>  I listened to the previous committee session with representatives from the Dogs Trust.

With regard to the costs to the Exchequer and the taxpayer, it would be useful if we were to delve a little into the reference to millions of euro having been lost due to horses being stamped out of the supply chain as a result of poor databases.  Will Mr. Collins explain how one relates to the other?  I imagine that we are talking about the uncertainty of, for example, a horse that is registered late or that there would be a lack of clarity on whether a horse had been treated with bute for inflammation and it would be stamped out.

In the case of a horse, the vet must come out to insert the microchip at a cost of &euro;60 or &euro;70.  The passport agency then gets anything from &euro;35 to &euro;60, depending on the pedigree status of the foal.  This is where the cost is coming from.  That does not happen across the other farming sectors.  The difficulty we have is that this level of identification is not necessary.  We want a level of identification that delivers for a farm animal.  We want the horse to be clarified as a farm animal in the beginning.  Later in its life, from a three-year-old upwards, if the horse enters the sport industry it comes under the remit of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  This is why there is a breakdown in the identification.  The horse has two different parts to its life.  We are concerned with the first part of the horse's life at farmyard level.

At that time, we were entitled to a run-in period, whereby the passport agency, which is Horse Sport Ireland, moved to remove 52,000 horses out of the food chain for late registration.  It was not for any medicinal reason; it was just for late registration.  The owners of those horses were never told that as a result of the regulation coming in on 1 July 2009 the horses would be sanctioned out of the food chain.  We were told that it would be illegal for the owner, but not that the animal would be sanctioned.  It was the owner who was to be sanctioned.  Because they were unidentified at the time those horses were supposed to be given a run-in period of six months, which we never got.  The Government did not give us this.  We did seek it.  Because that run-in period was not delivered, over the following 12 months some 52,000 horses were put out of the food chain for no other reason.  A horse that is out of the food chain runs up a bill of up to &euro;3,000 for the taxpayer.  This happens because if the horse is in the food chain and is fully processed and on the EU market, be it the French market or wherever, that horse is delivering more than &euro;2,050 for the Exchequer and the Irish economy.  That is lost if the horse does not make it to the food chain.  At the end of its life, before getting to the knackery, the horse may even travel through an animal welfare station.  The horse will end up in the knackery to be processed.  From the time the horse is delivered, through to the processing in the rendering plant, there is a cost of up to &euro;800 from start to finish, at the very minimum.  If you dig into those figures, it will not remain at &euro;3,000.  It will go much above that, but we are taking the lowest figure.  It is &euro;3,000 for each horse.  That can be multiplied by the number of horses that are out of the food chain for no medicinal reason.  How can the taxpayer lift that?  It is too much weight.

As the Chair said earlier, we need to seek clarification on the numbers of unregistered horses that have been mentioned because I would question that.  There may be confusion between the categorisation of thoroughbred, non-thoroughbred or whatever.  Thoroughbred foals that will be registered eventually do not have to be registered until 31 December of the year of their birth.  There is good reason for that.  The insertion of a microchip in a very young foal may hinder or stop that foal from suckling its mother.  Unless these figures can be massaged to reflect a time of year when many foals have not yet been registered, I would seriously question the numbers that have been mentioned here today.  We will seek clarification on that matter.<\/p> <p>  In their submissions and contributions, our guests have talked about the online passport.  Their submission referred to the concept of an online passport.  I would like further clarification as to where Horse Care Ireland is on this matter.  Has it done any worthwhile, thorough research on the possibilities?  Has it had any communication with the powers that be, including the Department, that might progress the implementation of the online passport?  Is it an issue on which our guests have done a lot of constructive work or is it, for want of a better word, a kind of pipe dream?  While our guests have referenced the other animals on the farm and how it works with traceability, I would point out a difference between cattle, sheep and horses.  I am on our guests' side and am playing devil's advocate here.  The difference is that nobody would buy a cow as a pet and nobody will put a sulky cart behind a cow.  A cow will be born onto a farm and will die there or be sold to another farmer, an abattoir or a meat plant.  It cannot be sold again without being registered.  However, some horses are not on farms.  People use horses for events or use them in different ways to farm animals.  While in theory it sounds good, as I said in the earlier session to the representatives from the Dogs Trust, it is easy to police the compliant, the problem is with the non-compliant.  The people who are not registering the horses now will still not comply with an online passport system.  A horse, of any category, must end its life somewhere.  If people are selling horses without a passport, that means people are buying horses with a passport.  Those are the real offenders and that is the root of our problem when it comes to untraceability and the issues we have within the horse community.<\/p> <p>  The debate over the past couple of minutes seems to have gone down an alley I did not foresee, that is, the exclusion of horse carcasses from the human food chain.  I do not see the relevance of that at all.  If we are solving the issue of unregistered and unlicensed horses, we cannot allow them into the food chain because other than identification, the main purpose of registering a horse through the horse licence is the recording of any veterinary medicines that are applied or administered to that horse during its life.  They all have to be recorded on the licence and if we do not have that record, we do not know what we are allowing into the food chain.  I am not of the opinion that opening up the inclusion of horse carcasses to the food chain will in any way be a solution to the problems we have with horse cruelty and the lack of registration of horses.<\/p><p>I do not know how we ended up going down that avenue and I am at a loss trying to follow that train of thought.  Will Mr. Collins elaborate on that?  Has work been done on the online passport or is it just a concept or an idea at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#J00800","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Nobody is advocating putting horses that are out for late registration back into the food chain.  There is another category of horses for which there are no figures, namely, horses that are out for medicinal treatment.  An unknown number of horses receiving medicinal treatment are out of the food chain.  Many of these horses are on holdings that are drawing farm payments.  They are considered a farm animal and the raising and breeding of horses is considered an agricultural activity.  There is nobody advocating putting horses where we cannot verify them.<\/p> <p>  Even in the case of horses that go into the food chain, when we compare them with other farm animals, audits for dairy and beef farm animals are carried out under the sustainable dairy assurance scheme, SDAS, and by Bord Bia, but no questions are asked about the medicinal treatment, traceability or registration of horses on the same farm holding and in the same enterprise.  Farm payments will be drawn down for the herd number and horses are on the farm.  As the Chairman has said, our online passport is entirely voluntary.  We have liaised with people with online expertise about how to do this.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to cattle registration, for instance, a calf can be registered in 20 days.  That cannot be done with a horse if there is DNA and a microchip because the microchip has to be inserted by the competent person.  Personally, I believe a farmer or breeder would be able to do that but, as matters stands, this is not allowed.  Nobody advocating putting horses back into the food chain.  It seems we do not want to have figures on the number of horses we have.  Horses are being registered without pedigree.  They could be of any breed, whether an Irish draught horse or a thoroughbred.  <\/p> <p>  Every enterprise that is sustainable has an entry and exit and we should improve the entire sector.  This year, we have three teams going to the Olympics.  They are not a reflection of the full industry.  We want to include everybody and make horse ownership affordable to everybody.  Horses are used for people with autism and special needs.  They are as good in their line of work as the horses going to the Olympics.  They have a world-class talent and DNA.  We should not front-load the price to disadvantage people.  Where there is a scheme, there are schemers.  Through ignorance and its application, the legislation has unintended consequences. <\/p> <p>  In the cattle sector, there is one central database and one entity deals with it on behalf of the Department.  It deals with all of the registrations.  There could be 40,000 calves registered within a week at peak times and the database can deal with that.  The number of horses being registered, both  thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred, is much smaller and they are registered over a large part of the year.  We want an online database that handles movements and registrations, as is the case with cattle and dogs.  People should have a registration number and be educated as regards ownership, be that for dogs or equines.  While people's hearts may be in the right place, the unintended consequence of owning a dog is that something might go wrong when the owner lets a dog go for a run while out for a walk.  If the dog does something wrong, is it the dog's fault or that of the owner?  <\/p> <p>  We have no interest in putting horses into the food chain that cannot be accounted for.  At the moment, medicinal treatment can be bought without prescription and given to a horse without the supervision of a vet.  The problem is that it may not be given to the horse to which it is supposed to be given.  If a horse is stamped out of the food chain, that horse can have medicinal treatment bought for it in compliance with the relevant regulations and with an appropriate passport because it is alive and well, on a holding and has an equine number.  However, phenylbutazone or bute can be administered to another horse, including by mistake.  Horses could eat out of the same feed containers and it could be administered through the feed.  Another horse could actually ingest the medicine.  When that horse goes for inspection, it will have a clean passport and will be eligible for the food chain.<\/p> <p>  We have owners in the upper end of the equine industry, both the thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred sectors, who have stamped horses out for medicinal treatment.  That is fine.  They can afford these horses and they can compete in the Curragh, the RDS or wherever.  If something goes wrong, however, why should the taxpayer subsidise these horses' end-of-life care if the owners who can afford to do so are knowingly putting them out of the food chain in order that they can administer whatever medicinal treatment is deemed necessary by the keeper on a given day?  Why should the taxpayer be potentially left facing a bill for a horse that the owner is fully capable of paying for to compete at international level?  At the end of its life, it is not worth anything.  What difference will it make to the taxpayer when nobody knows about it and the cost of caring for it is indirect cost?  Nobody realises the taxpayer pays that cost.  <\/p> <p>  We have an unknown number of horses, possibly running in the thousands.  There is more medicinal treatment on the competition side of the sector.  We have a big thoroughbred industry and a good number of horses competing in the non-thoroughbred sector.  It is in that side of the industry, rather than the breeding side, that more medicinal treatment is given.  That does not excuse anybody who makes that decision.  These people are drawing down farm payments of up to six-figure sums and areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments and it is the taxpayer who pays.  <\/p> <p>  Another point about the practice of stamping animals out of the food chain is that donkeys can be included for the purpose of drawing down farm payments, whereas horses were excluded at one stage.  That has created a problem because if anything happens to those animals, they have to be cared for by animal welfare.  For how many years into the future will that be a cost?  These farmers still have an entitlement of up to 50% for the ANC payments.  <\/p> <p>  We have several passport issuing offices in the current system.  We have no central hub or database, as exists for cattle.  That is the problem.  As long as we have that system in place, we will have fly-by-night operators, for want of a better term.  Front-loading the cost would mean a charge of between &euro;60 and &euro;80 to call out a vet and another &euro;62 plus &euro;22 charge for a pedigree passport.  The total cost would be nearly &euro;170.  The cost would be significantly higher for a thoroughbred horse.  The cheap option is to register the horse without any pedigree.  A thoroughbred horse can be registered as a non-thoroughbred animal.  There is also the issue for the stallion owner who has covered the mare and supplied the semen.  Stallion owners have no way of knowing if a live foal is born because they do not monitor what happens.  With a DNA base, where an animal cannot be registered without a DNA record, the person would be able to claim back the money to which he or she is entitled.  Some very good horses have been born and registered with white passports, as they are called, without any breeding being recorded.  Some have competed to a very high level in the sport horse industry.<\/p> <p> No one is advocating threatening food security.  We are trying to rehabilitate that.  All inspections, SDAS and everything else should include horses at farm level, the same as with cattle, and there should be a full record of medicinal treatment.  I hope that explanation brings clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021060100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mich&eacute;al Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>For the record, I am a thoroughbred owner and a member of owners' groups.

I must take issue with one of the comments made.<\/p><p>There was a warning about linking the dog licence and the microchip in terms of proof of ownership and increasing cost.  A dog licence costs &euro;20.  The current online system has the space for the microchip.  It is the law that the person selling the dog must microchip it.  There is no extra cost to the person who is buying the dog, whether they are getting it as a result of a rescue or from a dog breeder.  The law says you cannot sell or supply a dog that has not been microchipped in advance.  Even then, the microchip costs &euro;20.  Linking the two does not increase those costs.  What it does is ensures that some rogue individual can go to an animal welfare place, finds a dog it likes the look of, goes online, downloads a licence and then walks up and says &quot;That's my dog&quot;, which is what is happening.  It is happening regularly because there is no verification process around the dog licensing.  Anyone can go online and just pay for a licence and get it.<br\/><br\/>The proposal in this regard is very well thought out.  A very reputable dog welfare organisation has informed me that this is an issue, including when it goes to court in respect of animal welfare breaches.  Unless the two are linked, there is a real issue regarding proof of ownership.  You are obliged to have a microchip, you are obliged to have a licence, but it is the licence that is proof of ownership.  I just wanted to clarify that.  I am not <i>au fait<\/i>with how it works with horses and so on.  There is no extra cost involved.  This is just bringing the two things together so that there is cohesion.<br\/><br\/>I am familiar with the work of My Lovely Horse, an animal welfare organisation.

These are not just in respect of horses, but those relating to horses are predominant.

While all schools are now obliged to have an anti-bullying policy, it requires serious and continuous attention to ensure that school personnel are aware of the ever-increasing catalogue of ways in which bullying can occur, particularly cyberbullying.  Where once the victim had the sanctuary of home at least when bullying might have occurred at school or elsewhere, now they are only a click away from those causing their discomfort and stress at any time, day or, particularly, night.<br\/><br\/>Research by the Dublin City University, DCU, National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre reveals that cyberbullying incidents have soared in number during lockdown.  Research has also shown the severe impact of bullying on the victim, their friends and family, those who witness the bullying, and even on the perpetrator.  Mental health issues can result, including social isolation, stress, anxiety, depression, and even psychotic episodes and suicide.  Physically, heart disease and other serious illness may be the consequences of bullying.<br\/><br\/>While we usually think of bullying at school as being between children, it can happen at every other interface between people.  School leaders can be bullied by staff members or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Teachers, special needs assistants, ancillary staff and parents can be victims or perpetrators like anyone else.  If unchecked, it can have a devastating effect on the well-being of those involved and on school morale in general.<br\/><br\/>The IPPN suggests a number of measures that will help to reduce the likelihood of bullying and its many consequences.  More support is required for school leaders and boards with HR and the development of an appropriate dignity at work policy to ensure everyone can attend school free of potential bullying situations.  Updated resources and continuing professional development, CPD, must be available on cyberbullying, racist bullying and homophobic, transphobic and gender-based bullying.  A stand-alone policy to counter racism should be in every school and templates must be developed to support schools with this.  As part of a centrally-approved and updated anti-bullying programme, emotional counselling and therapeutic supports for victims and perpetrators, and appropriate CPD would benefit all schools.  A fully trained staff member is required in each school, with allocated time as a behaviour support teacher, to provide support and guidance, and to liaise with external agencies.<br\/><br\/>Through our IPPN leadership support service, since September 2017, we have advised on 25 cases of bullying among children and 29 adult workplace grievance procedure-type cases.  Many of the school cases do not arrive on our desks.  School leaders are often left to deal with staff bullying problems, which should be the remit of the board or even the management body.  Research carried out for the IPPN and the NAPD by Dr. Philip Riley shows that school principals experience nearly twice the incidence of threats and actual physical violence at work than other population groups, with a higher incidence rate for female principals.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, a multi-departmental approach is required to strategically explore the development of multidisciplinary teams in and around schools to focus on bullying and other emotional needs of children, and to provide support for pupils and their families who experience socio-economic inequalities that may result in bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian White"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I am the principal of Ramsgrange Community School in County Wexford since 2013 and the incoming president of the NAPD.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to this topic today.  I will briefly speak to three headings, namely, bullying procedures in schools, the impact of Covid and what needs to be addressed to proactively support schools that are incredibly proactivearound promoting anti-bullying behaviour.<\/p> <p>  According to the Department of Education, responsibility for tackling bullying in school falls to the level of each individual school.  The anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools, as have been well documented and discussed here, were published almost eight years ago in September 2013.  Society and the educational landscape have changed almost beyond recognition since then so I call for an urgent review of these procedures.<\/p><p>In all our schools anti-bullying campaigns, positive behaviour strategies, restorative practices, etc., highlight behaviours that may be more obvious such as name-calling, exclusion and even general pushing and shoving.  Most schools are aware of these behaviours and are well equipped to deal with them.<\/p><p> Looking, however, at the past 15 months and the overnight move to the online space, it has been far more difficult to monitor bullying and bullying behaviour.  Schools have had to play catch-up in respect of online etiquette, rules and guidelines for all stakeholders.  A major issue with the anti-bullying procedures of 2013 is that schools are responsible for dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.  Bullying that occurs online and outside of school gives no boundaries to the remit of the responsibility of the school.  That is a very large task and very different from what schools faced in 2013.  Schools need to be adequately resourced to face the modern-day challenges of preventing bullying and promoting positive behaviour.  Appropriate investment is needed to support parents to resource an effective link between home and school to identify, call out and tackle the issue.<\/p><p> The fallout from Covid, the move to the online space and the impact on mental health has exposed a lot of shortcomings in mental health services for students.  The reality is that schools can plug the gap of the lack of intervention supports only for so long.  There are cases in which expert treatment and intervention is essential, and schools do not have the resources to tackle these situations.  The focus of schools should be on prevention rather than intervention.  More resources should be allocated to schools.  As the Department of Education is engaging in the new digital learning strategy, why not ring-fence some of that money for targeted online cyberbullying prevention?  NAPD, nationally, is gravely concerned about access to youth mental health supports.  I can speak about my region, the south east, where there is a lack of expert intervention and supports outside of school.  I will name but a couple of examples.  There is one full-time child and adolescent psychiatrist position in Wexford, which has yet to be filled in a permanent capacity.  This has been the case for several years now.  CAMHS is under-resourced and is failing to meet the needs of our vulnerable students, particularly students who fall between the ages of 16 and 18.  I am aware of colleagues who have had cases which have been referred through a GP after self-harm, suicidal ideation or threats of violence to themselves or others and who have been told there is a waiting list of between eight to 12 months.  I am also aware of three parents in the past 12 to 18 months who have resorted to bringing their children to accident and emergency departments and refusing to leave until their children were prioritised to be seen by a member of a CAMHS team.  However, even when students have been through the CAMHS process and received a diagnosis, there is no link-in with the school and no follow-up in the form of school-based support.  In such circumstances many must turn to Pieta House for help.  CAHMS, in its letter, states that it has no expertise in education.  A determination as to the child's care or educational needs in the school setting can be made only by the relevant professionals in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  In the past two years, in my school in Ramsgrange, we have had no NEPS as our fantastic psychologist has been on maternity leave.  The school is then assigned assessments by the scheme for the commissioning of psychological assessments, SCPA, but most find there is a severe shortage of people who are willing to complete these, mostly due to our geographical location.  In the past academic year alone my school was sanctioned two SCPA assessments.  We approached 12 psychologists from the prescribed list and we failed to get anybody to complete these assessments.  NEPS needs to be resourced adequately to cater for 2021 demands.  Occupational therapist services in Wexford are currently working through their January 2018 list, which means some children will be on that list for five years before they are seen.<\/p><p> To finish where I began, our schools aredoing fantastic work providing the \"one good adult\", which suits most students, but we need help.  Our students and society at large need help now.  Our schools are at the coalface.  Educators are experiencing the societal fallout from Covid and will do so for the school generation to come.  I call for more investment in restorative practices and supports to create a culture of dialogue and openness in our schools.  I am happy to expand on any issues raised in my opening remarks as well as the February submission made on behalf of NAPD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to be here with the committee.  I will provide a little context.  The ACCS is a management body for 96 post-primary schools right across the country.  Ms O'Connor is the principal of one of those schools.  It is great to see her here.  Our schools involve a joint patronage model and are very democratic in their set-up.  At the core of the inclusive nature of our schools is our provision of a comprehensive education for all the children of the community.  That is provided for in our deed of trust, which established our schools.<\/p> <p>  Today's topic of school bullying and its impact on mental health is a significant cause for concern for many across the education sector.  Ms O'Connor has referred to a lot of the legislation and the procedures that are in place.  Going back to the fundamental legislation, the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, there are the guidelines issued by the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, and, from 2013, the anti-bullying procedures for post-primary schools.  All of these identify key personnel and were at that time useful in many ways.  The concept of the relevant teacher and the identification of relevant personnel in particular areas; the need for agreed strategies across schools; school procedures for dealing with investigations; follow-up recording of bullying behaviour; and the role of the boards of management were all provided for in those documents.<\/p> <p>  Probably the most significant pieces among all those, though, are the promotion of a positive school culture; a climate in which people can feel free to speak out; and the question of how to try to manage conflict of this nature within the school while engaging the entire school community.  A key comment made by one of our principals, who has been very much part of the research involved in a lot of what we do and is referred to in the submission we made, is that bullying will not thrive in a school where people can talk openly.  People will feel free to talk openly and honestly where there is a climate of acceptance and a culture of respect.  Ms O'Connor and Mr. White have both said that schools are doing tremendous work in this regard and are being supported in many ways by voluntary organisations outside.  Ms O'Connor mentioned the \"one good adult\" that Jigsaw provides, which has now moved on to the \"one good school\" project.  These are all hugely supportive but they are not systemic.  We are depending on the support of these initiatives on a voluntary basis.<\/p> <p>  Creating this climate is a considerable amount of work for schools.  What does it involve?  We have programmes in place, and over recent years curricular change has taken place such as in the area of social, personal and health education, well-being, and the development of positive transition programmes between primary and post-primary to make sure that students entering the school are inducted in a positive way.  However, significant training for staff is required.  There is a strong emphasis in a lot of schools on restorative practices and trying to facilitate the student voice.  Going back to the comment made by the principal to whom I referred, they are very much involved with the Lundy model and in the idea of the circle and in trying to provide safe spaces for students to be able to engage and to be involved.  We in the ACCS, as a management body, have been involved with the NCCA and UCC for the past two years on a significant project about the student voice.  We are just about to produce a journal on that which we would be very happy to share with the members of the committee when it comes in.  While the student voice has got a hell of a lot more to do than just address bullying, its power and the transformative nature the student voice can have within school communities cannot be overestimated.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. White and Ms O'Connor: we have looked at the traditional - if that is the correct word - forms of bullying involving an intention of harm, repetition over time and a power imbalance.  However, the whole area of cyberbullying has exploded in recent years.  Mr. White and Ms O'Connor have referred to research.  We have more research again referenced in our submission to the committee about the numbers involved.  The Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht recently reviewed the online safety and media regulations Bill and brought in students from two of our schools.  Their research, which was pretty much up to date as they prepared for those talks, was very consistent with everything we are hearing today.  They would say that around 16% of students have experienced direct bullying online and that 26% of students have witnessed bullying online.  That is all consistent with what we are hearing from EU research, DCU and the WHO.  They came up with excellent recommendations for that committee as to how we might address some of the issues, and it might be worth liaising between the committees and taking a joint approach across them.

One of the common misperceptions is that, under the 2013 guidelines, schools have to deal with issues that arise inside of school and carry on outside of school, but the guidelines state that schools are responsible for dealing with issues that happen outside of school that have a negative impact inside of school.  In other words, the issue carries over.  It could happen at the Saturday night disco or on Snapchat at 9 o'clock on a Friday night.  It is not necessarily the case that there is too much emphasis or onus on schools but that schools need to be supported in supporting parents in that space.<br\/><br\/>In terms of tackling bullying and in terms of being preventative in mental health, we need a partnership approach.  Schools need to be resourced to support parents.  They should not have to bat issues back to parents on the basis that they are <i>in loco parentis<\/i>for 167 days of the year between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. and that, outside of school hours, they are not getting involved.  If a matter is having a negative impact in school, there is some onus on the school.  It is the boundaries of that that are at issue.  We need to support parents.  Our school is in its third year of its restorative practice journey.

Much of what was said by previous speakers is reflected in primary schools as well.  Children are more aware of their rights now.  In our school and, I am sure in every other school, the UN Charter of Rights is displayed for every child to see.  As I said, children are more aware of their rights.  Whatever applies to the older children applies at primary level also.  That culture and openness starts with the principal.  The school has to have an open door policy, but a parent must be an approachable adult, must not seek to lay the blame with anybody and must be willing to come to an agreement on how to solve the problem.  It is important when bullying or any incident arises that it is addressed early.  If a parent comes into my office, I will walk him or her up the corridor towards where the problem lies and we start at it straight away.

I think specifically of home school community liaison staff but also, to some extent, perhaps school completion officers.

For too long we have not had the broadest idea of what education means.  I would love to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on what we are imparting to children through these programmes that they can take with them after school, for the rest of their lives, in terms of their mental health and how to have resilience in an ever-changing society.

That has been discussed at previous sessions of this committee.  It would plug a gap in so many ways.  Many children are experiencing food poverty.  It was never clearer than during the pandemic when there was serious appreciation for the food that was distributed by schools and the fact that schools set it up.  An Post and various voluntary agencies helped in every way they could.  Food is vital for everything.  A child who comes to school in bad humour and does not get any decent food during the day will not be easy to teach in the evening, no matter what level they are at &ndash; from junior infants to sixth year.  It makes a difference if they get a nutritious meal during the day.  The committee acknowledged in previous hearings that food should be available during holidays.  We are a reasonably well-off country and we should be able to support the neediest children and get them to the point where they are out in society and can make decisions for themselves.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly mentioned wider society and where we should be going.  What we are trying to do is create global citizens in school.  They get a rounded experience in school.  They get good example from staff.  The way staff and pupils interact is probably miles different from when I was in school.  It is less hierarchical and there is much more consultation.  There are committees within schools.  Even in primary school now there are student councils where ideas are taken on and accepted and people can see the power of negotiation.

Senator O'Reilly is dead right: it is more about education.  When we look at the sociology of education, we are also talking about schooling.  The amount of schooling that takes place while students are with us on a day-to-day basis is beyond recognition.  It is not just about the delivery of a curriculum.  To go back to the restorative practice piece again, as educators we cannot take for granted that the teenagers in front of us know how to have a two-way conversation and know how to give and receive feedback.  The Senator hit the nail on the head with her point about resilience, because now they are taking responsibility for their actions, they can acknowledge where they went wrong, and they are coming to the conversation focused on a solution.  There is a really important piece there in terms of life skills when they leave school with something in their back pockets, even if that is to have a two-way conversation, which is really powerful.  At times, they have to learn how to be number two.<\/p><p>It is not all about winning.<\/p><p> In terms of good nutrition, I absolutely agree.  I have been in post for eight years and I have seen kids and met students for whom school is the only place where they get fed during the day.  That is the stark reality of it.  We are a DEIS school, so we have school meals provision.  Everyone is entitled to a free breakfast and lunch.  The students who are involved in after-school activities also get fed.  According to Maslow before Bloom, our kids need to feel safe, they need to be fed and to have a warm and secure place before they can start learning.  Schools play that vital role.  That is often overlooked, not by the committee but by society at large.

I confirm I am in Leinster House.  As I have said, we have been having these meetings for quite a number of weeks now, and every week we get increasingly impressive contributions.  I am always advised not to say it, but I was a school principal for a time.  The point Senator O'Reilly made is a most important one.  As we all know, bullying comes from a place of deep unhappiness.  Most of the conflicts I dealt with with children, whether in the case of bullying or negative interactions, would have been with children who were hungry.  Before getting into who had done what, if I asked them a very simple question, namely, whether they had had their breakfast that morning, more often than not they would not have had their breakfast.  They would not have had anything to eat since whatever time on the previous night.  It may have been 12 hours since they had eaten something.  Therefore, a teacher is always aware of issues as basic as food, the comfort of the child in the classroom and whatever is going on at home.  If the child is comfortable in his or her own skin and is feeling secure, he or she is less likely to lash out.  Having said that, bullying does not come exclusively from a place of poverty.  There are any number of middle-class children who also engage in it.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses the following in turn.  In respect of the online space, is it the witnesses' view that bullying has moved online or that it is an extra layer on top of what they are already dealing with?  Previous contributors to this committee have stated there is a lack of data and that schools need to provide more data as to the nature of bullying, for example, in respect of the age, gender and ethnicity profiles.  Would the witnesses agree with that?  How can we deal with that?  I also ask the witnesses to speak to the need for a specific racism policy in schools and more guidance from the Department.  Some schools have policies and procedures that are outdated.  The witnesses have spoken about waiting lists of 12 to 18 months for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  With those questions in mind, I would appreciate the responses of the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#E00500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I will go first again.  I acknowledge the Deputy's final point on racism.  It is an area in respect of which I have come out quite strongly in a few public forums.  We do not just need to have a racism policy, we need to have anti-racism policies.  When we look at what is happening in the world and what has happened over the past 18 months, two years or five years, there has been an increase in racist attacks and crimes across the world.  As a country, we should be, and can be, an exemplar in this area if each school has an anti-racism policy which is a stand-alone policy.  We have around six key policies.  The issue of racism comes under the scope of bullying and some other policies.  There should be a stand-alone policy.  I am firmly convinced of that.  It would go a long way, particularly where children help to develop the policy within schools, to make racism something that is completely unacceptable and that people do not even understand in the next generation.  That is my sincere hope in respect of the issue of racism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian White"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I wish to ask a follow-up question.

Going back to the Deputy's first point on bullying in the online space, I agree it has been prolific in the past 15 months.  However, in my experience over the past 15 months, what I was dealing with in school moved to the online space, and when we came back to school it moved back into school and the physical space, give or take a certain percentage.  We have all of our systems in place, all of my staff are trained in restorative practice, we have our student support team and everything in place in the physical space in the building.  However, when we moved to the online space, we were told overnight to change our practices and move online, but there was no supporting material, guidelines, or etiquette.  Principals were sitting at their laptops, coming up with etiquette.  It is much more difficult to monitor, intervene and, for example, to get two teenagers and parents involved to resolve bullying issues online.  Bullying happens continuously, but it ebbs and flows.  It was exacerbated by the fact we were working remotely.<\/p> <p>  In respect of data, I agree completely with the Deputy.  At every board of management meeting I attend, I provide data.  They are not broken down as the Deputy has proposed, but I state how many cases of bullying have occurred, if they have been resolved, and if they have not been resolved since the previous board meeting, I outline why this has not happened.  I must justify that as a school leader.  The data sit with the board of management.  I do not understand why they are not sent somewhere else or why they are not gathered by the Department for analysis to get real raw data to put supports and resources in place for schools.

The witnesses will know that it takes time to create a culture of zero tolerance to bullying behaviours in a school to enable everybody within that school environment to feel safe.  The more bureaucracy and demands placed on teachers within the school environment, the more difficult it is to create a positive culture.  I have seen it done, but it has been done more in spite of the situation than because of the resources, recognition or supports provided to the schools.  We have models of very good practice.<\/p> <p>  A couple of things stand out for me.  It was cited earlier that a fully trained member of staff should be available with allocated time as a behaviour support teacher.  I agree that would be a really good idea.  Do the witnesses foresee that teacher having teaching responsibilities as well and, if so, how can that be done?  Often, somebody is appointed to a particular role, but realistically he or she does not have the time to do what is needed to do the job properly.  I ask the witnesses to address the issue of time.  It was also suggested by Mr. Irwin of the ACCS that schools should have access to a psychotherapist or a counsellor.  I agree those therapies are certainly not available within the schools when they are needed, but is that a reasonable ask?  What is the cost to the school in education terms of not having those personnel appointed or allocated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#F00600","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I will address the first question.  The reality is that the appointment of a person to that type of position would require bespoke solutions for different types of schools and so on.  There are schools with 25 or 26 children and others with 1,000 children.  The solution would have to be index linked.  It is unrealistic to expect that schools would have a teacher totally devoted to this area.  We appreciate that we cannot have everything we want.  As part of the allocation for special educational needs, additional time could be allocated for a person to deal with that work specifically.  For example, in an average sized school of 200 children, there would be an allocated time during the week when the appointed person would not have teaching duties and would be able to attend to such matters with the support of the principal.  It would make a significant difference.  Schools would be able to deal with matters in a considered and less emotional way.  Sometimes when an incident arises in a classroom it is difficult to address it because there are other children present and so on.  The teacher has to deal with everything as well as the particular incident.  When there is a person available who is a step removed it makes things easier and more considered.  An allocation of time specifically for dealing with behaviour and such issues is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian White"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Irwin to comment on schools' access to counsellors and other supports such as psychotherapists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#F00800","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>As a management body, the ACCS supports the NCSE pilot projects in regard to supports for schools.

Some of the larger schools are investing and buying in expertise in terms of therapies.  I gave an example earlier of psychotherapy provision in one of the schools.  That school finds that provision invaluable.  When a person is dealing with a mental health issue a specialist skill set is required to support him or her.  The same applies with regard to the therapies.  I refer to the Cluny centre for children with autism.  We found it very difficult in our health area to get access to occupational or speech therapies so we purchased that provision.  If the desired result is inclusive education, we have to support that.  Inclusive education is not cheap.  It is very expensive.  To achieve the best outcome, we have to invest.  I believe every school in the country should have access to a psychotherapist, although not on a daily basis.

The biggest issue with them is that they are not bespoke.

Much of the bullying was low-level stuff so required little intervention.  In terms of the more serious type of incidents, I never felt fully trained up or prepared to deal with many of instances that presented themselves over the years.<\/p> <p>   My next question on data is for all three of the witnesses.  There is legislation coming through in Northern Ireland that will oblige the Department for Education to compile the data that was discussed earlier.  I suppose they will make use of it whether it is, to target any response or support at specific schools and areas where there is a demonstrable problem or a surge in bullying behaviour, cyberbullying or whatever.  Can I take it from what the witnesses have said that they broadly support something?  Would they support a similar initiative here whereby somebody in the Department of Education would be responsible for data collection?  As they said, at many board of management meetings, that data on the various types of bullying instances is probably being hoarded across the country.  The big thing about the legislation in the North, which will be brought in, is that it details the specifics of the bullying accusation so whether it is gender-oriented, based on somebody's sexual orientation, ethnicity-based or whatever the case may be.

In a more common-sense way, Mr. Irwin said that we should have a psychologist when one is needed.  That is so simple yet it could make a big difference.<\/p> <p>  Over the weeks there has been a great deal of emphasis on cyberbullying and it is clear that cyberbullying is a new issue.  It has always been the case that bullying happens where adults are not present.  We must equip children with tools but there is something qualitatively different about cyberbullying as it can travel inside and outside of the school gates, it can travel over weekends and it can travel countrywide in a short time.<\/p> <p>  I echo the comment Ms O'Connor made about youth mental health services, CAMHS and NEPS.

As well as having one good adult, we need an adult like me, which has been referenced.

The religion and sexual orientation issues come back to the ethos in some of the schools and they are still a barrier.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the matter.

My experience, as a principal on secondment from a Catholic school I will be going back to in September, is that no child who ever came through the door was made uncomfortable because of religion, race or anything else.  Everyone was welcome and we made provision and always will for children who are of different faith or persuasion in any way.<\/p> <p>  On staffrooms and teachers who are alternative in their own way, I think staffrooms are generally welcoming places.  The atmosphere in the vast majority of staffrooms is very good.  At primary level, everybody is trained to teach the same thing so it is easy to focus everyone's mind on the same thing.  At second level, it breaks down to subjects and subject areas but primary teachers have to work together in a successful school.  It is the same at secondary but particularly in our case.  There is no room for that kind of thing.  There may be someone here or there who has an experience that suggests otherwise but, as a principal and knowing as many principals as I do, it would not be tolerated that any teacher be made uncomfortable.<\/p> <p>  I referenced adult bullying in my submission.  I said it happens.  Wherever there is an interface between people, adult bullying can happen and somebody can be made to feel uncomfortable for whatever reason.  We have supported, I think, 29 cases involving adult bullying over the last five years with our supports and services.  That would not detail all of those cases.  A principal has to stand up and make a decision around who teaches what class, or what class a child is allocated to.  Parents will come in, there may be an interaction and it might not be pleasant at times.   We are trained and we deal with it and de-escalate wherever we can to return it to normal.  In normal circumstances, it sorts itself out.  There are occasions, however, where principals feel threatened.  There is no denying that.  It has happened and does happen.  We deal with it and support those where it has happened.  It is an issue principals deal with.<\/p> <p>  On where that research came from, Dr. Phil Riley looked at principals' health a couple of years ago.

Coming immediately out of Covid, what supports do we need to have in place for September?<\/p> <p>  I sit on the Oireachtas media committee and had the privilege of listening to those students from Tallaght and Kinsale talking about the online safety and media regulation Bill.  It is an important piece of legislation.  We are talking about establishing an online safety commissioner as part of the media commission.  It will regulate the tech companies.  Mr. Irwin, Ms O'Connor and Mr. White might want to express what they want to see in that legislation with regard to the regulation of social media.<\/p> <p>  Much of the focus has been on the pressure students face, but I am conscious of the pressure staff often face.  Students told us the staff may not have a clue about the challenge of social media.  Ms O'Connor mentioned Snapchat; I would say a fair number of teachers may not understand what Snapchat is.  I was struck by the case of a good school in Carlow where allegations were made that certain things were said.  Suddenly, there was a social media frenzy and pile-on that was completely unfair to male teachers in that school.  It was appalling and it took off and spread around the world.  This is about a responsibility to truth.  Will the witnesses talk in that context about the challenges facing teachers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#H00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I will speak to the first couple of items.  I have already asked and spoken to the Minister on this but if I was to meet with her in the morning on senior cycle reform, I would say we really need to end the overemphasis on end-of-term assessment in the leaving certificate.  We need to engage in more continuous assessment and look at other ways of assessing our students that would place them appropriately after the leaving certificate.<\/p><p>It cannot be all based on a three-hour exam.  The mental health impact that has on our students is profound and we need to reassess that.  I am aware that process is happening.  My biggest fear is that much of that review took place pre-Covid.  There almost needs to be an addendum to the review to take into account the impact on students during the Covid period.  <\/p><p> In terms of the challenges of immediately taking over post Covid, NEPS was very clued in on the need for connection over content as we move forward.  That period of minding everybody and of reconnecting with people needs to be carried forward for a little while but therein lies the issue.  NEPS is very good at helping us.  It moved from an inspection model to a support model during Covid.  As school leaders, we welcomed that.  That needs to continue.  If we are promoting connection over content, we need help, support and advice on how to do that but, unfortunately, we are teaching to an exam model.  There needs to be a strategic way of looking at the next generation of school students with respect to how we will mind them through the system and place them appropriately afterwards.  Those would be my biggest concerns post-Covid.  We have to mind them but we have to get the course covered. There is the issue of how we balance that as we are not resourced to do it as effectively as we possibly can.

It is archaic in many respects and it is very limiting in the range of abilities it tests.  It has improved in recent years as subject specifications have tended to take in another component other than what we call the terminal exam, which is an awful name.  At a recent debate on assessment, one area was raised where people should be challenged, namely, what it says about how accessible assessment is in this country when we have to put in reasonable accommodation for a significant number of candidates.  People should ask how accessible is our assessment model if one of the key cornerstones in it is RACE.  Many of us who have worked in schools know how difficult it is and how much work goes into that space in preparing the RACE applications.  It is something to consider.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the other joint committee the Senator is a member of, I liked the dichotomy students described.

I will pick up on the social media issues and ask a devil's advocate-type question.  I note from the NAPD's submission the need for a separate and exhaustive investigation into the abuse of social media, its destructive bullying and the impact on young people&rsquo;s mental health.  In this culture we live in where there is a strong emphasis on nurturing of people and minding people&rsquo;s mental health, and the unfairness of bullying behaviour, I wonder if bullying is a small subset of a wider problem about the abuse of social media.  Young people&rsquo;s experience of social media can involve exhaustion, sleep deprivation, unrealistic aspirations about life, negative body image, and perhaps over sexualisation or desensitisation to violence.  Some of those issues are connected to bullying but many are not.  Is bullying the minor theme and are social media and its various problems the major theme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#J01000","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>For us in schools, bullying is a very major theme.  All of those others things are contributing to the normal sea of certain behaviours that in the past we would not have accepted or seen as being acceptable.  People can hide behind the security of a screen and it is amazing what people would do behind a screen that they would not do in public.  Bullying is a major constituent part.<\/p><p>A footballer recently took a case against a teenager who racially abused him over a game of virtual soccer that the teenager was playing.  The player had nothing to do with the goal not being scored, yet he was racially abused.  That kind of behaviour is in wider society but it is a form of bullying.  It was bullying to the victim.  We are considering the wider point but bullying, specifically, is a massive issue.  It is at second level but also at primary level.  We are dealing with it.  Now and again, it crops up in almost every school.<\/p><p> It can crop up in games.  There are games in which children in two different houses can dress up dolls.  I have heard of serious cases of bullying in a child&rsquo;s game that simply involves dressing dolls.  A child might say he or she is going to make a doll look like another child who is not present to defend himself or herself and does not know what is being said about him or her.

In my office, I have to deal with parents and guardians who are bereft over Johnny being online until 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. and the impact it is having on him.  I did not have a clue what the game Fortnite was.  All the students in the school were obsessed with it.  One of the times that most impacted our students was when Fortnite went offline for no reason for 24 or 48 hours.  The impact was because of students' dependency on interacting with others online and engaging in this game.  I will never forget it.  Social media in itself, aside from the bullying aspect, is having a massive impact.  Students are digital natives; we are digital migrants.

In conversations I have had in my office, I have said to mothers and fathers that they should please just turn off the Wi-Fi.  The Wi-Fi can be turned off from 9 p.m. and parental controls can be used.  Parents can control the device in the house and have full access.  However, they have a fear about their capacity to do that because they are operating in a space in which they are not 100% comfortable.  It is the role of the school to create awareness but it is impossible for us to educate all parents in this space.  It is our job to create awareness and point parents in the right direction to find support.  The parent section on Webwise is incredibly informative.

I did not know much about it until about 12 months ago but I could now give her a good, solid education on it and, I am not ashamed to say, the rows it causes in my house and, I would think, every other house.<\/p> <p>  I feel very strongly about this issue.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh for his remarks on my raising this subject as Chair.  We put a great deal of work into it.  I also thank the clerk to the committee and assistant clerk to the committee for the amount of work they have put into it.  I feel very strongly about it.  Every member of the committee feels equally strongly about it.  Over recent months, it has been like opening up Pandora's box.  What has sprung up at each meeting has been very interesting.  I have no doubt that we will have a comprehensive and interesting report when we conclude our hearings.<\/p> <p>  Several witnesses, both today and at previous meetings, have called for anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools to be updated.  The committee published a report on the impact of Covid-19 on primary and secondary education recently.  It recommends the updating of the guidelines to include homophobic and transphobic bullying.  It will be interesting to hear from the witnesses whether they would like other forms of bullying to be included in the revised guidelines.  <\/p> <p>  In its report, the committee recommends that emotional and therapeutic supports be provided in all schools.  I do not expect the Department of Education to roll that out tomorrow morning in every school but there should be a public programme.  I have stated this at previous committee meetings.  Others have also sought a pilot programme.  I do not refer to a role for a career guidance teacher but to dedicated emotional and therapeutic supports in primary and post-primary schools.  They would help to alleviate pressure on teachers who may not feel they have the specific qualifications to address the issues that arise.  Could we have a brief reply from the three witnesses on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#K00900","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Homophobic and transphobic bullying have probably come to the fore relatively recently.  Perhaps they always existed but they have become more evident recently.  There might be a development of older forms of bullying, such as slagging people off because of the clothes they wear or their fashion sense.  They may be slagged off where their appearance, lunch or whatever indicates very evident poverty.  These kinds of things have moved on but old-fashioned bullying is encountered and must be dealt with at school.<\/p><p>It is an ever-changing scene.  As teachers, we have to keep up with it.  We have called for continuing professional development, CPD, so that all teachers would be able to recognise it when those kinds of bullying incidents happen.  I think someone said earlier that teachers are not always aware of what is going on with social media and so on.  Through CPD, which we could all get on a reasonably regular basis, we would be able to notice and stop something in its infancy.  I think that would help.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned emotional support and therapeutic services.  A pilot is always a great way of getting a snapshot of how things can roll out.  Many different agencies have operated pilots, including the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and various other bodies.  They give a snapshot.  One can see what things would be like if they were applied on a broader scale.  I welcome the support of this committee for emotional and therapeutic supports.  The sooner a pilot could be put in place, the better.<\/p><p> I would encourage people to look at things from a primary school's point of view.  Obviously, there are many small schools and, therefore, things apply slightly differently.  However, in the parish where I live, we have six small schools, all with teaching principals.  The word &ldquo;bespoke&rdquo; has been used a lot here.  Perhaps something bespoke to that kind of situation could be developed in order to see how one could apply those kinds of supports across a range of small schools.  A number of different solutions are probably necessary.  I would certainly love to see a pilot, because we can learn much in a year with a pilot, and a year is a short enough time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian White","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I absolutely agree in terms of the procedures.

In a school like mine, there is a full spectrum of economic backgrounds, of abilities and of disabilities.  It is important that awareness is created in that space, too.  We should go back to basics on the use of derogatory language among our teenagers, such as calling people &ldquo;gay&rdquo;, or &ldquo;a bender&rdquo; and other really horrible derogatory terms that are used on a daily basis in the yard.  We should go back to zero tolerance on that.  We should almost retrain the vernacular of our teenagers.  This is an important piece of this.  It is a good and simple place to start to create awareness.<\/p> <p>  When the new guidelines, Children First, were launched, every teacher in the country had to complete a professional development service for teachers, PDST, and a Tusla e-learning course.  There is no reason that the PDST cannot be mandated to do a \"bullying first\", bullying intervention, or bullying awareness programme, whereby before coming back to school, every teacher in the country would have to sit down for an hour or two to complete an online e-learning course.  Then we would be well on the way to creating awareness and to putting it back into schools and staff rooms, so that we can start having conversations about the impact of bullying.  We have to name it to tame it.  If we do not know about it, we cannot do anything about it.  It is timely to do simple, actionable things to create awareness around this important topic.

It is hard for a walking principal in a very large primary school to identify some of what is going on.

Parents play an important role when it comes to bullying.  When I was going to school, and it is still happening, there were students bullying teachers, students bullying students, and teachers bullying students.  That happened, and it is still happening.  It is one of the reasons I have such a huge interest in this.  Parents have an important role to play here.  If their son or daughter is identified as the bully, parents often do not want to know about it.  They refuse to even engage with the school on it.  Often, parents are slow to come forward when their son or daughter is being bullied because, maybe, they do not have the confidence to come to the school.  Parents have a huge role here.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is educating parents on cyberbullying.  I did a booklet a number of years ago, and I got the copyright from Deputy Alan Farrell.  I gave it to schools.  A huge number of schools came back to me afterwards, asking me to print more for parents.  The amount of feedback I got back from parents was huge.  I was blown away by it, because they did not understand Snapchat, Facebook, and maybe less Twitter.  There were social media platforms that they were not aware of, as well as the meanings and the dangers of them.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are dead right when they talk about parents.  Parents have spoken to me about their children being on social media at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  I would not be able to operate the next day if I was up until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., or lying awake in bed at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., let alone a student who needs sleep.  This is a huge problem.  Could the witnesses give a tip on what this committee could do, or what could be done, to make parents more aware of the dangers of social media because I can tell them that parents' sons or daughters are not going to tell them about its dangers?  They have to educate themselves.  It is difficult to leave it up to the school principal or the board of management to make the parents aware of it, or to run public meetings, or whatever.  Is there anything specific that the witnesses would like to add that would make parents more aware of the dangers of social media?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#L00700","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>It starts with creating awareness.  I am absolutely banging my head against a wall.  If I organise an information session for families in the middle of the day, working families cannot attend.  If I organise it at 7 p.m., it is bedtime or dinner time and parents cannot attend.  If I organise it later at night, there will be people who work night shifts.<\/p><p>It is not possible to get everybody.  The sign-up to parental talks on issues other than subject choice, etc., is very low.  The committee can start by creating awareness.  There are wonderful resources available, such as Webwise.  I know from teachers on my staff who are parents and attend the cyber-bullying training we provide for our students that their minds are blown by how many new developments there are every year and, aside from all the positives, that there are so many different dangers and threats for teenagers.  The important thing is going back to the simple guidelines and etiquette around the use of the online space.  Parents should be involved in their child's online world, as they are very much entitled to be, although I do not know whether many of them realise they have that entitlement.  It is almost like their children are living in the physical world at home at the dinner table but they also live in this online space of which the parents are completely unaware.  I have encountered many cases where I have a mammy telling me she has access to all her son's accounts, but she does not have access to the fake accounts he has set up.  There is a trust and communication piece there between mammy and child.  It is a massive cultural thing in respect of which we are playing catch-up but, by creating awareness, we can catch up.  We are trotting behind our teenagers but the committee can create awareness and it is a very powerful and privileged place to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I will allow other members to come back in.  Ms O'Connor referred to opportunities for younger people to become teachers and that most current teachers may come from a middle-class background.   I presume she was referring to primary and post primary.  That is very concerning because I think everybody should have an opportunity to follow their dream in life, whatever that may be.  I know education can be seen as expensive.  I ask Ms O'Connor to flesh out that point a little.<\/p> <p>  In autumn, the committee will be starting a conversation on leaving certificate reform.  I believe the leaving certificate is totally outdated.  This idea of having to put everything into three hours in June after six years of secondary education is crazy, particularly when one considers the pressure that puts on students.  This has been talked about for years but the talking should stop.  We will definitely be bringing in the witnesses' organisations when we are doing that work on leaving certificate reform.  I ask the witnesses to comment briefly on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#M00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>On the first point, we have to acknowledge that there are access programmes at third level to accommodate people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or those who may be challenged in terms of getting a college place and may find it extremely difficult.  In terms of the current situation with regard to post primary, there are educational values in having a two-year professional master of education, PME, programme but it is extremely costly.  It is quite a journey to go through a four-year degree, followed by a two-year PME.  There is a need to provide an opportunity for trainee teachers undertaking a PME, particularly those in the second year of the course, to earn money.  These are costly programmes and, on top of the cost of the programmes, the students have to be able to support themselves.  We do not want there to be anything that will act as a barrier to good people who want to come into education.  I know access programmes work to a degree but a lot of the opportunity dissipates once one goes into post-graduate education.  A two-year post-graduate course is a significant additional cost, particularly when one is not earning.  We have talked to many students on PME programmes.  Before Covid, they were financing themselves by working part-time jobs in pubs at night or working in shops and everything else.  They could be net contributors to the system when they are in the second year of a PME.<\/p> <p>  I am sure Ms O'Connor will agree that there is a need for greater access to PME programmes because accessing teachers in specific subject areas can be very challenging.  There will have to be consideration of trying to promote diversity in the teaching profession.  Mr. White described the current teacher cohort as predominantly Irish, white and middle class.  I do not have the exact figures in that regard.  It may be worthwhile carrying out a survey on the issue.  There is a need to incentivise people from other cultures and backgrounds to engage in education.  One has to incentivise it and make it attractive for them such that they see it is a profession in which they can have a meaningful career.  When we were dealing with the Ombudsman recently, who has responsibility for human rights, he referred to the idea of a student being able to see his or her image somewhere within the school.  Is the school a mirror reflecting what the students are?  On some occasions, unfortunately, that might not be the case.  We have to consider ways of incentivising participation in teaching.  It may be worth looking creatively at the two-year PME, which is there for good and valid educational reasons, in the context of providing opportunities for people to make some sort of financial living out of it, particularly in the second year of the course.  Those are some of the issues in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As regards the leaving certificate, I could not agree more with the Chairman.  It needs to be reformed.  If the pandemic has shown us anything, it is the fragility of the leaving certificate.  When it was knocked for six last year, we were suddenly left scrambling.  Lessons probably have been learned in the context of this year, with accredited grades and attempt to streamline the exam a little, but there really is a need to consider reforming it.  There should be consideration of the need to semesterise or to have alternative forms of assessment, as well as of how inclusive the assessment models are in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Irwin"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Irwin.

I have been listening to the discussion for the past two hours and have found it riveting.  To pick up on the last point made by Mr. Irwin, I think Mr. White slightly misunderstood my earlier point with regard to patronage.  I know from personal experience that children from different faith backgrounds are more than welcome in all primary schools but I worry that in 90% of primary schools such children do not see themselves reflected at the top of the classroom as a result of the patronage model.  I was struck in a humorous way by some of the earlier advice for parents.  I once told a parent during a parent-teacher meeting that I was far better at dispensing parenting advice before I had children.  That goes a little bit to what the Chairman was talking about.  I am holding back Fortnite in my house but that will not last much longer.<\/p> <p> I have a wider question regarding the influence of social media other than in the cyber-bullying space but going to the issue of young adult mental health and the unrealistic expectations created through social media.  Ms O'Connor referred to mental health services in the south east.  It is worth noting there are no eating disorder beds anywhere in the south east either.  Do those two things feed off each another?  Do bullying and cyber-bullying also feed into that level of unrealistic expectation that our young people are being fed through social media?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060100002#M00500","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I am happy to comment first.  I see daily the impact social media can have, particularly on young girls in the context of body image.  It is a travesty that the only place to treat eating disorders is a private hospital in Dublin.  There is no particular specific help for young people in that regard these days.  I see the impact on young boys in terms of pressure.  In my experience, it is boys spending time online in the evenings, engaged in gaming, and that is the most negative impact of social media.  The interaction between girls can be very negative.  I refer to the exposure to what is the ideal body shape, the ideal body image, eating disorders and self harm.  The incidence of self harm has increased exponentially in schools across the country.   It is a really worrying trend and my fear as a school principal is that we do our best in terms of prevention but, when it comes to intervention, we do not have the supports outside school to back up what we do within schools.  There is a massive gap in supports there.  I refer to the use of social media.  Social media is not the issue - social media is here to stay.  Rather, it is about the use of social media and the responsible use of social media.<\/p><p>I think Mr. White said they have half an hour per week for social, personal and health education, SPHE, on the primary curriculum.  We have one hour.  Within that, we have great programmes, like Be In Ctrll and Lockers.

A huge number of school meals programmes have been rolled out across the country, specifically in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools.  I have no doubt that this is an opportunity to pick up eating disorders among students earlier on.  The company supplies the food and the student gets it.  It is almost up to the teacher to see if there is an issue, and maybe that is unfair.  Maybe this is where it comes back into emotional therapeutic supports.  A teacher could say to the person giving the emotional therapeutic supports that a child in his or her class is not eating, or that they might eat today, but might not eat tomorrow.

If one is in a school with more than 1,000 pupils, it will be much harder to regulate and to keep an eye on everybody in the building.  Supports need to be put in place, particularly for larger schools, where these kinds of issues can manifest themselves in an insidious way in the background.  Very often, schools have a good handle on issues where drugs are involved, and strong substance misuse policies.  Again, it comes back to awareness and getting in early, in first year.

I was a school principal but we were not on the school meals programme before I left to take up this job.  However, if somebody was not eating his or her lunch, a teacher might whisper that to me, as principal.  I might call in that parent and so on.

He visited the D&aacute;il and had a meeting with the committee.<\/p> <p>  Colombia sees Ireland as a partner that is aligned with the multilateralism scenario.  We highly value Ireland's voice at the UN Security Council and the European Union, especially because Ireland understands the challenges and complexities of implementing a peace agreement.  We are working on mutually beneficial economic opportunities, especially considering the need to reactivate our economies affected by Covid-19.  Colombia has been greatly affected in this regard.  We also are working on strengthening ties in education, innovation and science, among others.<\/p> <p>  I must highlight the key role that Irish investment has in Colombia.  It includes companies such Smurfit Kappa, which has been in the country for more than 75 years, and Viva Air Colombia, owned by the Irelandia Aviation group, which is the second largest airline in Colombia.  There are many others which have opened recently in the sustainable energy, infrastructure, forestry, fintech, aviation service and pharma sectors.<\/p> <p>  There is wide room to improve our opportunities.  Visa flexibilisation from Ireland to Colombian citizens will unlock many possibilities to reinforce our people's ties and increase our exchanges in education, trade, investment and tourism.  We hope there could be advances on this matter once the Covid-19 restrictions are reduced.<\/p> <p>  I want to briefly discuss the historic gesture by the Colombian Government regarding the Venezuelan migrant crisis.  The massive exodus of Venezuelan migrants due to a multidimensional crisis in that country is the world's second largest refugee wave only after Syria.  More than 5 million Venezuelans have fled their country in the past five years.  It is unprecedented in Latin America and has regional and even global implications.  Colombia hosts approximately 1.8 million migrants, almost 30% of Venezuelans leaving their country in the past five years.  Last February, the Colombian Government announced the granting of a temporary protection status to Venezuelan migrants including those in irregular status, which comes to nearly 1 million.  This historic step is widely recognised by the international community and organisations, such as the UNHCR, and other agencies.  The status will grant them access to health, work, education and other public services.  This reflects the Colombian Government's commitment to protecting human rights.  We highly welcome the role of the international community through co-operation in this matter.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to peace implementation.<\/p><p>The Government of Colombia is fully committed to the 2016 peace agreement with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, under the peace with legality policy.  My Government has honoured the agreement and the results and measures taken have been recognised in every sphere, including the United Nations Security Council.  The agreement is comprehensive, and covers topics on areas such as rural development, political participation, the end of the conflict, the problem of drugs, victims, implementation and verification.  It is a transversal component of the current national development plan and it is incorporated into the Colombian constitution.  It is estimated that implementation of the agreement will take at least 15 years, and we are in the fifth year of the process.<\/p><p> Ireland's support for the agreement and its implementation is fully recognised by all Colombians.  I express my gratitude for the public support of President Higgins, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish ambassadors in Colombia and New York, the Houses of the Oireachtas, of course, and, in particular, this committee.  We also recognise the role of Eamon Gilmore as the EU representative for the peace process in Colombia.  Furthermore, we highly value the co-operation of the Irish Government in the implementation, through the UN and the EU, of the trust funds for peace and its sharing of lessons derived from its own experiences and challenges regarding the implementation of a peace agreement.  It has taken Ireland more than 23 years to implement the Good Friday Agreement, GFA.  Today, Irish authorities recognise that peace implementation is an ongoing process, especially in difficult areas such as truth, justice and reconciliation.  The voice of the Irish Government regarding the required permanent commitment and recognition of the advances and challenges in the implementation process is of great importance to us.  <\/p><p> I have the honour to be accompanied today by the presidential counsellor for stabilisation and consolidation, Mr. Emilio Jos&eacute; Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa, the highest-ranked officer in charge of overseeing the agreement's implementation.  He will share with the members of the committee the concrete results of the integral implementation of the agreement's focus on the victims, as well in the areas of integration, political participation, victims and gender, territorial development, truth systems, among others, and he will address some of the current challenges.  Counsellor Archila visited Ireland and met with this committee in September 2019 and he has also headed the Colombian Government's delegation in the current national dialogue with the leaders of the recent social mobilisation protests in Colombia.  <\/p><p> As I shared with the committee in my recent updates concerning those protests and the accompanying context, I reiterate that the Colombian Government protects and guarantees the constitutional right of citizens to protest peacefully.  We condemn all types of violence impacting Colombians, without distinction as to its origin, including vandalism and blockades.  I reiterate that my Government has zero tolerance for violations of any human rights and any excessive use of force.  The corresponding authorities are investigating all alleged cases with full autonomy.  We appreciate the support for the call made by President Duque for this meaningful dialogue and encourage the maintenance of a responsible and constructive approach.  I will hand over the floor to Counsellor Archila now.  I am sure we all appreciate him taking the time to address the members of the committee, especially given it is 6.30 a.m. in Colombia.  The counsellor also has a press engagement at 7 a.m. or 7.30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I am very grateful for this invitation to address the committee.  I reaffirm what our ambassador just mentioned regarding the political willingness and commitment of President Ivan Duque to the full implementation of the agreements with the former FARC through our policy of peace with legality.  I reiterate how grateful we are for the co-operation we received from Ireland.  The Irish ambassador in Colombia is a wonderful woman.  I feel very acquainted with her.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, we, the Government of Colombia and President Duque, appreciate the role of Eamon Gilmore, his experience, knowledge and generosity in sharing with us all that experience and knowledge.  We feel Ireland's presence in the Security Council is a key element in the understanding at that level of the complexities involved in the implementation of a peace agreement.  We think it is important to be aware of the magnitude of what has been accomplished and those challenges which remain.  President Duque understands that the agreement was signed not by a government but by the Colombian state.  The agreement was incorporated in our constitution and, therefore, part of the presidential mandate is to implement the agreement in good faith and to do it in accordance with all other political policies.  That is the reason it was so important for us to issue our policy of peace with legality to enable the transparency that will allow Colombians and the international community to be aware of what we aim to accomplish during these first years of the implementation of the agreement.  As the ambassador pointed out, this will be a long-lasting effort.  <\/p> <p>  We have worked on every aspect of the implementation of the agreement and, in each of those elements, we have been committed by President Duque to ensure we take advantage of the 15-year period of implementation.  An opportunity arises for Colombia in that regard, because many of the issues that must be addressed are ones that should have been addressed decades ago, with or without the agreement.  However, those issues require a longer period of work and consistent advancement to enable what is involved to be achieved.  Therefore, in every area of the peace with legality policy, it will be found that we have worked to have long-term planning in place.  In addition, no money appeared when the agreement was signed and, therefore, it is necessary for us as a society to focus our resources so they match with the importance we give to the accomplishment of every aspect of the agreement.  <\/p> <p>  This is true in respect of the political guarantees we have granted to the ex-combatants.  The committee will be aware that in less than four years the Colombian state changed its constitution and Colombians who were participating in violence and fighting other Colombians are now in the congress.<\/p><p>During this period, we granted them security and guarantees so that they could participate in their local elections.  We did that efficiently.  We had the most peaceful local elections in Colombia of the past 60 years.  Many ex-FARC members participated and are now on their local councils as mayors or governors because people voted for them.  We worked on granting the legal guarantees that changed our constitution.  Now, all of the institutions of transitional justice are working, fully financed and producing results.<\/p><p> At the core of our efforts are the victims.  We work in line with what was agreed in the agreement.  It was believed that victim law needed to be renewed so that we would have another ten years to compensate the victims.  This was done after listening to the victims and learning their expectations.  We went to their representatives and took their doubts and expectations to the Congress of Colombia.  Now we have a new law.<\/p><p> We have worked on trying to incorporate the ex-combatants, of whom there are a little more than 13,000.  We have been able to support them.  This was illustrated in our most recent survey of them, which showed that more than 75% viewed their future with optimism.  That is far above the level of optimism in the rest of Colombia and probably far above the level of optimism in Ireland.<\/p><p> We understand that working to stabilise the 170 municipalities that were more affected by violence and poverty is crucial.  Therefore, we have the development programmes with a territorial approach, PDETs.  These are long-term plans with a territorial emphasis grouping the 170 municipalities into 16 subregions.  We have not only produced long-term planning, but we have also focused significant resources compared with the investments that these municipalities received over the past 200 years.  We will leave this planning in place until it reaches the point of providing no returns.<\/p><p> We understand that, for Colombia, coca crops are a severe menace and that drug trafficking is the source of many of our country's problems.  We have not only maintained the voluntary substitution programme that we received, but we have also created another three programmes, allowing us to move a little more than 100,000 families from growing coca to substitute crops.  That is 400,000 Colombians who are no longer involved in an illegal business that produces so much violence and pain.<\/p><p> We have addressed the chapter on rural development and rural reform through productive factors, infrastructure, social development and the environment.  We have done all of this with an emphasis on the cross-cutting issues of women, gender and ethnicity.  We have been able to implement the most ambitious and successful demining programme.  We have addressed every aspect, implemented long-term planning and produced results.<\/p><p> Regarding reincorporation, we have been able to take 98% of ex-combatants into the health system and 98% of ex-combatants are within the financial system.  They are in our national pension system.  If we count how many of them are involved in a productive project that has been implemented or in are long-term jobs, it amounts to more than 50%.  More than 85% of them have attended the type of education that meets their expectations.  We have included additional guarantees in respect of, for example, housing.  Housing was not foreseen in the agreements, but President Duque understands that we need to work on their housing.  We have delivered housing solutions to many of them and we have a plan to ensure that the 13,000 are covered.<\/p><p> Regarding the PDETs for the 170 municipalities that were more affected by violence and poverty, we are investing approximately 5 billion Colombian pesos in those municipalities.  This is ten times the budget of the National Roads Institute, INV&Iacute;AS, the entity that provides for arterial roads in Colombia.  We have supported the transitional jurisdiction by not only not interfering with its work, but by providing the financial support it needed.  In line with that, this committee will be aware that we approached the UN Security Council and asked that the UN accompany Colombia in overseeing the completion of the sentences that should start being awarded this year to people who were involved in that violence.<\/p><p> I am glad to be attending this meeting, although I am sorry that it is not in person.  I enjoyed my visit to Ireland and I would prefer to be there for this meeting.  I hope that a visit can be arranged in the near future.  If there are specific questions, I will be more than glad to answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Emilio Jos&eacute; Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Archila for his attendance and for indicating his willingness to remain for the duration of our meeting and to take observations and questions from members.

I want to home in on three areas in respect of which I have specific questions for both witnesses.  They relate to the ongoing protests urgently taking place across Colombia, human rights in general and the peace protest.  We saw major mobilisations commence on 28 April right across Colombia.  That was initially to reject the proposed tax reforms that ordinary Colombians would have said disproportionately increased living costs for the lower and middle classes.  The protests also focused on long-running demands in response to increasing poverty, corruption, the murder of social activists and the failed implementation of the peace process.  Since the commencement of the national strike we have seen gross violations of human rights, arbitrary murders and killings of protestors.  Video evidence has been widely circulated on social media showing that the police are guilty.  I have seen it as have many other people, including those in human rights organisations.  It shows the shooting of live ammunition and the firing of gas canisters at people&rsquo;s faces right into their eyes.  That is a practice borrowed from Chile.  We have seen where there have been arbitrary arrests, sexual assaults and young people committing suicide as a result of sexual assaults being perpetrated on them by state players.  We have also seen many videos of people being shot at by people wearing civilian clothes and these are protesters.  In one incident we have seen several men exit from a truck and open fire at civilians, protestors, and later police IDs and jackets were found in that vehicle.  It has been widely established by human rights organisations such as Temblores that between 28 April and 21 May it is estimated there have been more than 2,900 cases of police abuse, more than 43 apparent killings by state forces and 39 reported cases of eye injuries mainly as a direct result of the purposeful firing of gas canisters into protestors&rsquo; eyes.  There have been more than 1,200 arbitrary arrests and more than 21 cases of sexual assault.  Also, worryingly, there have been reports of hundreds of protestors who have gone missing, having been taken into police custody and whose whereabouts is unknown.  There is considerable video evidence online of people who had been taken into police custody having been summarily executed and their bodies having been dumped in rivers by state forces, which is concerning.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make some specific points regarding that.  Only last week the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Michelle Bachelet, asked for an independent investigation into what is happening in Colombia regarding the state crack down on protestors.  Will Colombia support an independent investigation into what is happening there?  I listened intently to what the ambassador said.  She did not explicitly condemn any human rights abuses against the protestors, including the killings and firing of projectiles into people&rsquo;s faces, but she might take the opportunity to do so.  There has been a massive international response to these atrocities.  It is not something that happened without being looked upon in horror by the world, hence the welcome statements from the UN High Commissioner.  Will the details of all the people who have been taken into police be made public?  There is great concern that people who have been taken into police custody have subsequently been found dead on roadsides and in rivers.  It is crucially important that full information is made available on people who have been officially arrested and subsequently released and those who are still missing.<\/p> <p>  I wish to express my solidarity and support for the national strike committee on the need for meaningful negotiations to take place between the Colombian authorities and the committee.  I support the national strike committee's principal demand, namely, to stop all violence.  <\/p> <p>  I wish to focus on the issue of human rights in general.  With the protests commencing earlier this year Colombia has unfortunately been in the international eye for gross human rights violations over many years.  According to the UN verification mission, 133 human rights defenders were killed in 2020, 117 were killed in 2019, 115 were killed in 2018 and 105 were killed in 2017.  Unfortunately, more human rights defenders are being murdered on an annual basis and those figures are growing.  That is a major concern.  There needs to be full engagement with the National Commission on Security Guarantees and participating organisations to ensure the definition and implementation of a public policy to dismantle parliamentary successor groups, which must take place.  I look forward to hearing the response to that.  There is a need for total reform of the police services.  People have called for moving responsibility for the police from the ministry of defence to a civilian department, disbanding the anti-riot force and other measures.  Can the witnesses advise if there will be any reform of the police services within Colombia?<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of the peace process.  Since the commencement of the peace process in Colombian some positive strides have been made but there are areas of serious concern.  The implementation of the peace agreement has been slow in many areas and some opposition politicians in Colombia are concerned about the gross underfunding of the process.  Human rights organisations and opposition politicians suggest a different picture compared to that portrayed by the Colombian authorities and they single out the areas where slowest progress is being made, which are the chapters focused on the root causes of the armed conflict, namely, the rural issue and land reform.  There is also concern about the number of former FARC combatants who have been assassinated to date.  It is estimated more than 270 FARC members have been assassinated since the commencement of the peace process in 2016.  That is deeply concerning.<\/p><p>We need to see the full implementation of peace and renewed efforts by government to bring an end to attacks on former members of FARC and on the peace process in general.  There needs to be maximum protection for former members of FARC and increased attention to the legalisation of land titles, provision of land to peasant farmers and measures to provide former FARC combatants with access to land to facilitate development of socioeconomic projects.<\/p><p> I will touch on the prioritisation of the mutually agreed coca substitution.  I listened intently to the figures given there but more needs to be done in terms of programmes, financial payments, access to alternative economic projects and an end to the forced eradication programmes in communities where manual substitution has been agreed.<\/p><p> There are many points there but, to sum up, I ask about human rights, the protests and the huge concerns around the peace process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#D00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I will revert to the witnesses with a number of wide-ranging questions from Deputy Brady on the current protests, the issues surrounding the negotiations including what is happening and what is likely to happen, the broader issue of the peace process and rule of law and specific issues of land reform and coca growth.

We feel sorrow for people affected by the strike and by protestors who did not behave according to the standards.  We feel sorrow and solidarity for people who have been affected by police or other authorities that have abused their power.  We are committed to the investigation of all affected people.  We feel the same in relation to policemen and public servants that have been attacked.  There is no distinction between our commitment to the investigation and the resolution that those actions that were outside the rule of law need to be investigated.  All people who have acted outside constitutional and legal standards need to be investigated and, if found guilty, punished.<\/p> <p>  We are committed to the highest standards of human rights in the regular life of Colombia and, in particular, in the time of protest.  We are open with all our attitude to co-operate and facilitate the investigation by all the independent authorities in Colombia.  The general attorney's office is an independent branch of the Colombian state, as are the procuradur&iacute;a and the contralor&iacute;a.  They have been accompanying this process and are doing their job in relation to the people affected.  Vice President Marta Luc&iacute;a Ram&iacute;rez was in Washington and Ambassador Cort&eacute;s Ortiz will go into detail on the timing of the visit of the human rights mission.  We added that to the presence of the United Nations representative for human rights.  We agreed to that and have been acting to have those guarantees for the people who are peacefully protesting.  <\/p> <p>  In accordance with President Duque's instructions, we are hearing the voices of the national strike committee and having regional talks in all areas of Colombia with people who are marching and expressing their opinions.  At this moment, we have more than 42 of these dialogues and negotiating processes around the country.  I will meet the national strike committee again in a few hours and we have been more than open to their expectations that we enter a negotiation sphere.  However, we have said that the blockades of our roads need to come to an end.  The blockades of our roads and communication systems have caused a huge amount of sorrow and pain.  They have affected all Colombian people.  They have affected people in the countryside.  They have caused people not to receive medicines and made food and supplies very costly.  They are more costly than they would have been if the tax reform was passed.  There is no provision in our law, Ireland's law or any country's law to permit protestors to decide who goes through the country or decide which products can pass or not.  That has been our demand.<\/p> <p>  It is not only the Government's demand; it is what the people that marched two days ago asked.  There were thousands of people representing millions of Colombians who have been seriously affected by this unlawful practice.  I received a letter yesterday from the union that embraces more than 98% of Colombian entrepreneurs requesting that we do not enter the negotiation phase if these blockades do not come to an end.<\/p><p> In regard to the inquiries on the implementation, I will be glad to provide information.  We have an English version of the report.  I point out that, according to the Kroc Institute, which surveys the advances we have made, it was remarkable what the Duque administration accomplished in the last year, taking into account the restrictions that we have, in particular the pandemic and also the immigrant problem coming from Venezuela.  Notwithstanding those restrictions, there has been no limitation of the resources that were assigned to the implementation of the agreement.<\/p><p> In some of the areas to which Deputy Brady referred, we have had the most significant advances in the multipurpose cadaster project that Columbia has seen.  It is foreseen that we need to have 3 million ha in 15 years for that land bank and we have provided 1 million in less then 35 months.  We need to give title on more or less 1 million ha to people who are in need.  We have presented to the Congress and the special jurisdiction a ruling on these issues, which is something the Colombian people have been expecting for a long period.<\/p><p> We have implemented co-ordination between all the agencies that have responsibility for the safety of Columbians so they focus on the protection of ex-combatants.  That was analysed by the special jurisdiction and after the one year that it studied, of the 35 special measures that we have for their protection, it made a recommendation in regard to two.  It is obviously our goal that no ex-combatants are attacked or killed, and we are working to fully protect them.  It is illustrative that, last year, the number of people who were attacked or killed reduced by 10%.  If we compare this process with other peace processes that have been implemented in Colombia, this is the one with fewer casualties per 100 ex-combatants.  I emphasise that this is not enough and we are working hard to take that figure to zero.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Emilio Jos&eacute; Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Thank you.

As I said, I have had previous meetings with the committee and I have tried to provide contextual information, which I think is important.  I invite Deputy Brady and all of the members to consider the contextual information on the process, not only one side but the whole reality.  Unfortunately, these protests, which have seen more than 10,000 activities and social protests, have been affected by violence.  I do not want to add to what Mr. Archila said, but I invite members to take into account that there has been a lot of vandalism and this violence has heavily affected our policemen.<\/p> <p>  In my recent communications, I shared with the members of the committee the specific words of President Duque, in which he highlights the solidarity with all the victims in Colombia during this protest.  I want to highlight this point, so I will repeat what he said and I have shared it with the committee previously.  President Duque said that we genuinely and wholeheartedly unite with all the victims of violence and express our solidarity with them.  The message is clear.  Colombia must unite to overcome the ravages of the pandemic and reject violent acts and unlawful ways.<\/p> <p>  I have shared with the committee members information on the investigations that are currently ongoing in terms of the public purse, with more than 163 investigations having been opened.  Yesterday, I shared with the committee information on one formal complaint about missing persons dealt with by the Fiscal&iacute;a General, which is our authority.  There is a unit search for some 200 people who are missing but where there is not a formal complaint.  It has already established where they are through that unit search body, given it is not only a fiscal&iacute;a but contains other institutions.<\/p> <p>  It is important that I invite the committee members to keep this in mind.  We understand the role of social media and how media outlets may support democracy.  It is a reality.  However, it is interesting that in supporting democracy and freedom, social media often does not provide the necessary context that needs to be understood when looking at any issue.  It is no different anywhere and I have seen it here in Europe sometimes, although not necessarily in Ireland.  As I share with the committee members information not only on this moment of the protests but what we are doing, it is important to read that part as well.  This is an invitation to all the members.<\/p> <p>  The same probably applies to the implementation.  I remember my first meeting with the committee and we have had virtual meetings, although, unfortunately, we have not always been able to meet personally.  We always share not only what we are doing and the level of engagement and commitment but, when we have this conversation, some of the committee members have mentioned how impressive it is what Colombia has done and how difficult it has been for Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement was signed but it took close to ten years for the arms surrender and there has been another ten years or more since then.  We understand there might be different contexts.  That is why I always highlight that I am happy to be here because the committee members can definitely understand the challenges and understand that it takes a long-term process.  In Colombia, we would all love to see everything done in two, three or five years but what is very clear is the commitment, in particular the commitment of the government.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight the presence of Mr. Archila and say how much we are always committed to sharing information with the committee on where we are.  I will not add much more.  I mention the visit of the current Vice President and Foreign Minister of Colombia, Ms Ram&iacute;rez, to Washington.<\/p><p>She had a very comprehensive visit with members of government, civil society, the US Congress, the US Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, and Samantha Power, who is of Irish origin.  In one of these meetings she met the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, IACHR, and she was very clear in extending an invitation to the IACHR.  At present, the institutions in Colombia, including the prosecutor's office, the attorney general's office and the ombudsman's office, have this on the agenda.  A delegation has already accepted an invitation to Colombia between 8 and 11 June.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Brady, perhaps Colombia is different from many other countries in the region.  I do not know whether he has been in the region but Colombia is a very open country.  It is always open to having this type of transparency and scrutiny.  We also have strong institutions that are working.  This is why I always highlight the constructive approach.  I guess the committee has experience of what it means.<\/p><p> I want to speak more about the pandemic.  It is important to understand the context.  We are very heavily economically affected by the pandemic.  People are tired of lockdowns.  We saw protests here against lockdowns but there was respect and statements in support of the Garda because some protestors had flares and fireworks.  People are tired and we see this in Colombia.  Of course, it can happen in any country of the world.  We are working on this.  Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa took time out of his work to share this with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Not unlike part of my country, emerging from a stage of conflict is never easy.  The old wounds die hard.  As people try to cope with the injustice of the past, there will be many opportunities to fall on the path to full peace and reconciliation.<\/p> <p>  It is not so much that I have questions for the ambassador as I have things I would like her country to do.  My colleague, Deputy Brady, has outlined a number of serious matters of concerns.  It is my belief that when these allegations are made, it is vital that the Colombian Government openly and honestly addresses each issue as it arises.  The investigation of issues that arise from time to time, particularly in the area of human rights abuses and violence, is extremely important.  If the country cannot be certain of an impartial investigation from among its own people, it should bring in international people to investigate human rights abuses or issues where there is some doubt with respect to the violence.<\/p> <p>  We have the Good Friday Agreement and some people would say we have not come an awful long way since the day we signed it.  There are still difficulties and those difficulties will be there for many years to come.  I ask that the public of Columbia be made aware of every instance of abuse or violence, and that they are dealt with openly and honestly in the local communities, as well as satisfying the international press and watchers.<\/p> <p>  I wish Colombia well.  I want to see it emerge and become the type of place the ambassador spoke of, where we would want to holiday and engage on a full-time basis.  It will never be an easy road for Colombia but as it walks this road, the people of Ireland are with it.  As good friends can, we will challenge it from time to time and ask the ambassador to explain issues, such as my colleague, Deputy Brady, has raised this morning.  I thank the ambassador for coming before the committee and ask her to pass on my thanks to Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa who had to leave the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#G00700","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for his questions.  First, I recognise particularly the importance of this session and I will always take the committee's questions very seriously and I am open to share my answers, and in the case I do not have an answer, of course to make sure the Colombian authorities know that.<\/p> <p>  Second, Colombia is a country that has transformed in recent years.  Perhaps Senator Craughwell is looking at one difficult picture at present.  We recognise this but the country is completely changing in how we are recovering and the socioeconomic fabric.<\/p><p>For example, for the past 20 years we have been working hard to fight poverty.  Unfortunately, a week before the strike started there was a report to say that 2.7 million Colombians had gone back into poverty.  This is mostly due to the pandemic, even though the Government has been working at double capacity on health, the ICUs and the programmes for the poorest of the poor but the reality is that we have been heavily affected.<\/p><p> I invite the committee to recognise that Colombia is a country that has already transformed its health.  Before the pandemic, we were the country in Latin America that was growing the most.  We received nearly 6 million tourists and we were really working well but now the Government understands that the young people are asking for more.  There are historical demands, which are fine because we understand that people are in the streets in Colombia and maybe in other countries as well.<\/p><p> That is why, for example, as the national dialogue is going on, the Government of President Duque is already engaging in a specific programme for the youth to provide zero fees to enter third level education and a programme for the poorer young people to access housing, for example.  He just launched a housing and work programme because we understand that we have to engage in this dialogue but we are listening to the concerns of the people.  They are mostly economic concerns but there are many historic concerns.  Unfortunately, in Colombia, like in many Latin American countries, there is inequality but we are not going to solve inequality in one year or in one day.  This is something that is an ongoing process so that is why we are working as hard as we can in this agenda of recovering.<\/p><p> On vaccinations, so far we have 10 million people vaccinated in Colombia.  We are a country of 50 million so we are ten times the population of Ireland but we are working hard on that.  We need full respect for the protests but we must also condemn the violence and I want to reiterate that.<\/p><p> On the investigations, I may have said this already but I want to reiterate that in Colombia there are independent institutions already.  Our attorney general's office is not part of the Government.  It is an independent institution and it is the only institution that really can account for the violations in that process and of course there will be sanctions.  I will give the specific information on the investigations.  The investigations are into the alleged misconduct of policemen.  There are 163 disciplinary investigations open, including: 77 for abuse; 11 for homicide; 31 for battery; 18 for injury; two for sexual harassment; and 24 for misconduct.  The policemen have been very affected.  During the protests, there were people injured.  We are all Colombians.  More than 1,000 civilians and more than 1,000 policemen have been injured.  Two policemen were killed as well.  That is why we are engaged in this dialogue with the complexities that Mr. Archila mentioned.<\/p><p> Perhaps the timing of this debate is good because it is a great opportunity to hear the members.  I have always been open.  I do not know if other ambassadors do this but I have asked for meetings with all of the members and I have met some of those who have responded to my request.  I have permanent contact with Deputy Brady and the Chairman and I will always be open.  As I say, Colombia seeks to provide an example of how open we are to listen to all sides, to talk and to convey the messages we receive because we know how important this dialogue is.  Colombia is a country that is transforming and that will move on.  It has been resilient and the members will be a part of this success story through engaging with us.  Colombia has been a success story.  We have faced many challenges, we are facing this one and we are confident that we will move on with the respect for human rights but also with this conscience of stopping all types of violence, not only one side.<\/p><p> On the implementation, Mr. Archila mentioned that it is a long-term commitment for 50 years.  It is part of our Constitution and it is a long term commitment.  This Government has so much to say about results, which is what one wants in the end.  Many people may want more, even perhaps including the members and that is fine but we have to understand the complexities and the long-term investment and commitment as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#G00800","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It goes without saying but merits repeating that Ireland has been and is a strong supporter of the Colombian peace process and we have given practical expression to that support, as the ambassador will be aware.  We remain strong supporters of the Colombian peace process and as the ambassador has said in reverse, we will remain strong friends of Colombia.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, I share the sentiment that, as friends, it would be unhelpful if we were not open and straight with the ambassador.  I share the deep concerns of colleagues about the human rights situation in Colombia.  I would argue that Colombia cannot achieve the rule of law by extrajudicial methods and that there must be standards in law enforcement, the judicial process and the penal process.  I am heartened to hear the ambassador say that there are approximately 160 individual investigations in process.  That is welcome.  We would be concerned, however, as a country and based on all of our experience, that Colombia has to maintain the peace process through the rule of law.<\/p> <p>  Having made that point, I am at a little disadvantage in that I was in transit in the car during some of the ambassador's presentation.  I was trying to listen to it and to manage to do some city driving as well so I did not pick up on everything the ambassador initially said.  I want to make a further comment that the ambassador's remarks on housing and education were priorities are so crucial.  The way Colombia will achieve a real, profound and lasting peace is by addressing the housing and education question.<\/p> <p>  It is hoped that tourism into Colombia can be restored.  It is crucial economically, socially and in every other way.  I do not have to remind the witnesses that Colombia's tourism product will be greatly improved by a rigorous addressing and upholding of the rule of law, democratic principles and proper judicial principles.<\/p> <p>  I would have missed this point so I ask where Colombia is with the pandemic and where the witnesses see the implications of that for the country.  The ambassador is not in the Executive wing of the Colombian Government but Colombia's new budgetary requirements are arising from the pandemic.  Where is Colombia with vaccinations and caseloads in the context of the pandemic?  Where do the witnesses see that going?  This is an Executive function but it would seem logical that in the achieving of a budgetary situation to deal with the pandemic, the Colombian Government would try to achieve a level of consensus and societal buy-in to its tax methods, which should help to deal with the demonstrations.<\/p><p>We are strong supporters of the Colombian peace process.  We firmly believe in it and want it to succeed.  We want to visit a prosperous and successful Colombia in future.  There is no reason we should not do so.  I wish Colombia well in its endeavours in that direction.  As friends, we have to strongly make the points we made and it would be negligent of us on a number of fronts not to do so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#H00200","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the ambassador and Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa for their time.  They are very welcome and it has been a pleasure to hear from them both.  Their statements about providing a future for the youth of Colombia in terms of work, housing and education are very positive and I welcome them wholeheartedly.<\/p> <p>  On the pausing or pushing back of non-Covid medical care because of the demands Covid placed on the health system and health and medical care for women and children, are there plans to conduct an assessment of the impact of Covid on these services across Colombia?  Has an assessment been carried out?  What are the plans to address this issue?<\/p> <p>  I will address Mr. Archila Pe&ntilde;alosa's statement on the local elections.  In terms of gender equality and female participation in politics, Colombia has done very well at a national level.  I am curious to note that there has not been the same level of progress at a national level.  What was the rate of female participation in local elections in terms of the candidature and gender balance of elected representatives?<\/p> <p>  I refer specifically to an OECD report from 2019 which referred to violence against women candidates and the impact that may have on women seeking a career in politics.  The committee has heard substantial reports from various organisations on how countries can emerge from Covid in terms of the societal and political changes that will be needed.  Globally, we are now in a place where we need to address the pre-existing disadvantages that women experience in terms of educational attainment, business and economic participation, political representation and activism, both at the national and local levels.

When we say Columbia is a democratic country, it is not because it is a label but because we know that democracy is based on values, one of which is human rights.  We fully believe in that.<\/p> <p>  On this issue of international scrutiny and transparency, members may not know that Colombia has had a UN office for human rights since 1996.  There are more than 20 UN agencies in Colombia working on different areas.  I will mot mention other countries by name but not many countries would be comfortable with such a presence or with working with these agencies.  When we talk about investigations and human rights defenders, the UN office in the Colombia works with the fiscal&iacute;a in identifying these cases.  The institutions are independent and we work fully with the UN agencies.  That is why we care so much and are always explaining and listening.  We respect the seriousness of the issues driving the protests and guarantee that mobilisations are free and without stigmatisation.<\/p> <p>  As with all parts of the world, the security forces in Columbia have a role in protecting the rights of citizens.  That is in the constitution and they cannot go further than the constitutional law.  That is clear.<\/p> <p>  Colombia has faced the scourge of the drugs problem.  Let me tell the members something from my heart.  We see huge consumption of drugs in many countries, particularly in Europe.  People cannot imagine the level of violence that is behind the consumption of drugs.  Perhaps members may know this if they go to areas in Dublin such as Ballyfermot.  Behind all of these drugs, there is always violence and the Colombian police have faced that for many years.  The police has strict training in human rights.  Could it be better?  Of course, and it has to be better.<\/p> <p>  The security forces in Colombia have a constitutional responsibility to guarantee the rights of citizens to participate in demonstrations, which they have done.  Their duties and obligations cannot go further than what is in the constitution and in law.  I assure members that is the case.  That is why I give an update on our investigations every two weeks.  The Columbian police force is very legitimate.  We are recognised for co-operating with many countries, including in Africa and Central America, for example, in providing training.  We are at a difficult moment but I assure members that we are working within the law and the constitution.  Any violations that have happened are being investigated and will full sanctions will follow.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the question about Covid.  As I have said, it has had a serious effect.  The first thing the Government of President Duque did was to more than double the capacity of intensive care units, ICUs, and of the health sector in terms of medical doctors.  Colombia is a very diverse territory of over 1 million square kilometres, extending from the Caribbean coast to the Andes Mountains and the Amazon.  Colombia has 32 departments which are equivalent to Irish counties.  In each department, there was a particular supply for ICUs to make sure we had capacity.<\/p> <p>  Colombia has had one of the longest lockdowns.  As a result, many people are tired of the lockdown and the economy has been very heavily affected.  The Government of President Duque made sure no one had to make a horrible decision about who could or could not go into an ICU.  The Government also ensured the health sector could work by providing support.  We were not as generous as Ireland has been with its population but we are providing this support.  That was one of the reasons for the tax reforms.  We are now having fiscal difficulties so we had to make sure we had enough resources.<\/p> <p>  I ask members to bear in mind that Colombia has ten times the population of Ireland.  We have had more than 3 million cases of Covid whereas there have been approximately 260,000 cases in Ireland.  Covid has caused 88,000 deaths in Columbia.  We have started vaccinations.  Colombia is experiencing a peak of Covid and the strikes have taken place during this peak.  Imagine massive protests in Ireland in January this year.  I just give that as an example.  That is why the death rate has increased.<\/p><p>We have been very focused on vaccination and have already vaccinated 10 million people.  We have already started vaccinating people of 40 years and older.  Our population is not as old as it is here, perhaps, but it is important to keep in mind that we are focusing on this.  We are actually vaccinating the teachers because we want to make sure that schools, although open, operate in a flexible way.  There is a focus on students and members of the military.  With regard to those associated with the peace implementation and reintegrated people, all of the people are being enabled to have access to the vaccine and healthcare.  We have been heavily affected, as can be seen from the numbers.  Colombia is now the country with the third highest number of cases.  The is the kind of ranking a country never wants.  We know the reality on the mobilisations but I am not according blame in that regard.  I am just stating the reality.  We are working hard on how to recover the economy, our main focus being on the social programmes.<\/p><p> On the question on youth and problems with education, we are now making sure that we provide subsidies to companies to make sure they hire staff between 18 and 28 years.  On the matter of elections, there is to be an election in November for local, regional and national youth districts.  This is new for us.  It is to give a greater voice to the youth.  This is what we call the pact for youth.  There is a very ambitious programme for housing.  Historically, Colombia has had very solid policies on housing but now, given that many people are on the streets asking for jobs and more opportunities, we have to be mindful that we cannot just achieve an economic recovery in terms of numbers.  It must be in terms of people because this is what we know.  We do not just talk about figures or GDP because we have to make sure we listen to the people.<\/p><p> On the impact of Covid on our health system, there was a health reform I wish to mention.  The strike committee decided to ask the government to take it out and we did.  The reform was to address some of the difficulties.  In the cities, 97% of the people have access to healthcare.  There is a public system and also a private health system.  There are some issues because we have had to invest in more resources over the pandemic to make sure a long journey will be very stable.  We are working on that.  The Colombian Minister of Health and Social Protection is the vice president of the COVAX mechanism.  Our Minister of Foreign Affairs went to Washington, where one of the first points on the agenda was to ask the US Administration to support us better in terms of vaccinations.  Unfortunately, as we see, those who were able to get most of the vaccines got them.  The reality, since we are not all vaccinated, is that it is very difficult to talk about a recovering economy.  We have a solid plan.  With the protests, some of the vaccinations in some areas were affected but we are now on track.<\/p><p> On the question as to whether there is a study on the long-term effect on our health service, we will share what we have with Deputy Clarke.  I am not aware that we have a study.  Maybe there is one but I am not sure of the information.  Knowing the Deputy's interest, I will make sure she gets the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Is the indiscriminate targeting of protestors by the police and other actors a legitimate response to some of the actions of the protestors?  To my mind, it was not a legitimate response.  Could the ambassador comment on that?<\/p> <p>  My second point is on the investigations that have been launched.  While I fully welcome the commencement of investigations, I note that in 2020 and 2019, there have been many deaths at the hands of police forces targeting protestors.  About 13 protestors died at the hands of police as a direct consequence of their direct involvement in protests.  There has been total impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes.  I ask the ambassador to state what sentences have been handed down to the perpetrators of the crimes.  What is being done to ensure there are thorough investigations?  Full, thorough and independent investigations are critical.  <\/p> <p>  On the broader issue, on the end of the systematic use of police violence, I asked a specific question on the reform of the police services within Colombia.

I ask Ms Cort&eacute;s Ortiz to deal with Deputy Brady's points.

There are in the region of 1.8 million, or almost 2 million.  The ambassador might refer to how this has further stretched the Colombian economic response, bearing in mind what she said in response to Deputy Clarke on Covid.  We very much acknowledge in Ireland the complex nature of the current circumstances in Colombia.  As Senator Reilly and others have said, we speak this afternoon in solidarity, notwithstanding the very serious and urgent issues Colombia is facing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#K00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and the Chairman.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the blockades, it is so important to hear from the committee the condemnation of all types of violence on all sides.  The public force has the duty to protect not only the protestors but also all other Colombians.  There have been some dramatic events that I am sure many do not regard as peaceful protests.  There was an attempt to burn alive a group of ten police officers by setting fire to a station.  There was the burning and looting of an hotel in Cali where police officers were staying.  There was an attempted sexual assault of a woman police officer in Cali.  The unfortunate case of Allison has been mentioned.  Protestors have set fire to local criminal courts in Tulu&aacute;.  In those criminal courts, more than 1,000 firearms have been taken by people.<\/p><p>I assure Deputy Brady that those are not legitimate, peaceful protests.  Having pacific protests with the youth talking and singing are good for us and we are listening but the other matters are criminal actions.  Pretending to burn alive a group of ten garda&iacute; is not what we would call a peaceful protest.  That is why in those cases, under the constitution, the police have to intervene, because we cannot just let the country burn itself.  Under the limits of the law and the constitution, there is no doubt that crime gangs have a role in promoting that cause.<\/p><p> While I do not want to go into it, the context that Colombia will have elections a year from now is important.  People in Colombia are saying this and that.  It is important to take into account that there will be both elections to congress and general elections.  There is no doubt that crime gangs are promoting this cause and anything that weakens the Government may be good for those purposes.  I am sure that members agree with me that burning and looting a place is not a pacific protest.  This is unfortunate.  We have seen the reality with civilians.  I reiterate not only that we express solidarity, but also that we want to move on from that with our institutions and the right investigations, listening to the people.  That this is what we are doing.  Most of the reasons are economic.<\/p><p> In 2019, we had protests in the region.  There was a long protest in Chile as well.  Thirteen people died.  There are currently five sentences from the attorney general.  I can send further information about the type of sentences.  We have been working on that.  Regarding investigations, while I have not yet mentioned it, according to the attorney general's office, 17 civilians associated with the protest have been killed during the protest and two police officers have been killed and we are investigating that.<\/p><p> I want to clarify that there is no systemic abuse by police.  We have police who have to act under the constitution.  This is what we are doing, with all the limits, scrutiny and transparency.  Criminals have taken more than 1,000 firearms from the criminal courts and Fiscal&iacute;a.  The authorities have to be there.  That does not mean that we are not having a dialogue but these are criminal activities.  The blockades have been bad.  I mentioned to members of Sinn F&eacute;in last week that two babies died in an ambulance because of a blockade.  That is terrible for us.  One baby who was supposed to go to a hospital could not get to a hospital because there was a blockade and then died in an ambulance.  Imagine being the mother.  That is why, as recently as last weekend, there was a protest called a silent protest.  Millions of Colombians went on to the main streets of the main cities in Colombia, supporting the role of the police and calling for the end of violence and the end of blockades.  This is the type of information that I invite the committee to have.<\/p><p> The police are part of the ministry of defence in Colombia.  I remember that the director of the national police mentioned that police themselves presented reforms that I understand are in congress.  We have a congress like Ireland has the Oireachtas.  Those discussions have to be in the congress.  Those reforms cannot be through killing policemen or trying to burn them alive.  I appreciate the committee's solidarity with the situation.<\/p><p> I appreciate the Chairman's question and want to move from the historic gesture of Colombia.  In this context, we are implementing a peace agreement and moving forward.  Of course we are facing a protest.  No country in Europe has done what Colombia is doing, receiving 1.8 million migrants and having refugees really integrate.  The Irish Government has supported some efforts.  A particular NGO called GOAL is working on that.  I invite the committee to look at that.  Colombia is an example with regard not only to solidarity but also to respect for human rights.  It is a significant challenge for us.  How to have solidarity with Venezuelans is a significant challenge for us.  In the last five years, we have tried all measures to facilitate refugees.  Colombia has a border of more than 2,000 km with Venezuela.  Nearly 1 million Venezuelans have had access to healthcare in the Colombian system.  Imagine the strain on our resources from that.  That is why we wanted to avoid the abuse of migrants' human rights and why we are trying to reintegrate people.  Just the process of identification costs us more than $35 million.<\/p><p> That is why we say we are progressive.  We have challenges, as all countries have challenges.  We have institutions which are working.  We are confident, as President Duque has said, that this opportunity to listen to the people and the youth will make us more resilient and make sure that we move on.  Human rights and respect for law are so important for any country.  We need to make sure that we are a stable democracy.  Nobody wants to see an unstable country.  Venezuela is already unstable with no democracy but a dictatorship.  Colombia wants to be clear about democracy and human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021060100002#K00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The focus of my opening statement is on the questions that have arisen in regard to the constitutional future of our shared island in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  I am the secretary of Ireland's Future.  Our organisation was established to advocate for and promote debate and discussion about Ireland's future, including the possibility and viability of new constitutional arrangements on the island.  We are guided by the values of the Good Friday Agreement and are dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights and equality and fostering mutual respect between all views and traditions that share our island.  Ireland's Future considers that any move to new constitutional arrangements requires serious thought, consideration and planning.  We believe the requisite planning for these potential changes must be broad, inclusive, detailed and comprehensive.  Constitutional change must be, or can only be, on the basis of consent of citizens of the island of Ireland, as informed by the Good Friday Agreement, and I have forwarded a copy of our mission statement, outlining our values and objectives, for members' consideration.<\/p><p> I would like to give an overview of some events and activity which we have been engaged in with Ireland's Future.  Prior to the event of the pandemic, we had organised a series of conferences and town hall meetings, all of which were exceptionally well attended to give expression to the ongoing societal conversation in relation to constitutional change.  Our Beyond Brexit - the Future of Ireland conference was organised in consultation with the then Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was addressed by the leaders of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Green Party in the North, the deputy leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Dara Calleary, and the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh.  The event was attended by more than 2,000 people.  There was a very stressful couple of weeks in the run up to it.  We did not know how well attended that might be but were overawed by those in attendance and the mutual sense that swept through that hall that day.  That was followed in 2019 by well-attended events in Newry and also in Croke Park which were addressed by, among others, High Court, Mr. Justice Richard Humphreys and Professor Seamus McGuinness of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  I have included copies of the event literature for the committee's collective attention.<\/p><p> Our events were complimented by public letters to the Taoiseach appealing to the Irish Government in the first instance to consider the position of Irish citizens in the North in the context of what was then an emerging rights vacuum, then latterly with regard to the then deepening Brexit crisis.  Ours has been an evolutionary experience, I should add, addressing concerns at they occurred at that moment in time.  Our most recent letter, in November 2019, urged the Government to convene an all-island citizen's assembly as a forum to enable discussion on future constitutional change.<\/p><p> That letter of November 2019 was signed by 1,000 prominent Irish citizens two thirds of whom were resident in the South and also by many citizens of the Irish diaspora.  Prominent signatories included actors Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea, film director Jim Sheridan, the mayor of Boston and now US Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh, writer Eoin Colfer, poets Paula Meehan and Theo Dorgan, musicians Christy Moore, Aoife Scott and Sharon Shannon, economist David McWilliams and commentators Fintan O&rsquo;Toole and Martina Devlin as well as our own Frances Black, whom we are proud to have as chairperson of our organisation.  I should say \"our\" in the greater collective because Senator Black is obviously a member of this committee.  All of our public correspondence are included in the event literature, for the Waterfront, our event in Newry and Croke Park and they can be reviewed at the members' convenience.<\/p><p> With the event of the pandemic, our activism was required to go online as Zoom became our new normal.  Indeed, this has permitted us to increase our reach and to deepen the meaningful conversations that are ongoing.  The calibre of contributors that we have been able to attract, aligned with the breadth of viewer participation, has been remarkable.<\/p><p> The standing, range and influence of people involved with Ireland's Future and the vast reach that we benefit from is evident from our most recent series of podcasts, which I have included in my submission.  They have attracted exceptional viewerships for both live and post views of these webcasts and addressed, among other issues, in May 2020, the implications of the pandemic for health provision across the island and the consideration of an all-island health service, which was Dr. Ilona Duffy, Professor Gabriel Scally and Professor Jim Dornan, who, regrettably, has since passed away.  I would like to take this public moment to express our sympathy with the late Professor Dornan's family.<\/p><p> Later, in May 2020, we held a webcast on the economic recovery beyond Covid and considered an all-island economy.  That webcast was addressed by the economist David McWilliams as well as economist, author and adviser to the SDLP at Stormont, Paul Gosling, and Patricia McKeown, a trade unionist from Unison.  In June 2020, we held a webcast on Brexit and the Irish Protocol which was addressed by our own Brian Feeney, Tony Connelly, the renowned expert from RT&Eacute;, and Owen Reidy.<\/p><p> In October 2020, we held A Vision for Ireland - the next generation of Irish voices, which was an exceptionally vibrant and future-thinking webcast whereby all of the participants were under 30, and included Senator Eileen Flynn, Laura Harmon who, I think, was having technical difficulties and I hope has been able to join us, Conal &Oacute; Corra, a language activist, Neil McManus, a county hurler for Antrim and Denise Chaila, the rapper and performance artist from Limerick.  In December 2020, our own Martina Devlin held an online interview with Congressman Richie Neal, chair of the influential US House Committee on Ways and Means.<\/p><p> Most recently, in February 2021, we held A New Ireland &ndash; Warm House for All.  That was, I am proud to say, was our most successful webcast.  It has attracted more than 40,000 viewers across all platforms.  It was unique in so far as all of the participants were from a traditionally unionist background.  Belfast born, award winning television and radio broadcaster Andrea Catherwood chaired the conversations with Mark Langhammer, a trade unionist-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622502000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Other participants included Denzil McDaniel, the former editor of the <i>Impartial Reporter<\/i>in Fermanagh based in Enniskillen, Reverend Karen Sethuraman, a Baptist minister from east Belfast, Glenn Bradley, a former British soldier from the Shankill Road, and Trevor Lunn MLA, formerly of the Alliance Party.  This was a significant event as it gave evidence of an ever-widening range of people who are contributing to the conversation about Ireland's Future.  New voices are speaking up.  They are from all backgrounds and they are asking questions and joining us in the conversation about the future of Ireland.  We are delighted and proud that Trevor Lunn MLA has since formally joined the research and publication sub-committee of Ireland's Future.  Indeed, last week Reverend Sethuraman also formally joined Ireland's Future.  I am so privileged and proud that people of such talent have joined our organisation.  Obviously, the committee will be familiar with their contributions have heard their evidence recently.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's Future appeals to everyone, but particularly to the Government in Dublin, to listen attentively to this conversation and to begin planning and preparing for constitutional change.  We accept that we have taken a public position on this sensitive topic and to do so, we feel that we have to put our indepth thoughts and analysis on the record.<br\/><br\/>Insofar as that is concerned, we have conducted our own research, are in the process of conducting more research and have produced literature by way of publications setting out the deliberate steps that require to be taken to effect constitutional change in a responsible, legal fashion consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.  I have attached with the literature to this opening statement our three published research documents to date: Principled Framework for Change, published in November last, which was followed up by Advancing the Conversation, The Way Forward, in January 2021, and, most recently, Planning for a Strong Economy in a New Ireland, which was published on 25 March.

Such an assembly would be rigorously impartial from external political influence.  It will commission its own research, reports, and economic modelling.  It is a well-worn constitutional path.<\/p><p>Members will all be familiar with its benefits.  This path has already led to successive civic movements and has been decisive in securing positive outcomes for progressive changes through referendums.<\/p><p> The civic assembly is a forum in which political issues would be discussed by its membership and, ultimately, voted upon.  Typically, it would be made up of citizens selected at random but could also include a number of elected politicians.  It should hear expert evidence and produce recommendations.  In addressing the models of reunification it would serve to counter some of the mythology and fears that surround Irish reunification, namely, the block grant, issues around healthcare provision, taxation and education standards.<\/p><p> The civic assembly could be set up to allow a government to entrust the people with setting the direction on a controversial subject, for example.  The result is then one that can be kept at arm's length or embraced depending on the political temperature of the day.<\/p><p> The most notable recent example is the constitutional convention of 2012 to 2014 and the Citizens' Assembly of 2016.  The convention recommended the extension of the presidential voting franchise and received wide support in the Oireachtas but the matter has yet to be put to the electorate for approval.  I am sure we will return to this topic in our discussion.  The Citizens' Assembly sat for 18 months.  Among other things, it recommended the repeal of the eighth amendment's prohibition on abortion in the State.<\/p><p> With regard to what a citizens' assembly on Irish reunification might look like, if a citizens' assembly were to consider proposals for Irish reunification, it should and could include political representatives and citizens from both jurisdictions on the island and possibly Britain.  Non-participation by elected unionist politicians has been flagged but should not prevent it taking place.  The conversations of this committee are illustrative of that fact.<\/p><p> Constitutional change is already upon these islands; Brexit is constitutional change.  The only responsible course of action for the Irish Government is to undertake what it reasonably can to prepare for the next stage of Irish self-determination, whatever choice that may be.  I assert again that it this would not be a preconditioned citizens' assembly but a genuine organ that we must listen to.<\/p><p> A citizens' assembly would also consider what constitutional amendments would be necessary to the Irish Constitution to ensure continued adherence to the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  It would be an opportunity to examine the competing models of reunification on the basis of reliable information and data.  It should, in particular, consider the responsibilities on the Irish State to adhere to the obligations of the sovereign power in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> With regard to practical arrangements, in the Republic, the citizens' assembly would be set up by a resolution of the Oireachtas and be funded by the Department of Finance.  Its terms of reference would be set out in that resolution.  It would have no formal role to require or even recommend constitutional or legislative change in the Republic but would command considerable political importance.  The Irish Government would be required to respond to its suggestions and it is our view that this is a project that must be initiated by the Irish Government.  The possibility of a joint Irish-British constitutional convention modelling reunification is unlikely.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the event of Brexit has changed everything forever.  The constitutional security of the North, as part of the United Kingdom, has been thrust into terminal decline by Brexit.  Brexit was not something that anybody in Ireland, North or South, proposed, argued for or wanted.  A border poll is the constitutional pathway back to the EU for all citizens resident in this island to reset the democratic deficit that Brexit represents.  The Good Friday Agreement, which was overwhelmingly mandated by the people of Ireland on both sides of the Border, provides an inbuilt democratic and legislative pathway out of this madness with a Border poll.<\/p><p> The debate is happening.  It has been acknowledged by the former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, among other senior members of the Judiciary.  It is a conversation that is happening in staffrooms, coffee shops, school car parks when people drop their children at school and at the side of football pitches up and down the country.  This debate needs to be informed by rationality and planning because it cannot be characterised by the recklessness, ill-preparedness and arrogance of the Brexit debate.  The Irish Government, the European Union and the United States Administration need to begin planning for what I consider to be the inevitable.  A reminder of this is to be found in the growing number of initiatives that are producing useful research output, much of which accords with our established positions and supports our efforts or assists our thinking.  The preparations are now well under way and gathering pace.<\/p><p> We note the valuable work being undertaken by the analysing and researching Ireland North and South project, ARINS, a collaboration between the Royal Irish Academy and the Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies at Notre Dame's Keough School of Global Affairs.  This work includes, for example, an excellent contribution by Dr. Adele Bergin and Professor Seamus McGuinness on living standards and quality of life on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> The shared island unit and the ESRI have launched a significant new research programmes which will explore areas such as health and education on the island.  We also note with interest that the University College London's working group on unification referendums has essentially followed our lead in calling for extensive advance planning and preparation.  The report notes that the years of acrimony over Brexit highlights the real dangers of calling for a vote without adequate advance planning.<\/p><p> If the Good Friday Agreement really does underpin new relationships, no one needs to be anxious about this invitation to a conversation about how we share our island in the future.  A border poll is wholly consistent with the vision laid out in the Good Friday Agreement.  Our island is on a path towards concurrent referendums on whether people would prefer a united Ireland, and thus EU membership, or wish to retain the union with Britain.  It is the fundamental outworking of democracy.  This is acknowledged within the internal constitutional legal orders of both states, underpinned by international law, and recognition is implied by the EU in its endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  Making use of the arrangements to test the principle of consent or the right to self-determination at the appropriate time and with proper preparation should provoke no one.  Planning has commenced and the Governments must catch up.<\/p><p> I am more than happy to attempt to address any questions, queries or concerns that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Niall Murphy agus roimh a r&aacute;iteas tosaigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#C00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for allowing me to contribute first.  Unfortunately, I must leave around 10.40 a.m. to attend a meeting of another committee of which I am Chair.  I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation.  It is difficult to speak on one's own and not have the support of Ms Harmon.  It is a pity we lost her due to technology problems.<\/p> <p>  I work with Ireland's Future and Mr. Murphy and love the vital work that they do.  The group represents civil society whose voice needs to be heard.  I will never forget my first time in Belfast when I attended the Beyond Brexit event.  It was unbelievable.  The energy I felt in the room that day and the fears felt by people about what was going to happen with Brexit rang a bell for me.  Ireland's Future developed from that event, which was held on the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  There were many speakers, including the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I will never forget the panel of speakers who spoke on that day.  One of the panel, a man from the unionist community, said that nobody had contacted him to have a conversation about what new constitutional change would look like.  He was, he said, open to that conversation.<\/p> <p>  I remember another occasion when I visited Belfast as a member of the committee on Brexit.  As members who were on that committee will remember, we met various people, including representatives of cross-community groups and the farming community, who expressed concern about the impact of Brexit on their business.<\/p><p>There was so much fear from people regarding Brexit.  Ireland's Future plays an important role in that regard.<\/p><p> I want to thank Mr. Murphy for attending.  I have one or two questions I want to ask him.

It is a privilege to have Senator Black as our chairperson.  I am cognisant of how busy she is and of how attentive she is to her role in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  Taking matters one by one, the shared island unit is something that we welcome.  It is convincing, we collaborate with its work and we are obliged to be one of the official consultees, specifically when the shared island dialogues are convened.  We have been asked to contribute and we have contributed speakers to each shared island dialogue which has occurred.  We have undertaken consultation with and offered advice and opinion to the civil servants within the shared island unit.  However, more needs to be done by the Irish Government.  The unit is welcome and it seems to be well resourced, albeit some of the finance has been recycled from previous commitments.  Insofar as its work is important, we do not consider that it is consistent with where the conversation is in real terms.  Real evidence-led research to inform more concrete planning needs to be undertaken but it is welcome as a first step and we wholly embrace the opportunity to work with it.<\/p> <p>  This committee has an important role in setting the agenda and in holding the different mechanisms of the Good Friday Agreement to account.  In my day job, I work as a solicitor in Belfast and I have enjoyed the opportunity to engage with the various academic research models that have been ongoing.  I most thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to work with Professor Colin Harvey at Queen's University Belfast and have observed the rulings in the High Court in Belfast regarding Raymond McCord's application for judicial review.<\/p> <p>  I understand and appreciate the law relating to schedule 1 of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is important to understand and communicate that whereas the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may call a border poll at any time, he or she must call a border poll if it appears likely that a majority would: \"express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.\"  I would respectfully submit that the threshold of evidence for that has already been reached in terms of electoral results.  The Northern jurisdiction returns 18 MPs to Westminster and the majority of those represent a united Ireland constituency.  When it comes to city and county councils in the North, there are four councils which would broadly have a united Ireland perspective and four which would broadly have a United Kingdom perspective.  Belfast City Council, the largest council in the North, would genuinely have a neutral constitutional preference but one which we would consider leans more towards reunification.  Electoral results would inform us that the evidence threshold has been met for the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to discharge his obligation under schedule 1 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.<\/p> <p>  On what this committee could do, whereas we consider that the evidence threshold has been met, we want to know what evidence the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is judging.  It would appear that he is not using what should be the most fundamental parameter in a democracy, namely, electoral results.  Therefore, what is he using?  There are difficulties with polls.  When a poll is broadly in line with one's thinking, it is to be welcomed.  When it is not, then one contests its reliability.  We respectfully consider that this committee could usefully correspond with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to ask him what evidence he is using to discharge his obligations under schedule 1 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.<\/p> <p>  The evidence sessions that this committee has been engaged in have been very productive and insightful and I trust they have been beneficial to its members.  It might be time that this committee considered producing its own report on the prospect of constitutional change on our island during this decade.  There has been great benefit from the five evidence sessions that have been convened so the committee may consider appointing a rapporteur to pull together its published opinion on the topic.  I would urge the committee to write to the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to publish his response, if and when received, and to comment on and debate how it considers the efficacy and the constitutional politeness of his response.  The committee should consider if the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is taking the issue seriously or if lip service is being paid to what is a fundamental part of our Good Friday Agreement.  Those are two action points which could be sensibly addressed by the committee.<\/p> <p>  I mention the Senator's final point.  She correctly observed that our Warm House For All event was transformative insofar as it provided a neutral, honest and genuine space for voices that perhaps do not often find expression in political unionism to be heard.  As I said in my opening remarks, we are so proud that Trevor Lunn, MLA, and the Reverend Karen Sutherman found it within themselves to consider that our organisation was one they felt they could contribute to and one in which their voices would be honestly cherished, which they are.  We want to continue that work, take it forward and maintain the level of outreach which we have undertaken in good faith to date.  The most organic, natural and responsible place for those conversations to take place is in an all-island citizens' assembly with the space and the subject matter being completely neutralised.  In that way, we can get the gloves on, get down and dirty, get the facts, commission, assess and review the evidence and make recommendations.<\/p><p>I hope I have answered the Senator's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I do not know whether I have any more time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#E00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>For clarity, Senator Black has two and a half minutes left.

It is our firm view, and two of the research publications we have published speak to this, that the full outworking and expression of the Good Friday Agreement resolves itself in the respect for the principle of consent.  It is almost 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement and the principle of consent has not yet been tested.  What would anybody have to fear from getting a barometer on testing the principle of consent?  I have spent my entire life observing the principle of consent.  Generations older than me and younger than me deserve the opportunity to test it.  Within the lawfulness and the constitutionality of a border poll being reflected in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and the Good Friday Agreement with regard to its success, we then must examine the minutiae of all of the systems and how we would meld them and truly become one new unitary state sharing one island, and what this means for a civil service, a police service, a health service or an education service.  I have to say I was very enlightened to read the observations of Deputies Neale Richmond and Jim O'Callaghan in their public essays and lectures to the university in Oxford.  There was some very blue-sky thinking.<\/p> <p>  Discourse is defined by people who are willing to take a public position and seek comment on it.  The most natural constitutional place for this to occur in a democracy and a republic is within a citizens' assembly.  I do not believe we would find time to assess any of these issues in a morning's session in a committee.  They all require the appropriate expertise and data.  It really is only the southern Government that can critically test tax yields, demographic population shifts and where services will be required.  If one were to attempt something as significant as a realignment of constitutional arrangements, all of these things must be very well tested in advance.  We have seen the madness of an ill-prepared and ill-defined question on an unsuspecting public.  We have seen how it convulsed the body politic in Britain.  We must learn from this experience and undertake not to repeat it, which is why we feel our call for work to be done now is critical and appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#E00600","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Our speakers in this round will be Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile, Mickey Brady and Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>When five minutes remain I will tell the speakers.

Mr. Murphy made a compelling presentation on the sheer volume of work that Ireland's Future has been involved in.  The research it has been doing leaves so many others in its wake with regard to the necessary work and the very impressive and positive engagement and outreach it is doing with other communities.  I acknowledge this and it is very important that the committee does so.<\/p> <p>  The volume of work and range of engagement is reflective of the discourse and debate that is live in our society.  In many ways, the Oireachtas and the Irish Government in bringing together a citizens' assembly would need to catch up with this discourse and the debate out there already.  Recently, we took a positive step when the Seanad agreed an amendment to call on the Irish Government to establish a citizens' assembly.  I want to get Mr. Murphy's views on the political and symbolic importance of this and where it rests in the broader discourse.<\/p> <p>  Much of this relates to aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the various grounds.  Within this context, unilateral decisions can be taken and moves can be taken by the Irish Government, one of which would be the convening of a citizens' assembly, and a range of others that are non-threatening and would in no way undermine the structures of the Good Friday Agreement.  They would be entirely in keeping with constitutional and other political obligations.<\/p> <p>  What are the views of Mr. Murphy on a call for the Irish Government to hold a referendum on extending presidential voting rights to citizens outside the State, obviously to include those of us who are Irish in the North?  The Government tells us that in the course of the pandemic it is unable to hold a referendum, and we all accept this given the restrictions placed upon us.  It is a necessary and required obligation the Government needs to fulfil.  Is this something on which Ireland's Future will engage with the Irish Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#E00900","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has raised several issues and I will address them one by one.  The recent motion that included the amendment was exceptionally welcome and was perhaps the first time the concept of a citizens' assembly was publicly validated by a political motion.  I am wholly cognisant of the fact there is an element of symbolism to this but it must be noted it is indicative of a political reality and responsive to the growing momentum.  There is a wider, deeper and more engaged conversation going on with regard to our collective future.<\/p> <p>  There is more that can be done.  The Irish Government, in our respectful analysis, should publish a Green Paper on Irish unity that identifies steps and measures to inform a successful transition to a single island unitary state.  There should be an Oireachtas joint committee on Irish reunification with the task of outlining, driving, monitoring and reviewing the transition towards Irish unity.  We had hoped the incumbent Taoiseach might have appointed a dedicated Minister of State with specific responsibility for developing strategies to advance Irish unity.<\/p><p>The South Korean Administration has a Ministry dedicated to the potential for reunification.  Scotland established a constitutional unit within government to do this.  The opportunities and challenges for Scottish independence were previously outlined in a 670 page document called Scotland's Future.  People sometimes wonder where we got our name.  That outlined the Scottish Government's vision of how Scotland could and would transition towards independence.  That was in 2013.  It set out the implications of independence across monetary, fiscal, industrial and social policy and set out its position with regard to constitutional issues and defence policy.  There are explicit nuts and bolts that need to be considered in the discharge of this issue.  Whereas the motion was obviously welcome, it should be considered as a starting point to a long line of governmental work which needs to be undertaken.<\/p><p> With regard to presidential voting rights, I recall attending the launch of Votes for Irish Citizens Abroad, VICA, in EPIC.  I was inspired by the ambition and the articulate nature of the advocates who wanted to take on responsibility for being the persuasive voice for that referendum.  That referendum will happen and I am confident that it will pass.  I do not note any political party in the South that objects to it and all of us have family all over the world.<\/p><p> My father is from Blackwatertown on the border of Armagh and Tyrone.  I see Michelle Gildernew, who will understand the tension between Armagh and Tyrone.  He was the youngest of 12 and all of his older brothers and sisters had to emigrate, so I have as many cousins in America as I do in England, and more than I have in Ireland.  They are proud of their Irish heritage and would welcome the opportunity to be engaged in the election of our next President.  I am personally aware of the necessity of Covid restrictions.  I spent 17 days on a ventilator last March and April.  I almost died on 30 March.  I absolutely understand and will always respect the need to be cautious but that does not inhibit the preparation for that referendum.  We are hopefully emerging from the worst days of this pandemic.  Brighter days are literally and metaphorically ahead of us.  Now is a responsible time to begin to undertake the preparation for that referendum, which I hope, trust and expect should pass with gusto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his comprehensive presentation.

We have a series of ongoing confidential conversations that we have undertaken, which will remain confidential, with a view to building confidence, increasing levels of understanding, and dismantling some fears and myths which are honestly and genuinely held.  It is a positive opportunity to do that, which we embrace.  There are many misconceptions about what a new nation might look like but there is also an opportunity in those conversations to provide assurance that there will be an honest and genuine respect for the British identity in a new Ireland.  We have to recall and appreciate the political reality that that will be a substantive constituency in a new political arrangement and that that, in and of itself, means that their own voice may be significant in the mechanics of the electoral cycles.<\/p> <p>  I will not attempt to speak for unionism other than to say that I will publicly observe that unionism and unionist people are noble.  They are my friends, neighbours and work colleagues.  I do not want any new constitutional dispensation to be one where there is any sense that they feel that their citizenship is being eroded, much less denied, or that their identity is not cherished.  We need to work with those important concepts to understand and appreciate what their concerns are.  Whereas we will undertake and continue to undertake public and confidential conversations, the most natural and appropriate place for those concerns to be articulated is in an all-island citizens' assembly.  Political unionism will grapple with the potential for a constitutional change.  That difficulty needs to be respected and given as much understanding and latitude as possible.<\/p> <p>  Changes have happened and are happening on our island.  Brexit has changed everything forever.  Constitutional change is already upon these islands by virtue of Brexit.  Our democratic expression was ignored, which is a grave difficulty that we have had to endure on this island.  We need to work together to make sure that all voices and identities are genuinely heard.  I emphasise the word \"genuinely\".  It cannot be lip service.  I would not want to encourage the inception of any new constitutional arrangement where anybody felt that their identity was lessened, cheapened or not afforded appropriate respect because that is an experience that I have lived.  It is a lived experience for people of an Irish identity in the North.  I would oppose that as strenuously in a post-reunification scenario as I promote the enrichment of our own culture at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I will ask questions quickly and Mr. Murphy might answer them as he goes.<\/p><p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his ongoing work and Senator Frances Black as well.

I have often travelled to America wearing different hats in my professional work.  There is a genuine and in-depth understanding and defensive self-pride in the role that America has played in its foreign policy.  This assuredness really stood up for the Good Friday Agreement at a sensitive time during Brexit.  That is why we took the view it was important to conduct the interview with Congressman Richard Neal, who is chairman of the ways and means committee.  It was not the then US President, Mr. Trump, who would sign the trade deal with post Brexit Britain but the ways and means committee.  The committee made it crystal clear, as did Ms Nancy Pelosi, Congressman Brendan Boyle and Mr. Marty Walsh, that if one hair on the head of the Good Friday Agreement was ruffled, there would be no trade deal.

They seem to have done considerable work in the recent years.  I find the conversation interesting because we are on a similar pathway but we seem to have different concepts of how we get there.  We have agreement that unionist and Protestant communities on either side of the Border and their rights and British identity need to be respected and enshrined in any future arrangement.  Where we part ways is how we get to a conclusion.  I want to delve into that element of it.  Please do not shoot the messenger but there is a train of thought that Ireland's Future is aligned to Sinn F&eacute;in.  That view is not only held by unionists.  That is also a view held down south and it is important that Ireland's Future addresses that.  There is a fear in unionism.  This train of thought is feared in unionism circles.  I would like to know the response of the Ireland's Future representatives to that.<\/p> <p>  The work up to the Good Friday Agreement was crucial.  There is no way that the agreement could have been established and pulled together under the terms of the citizens' assembly.  The work behind the scenes was vast and went on for years.  An extraordinary volume of work was done by many people behind the scenes to build trust in unionism.  We seem to forget that unionist parties came to the table and agreed to the make-up of the Good Friday Agreement.  They agreed to what was in the agreement.  They agreed on the constitutional wherewithal for a referendum.<\/p> <p>  We have this idea that we need to drive on with the citizens' assembly, that it represents everyone, that we will have a border poll and all will be rosy.  That is where I separate from Ireland's Future because we have a great deal of work to do to build trust in Northern Ireland.  We cannot afford to have a border poll without gaining that trust.  That is achievable.  We have one shot at doing this right.  I do not disagree on the question of a citizens' assembly but I believe the work being done at the moment by the shared island unit, as presented to us two weeks ago, is over and above what a citizens' assembly would do.  Currently, the unit is reaching out to more than 130 community groups.  I would like organisations such as Ireland's Future that represent nationalist views to take on and do more of what the shared island unit is doing by going into unionist and loyalist communities or to consider going into loyalist heartlands and have these conversations with the people there.  They should bring in speakers from those backgrounds.  Ireland's Future could do tremendous work by taking that approach.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Murphy's colleague, Colin Harvey, came in.  I was critical of him when he presented an EU paper because it was not an EU paper and he had not consulted widely with unionists.  Mr. Murphy and Professor Harvey could do critical work.

In recent months, we have seen Irish citizenship being made a mockery of, with citizens born on this island being told that while they might think they are Irish, they are not and are actually British.

We have seen victims of our conflict treated with contempt by the British Government when it tore up the Stormont House Agreement.

It is surely the case that there is nothing more legitimate in working towards a shared future than the work being done by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Murphy not recognise that an incredible amount of research is being conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, to scope how we can converge as an island in areas such as healthcare, education, an all-island economy, foreign direct investment, FDI, and services?  The NESC is doing research, with the title \"Digging Deeper, into how we can work together, considering public policy on the environment and social and economic issues.  The groundwork is being done but I feel it is consistently being downgraded and not being recognised.<\/p> <p>  I am from the Cooley Mountains and this is my world.  All my life, I have dreamt that we will get to a point where the Department of the Taoiseach would be creating and developing documents on how we work properly on a shared island and towards a future united Ireland.  In that context, does Ireland's Future recognise that more than 400 people have already engaged in an all-Ireland conversation on policy?  Legitimate and well regarded non-political researchers are working towards creating policies on how we can converge as one island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#H00700","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

Mr. Murphy just said that the organisation had now adopted a position.  Did it take it long to come to that position?  It seems to have been a little rushed if the group was originally just a neutral forum.  Suddenly, it is not a neutral forum but a lobby group for a united Ireland and a border poll.

I hear people talking about playing catch-up and the need for the thinking of one side to catch up with the thinking of the other.  That is not helpful language.  It presumes that there is a right and a wrong.  That is not what we are all trying to do.  What we are trying to do here is to build consensus and agreement.  Senator Blaney made a very good point about the work that went into the Good Friday Agreement that was about building consensus and relationships.  That is what the focus should be.

I will go ahead with my questions on Ms Harmon's statement, which Mr. Murphy read out.  What is his view on the citizens' assembly?  Should it include politicians or only ordinary citizens?  Both were mentioned.  Previous citizens' assemblies in Ireland, on repeal and marriage equality, were made up of ordinary citizens.  Is that better than including politicians in them?  What is Mr. Murphy's view on that?<\/p> <p>On funding, what type and amount of funding would need to be set aside to make a citizens' assembly meaningful and to get a bang for our buck?  What type of finance do we need to put behind it?  In terms of the practical arrangements, points a) to e) in the opening statement provided by Ireland's Future refer to how it must be a project led and initiated by the Irish Government.  That is fair enough because the possibility of a joint Irish-British constitutional convention modelling reunification is unlikely.  What will be the make-up of this citizens' assembly?  Will it just be a bunch of people from the Republic of Ireland discussing the issues?  How do we get engagement from the Northern Ireland institutions?  If they are not willing to engage, do we just go ahead with a South-Republic of Ireland-centred citizens' assembly?  Can we get more detail on its make-up and how we would proceed with that?

It is very interesting and important to listen to all the contributions.  I challenge the witnesses on what I see as some contradictions between the different statements in their contribution.  I read Ireland's Future economic paper and I respect what is in it but as elected representatives on this committee, we also had the opportunity to listen to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which presented quite different conclusions.  We have to acknowledge the different perspectives and analyses of these points.  Ireland's Future's mission statement, included as part of their statement today, is about advocacy and promoting debate and discussion about Ireland's future, but it also commits to a position.  This has been acknowledged, which is fair enough.  To be clear, whether Ireland's Future is a debate group or is a campaign group is important in the presentation.<\/p><p>I have a concern about tone, in Ms Harmon's provided statement in particular.  Her statement, delivered by Mr. Murphy, described an arrogance about the Brexit debate and yet the group's paper presents a border poll as inevitable.  I find the tone of those statements contradictory because, of course, while change is inevitable over time, setting the outcome at the outset is not necessarily the solution.  A border poll is not necessarily the mechanism for change.  Change will come through thoughtful, creative, citizen-led conversations about all aspects of life.  A border poll may be one outcome from that but there may be others.  I have a difficulty with setting the outcome at the outset. <\/p><p>On the citizens' assembly, University College Dublin, UCD, is doing quite interesting work on how dialogues can be structured and citizens' assemblies are one model of that.  I believe the issues in this are too complex for a single citizens' assembly.  I was involved in previous citizens' assemblies but they were on very net points of constitutional change and very neat issues.  This is much broader and, indeed, the constitutional point is very much a neat point, notwithstanding the complexity of it.  It does not reflect anything like the cultural conversation that necessarily needs to happen.  The work UCD does on this, in conjunction with the shared island initiative, will be very interesting.<\/p><p>I will raise an issue not directly related to Ireland's Future but I would like to get Mr. Murphy's perspective on it.  The new Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, leader, Doug Beattie, wrote a really good article, published in yesterday's<i><\/i>edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  One paragraph really stuck out for me and I ask for the witnesses' perspective on it.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere are no column inches with me criticising either the SDLP or Sinn F&eacute;in for not taking part in the planning discussion around how to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland.  I can understand [this] position, yet I find myself facing criticism because I won&rsquo;t join a discussion about how a united Ireland can be achieved.  Surely people can see that this is an unreasonable ask, and a degree of understanding, as I have shown, stops unnecessary division.  <\/blockquote> <p>It was a really fair point and I would love to get the witnesses' perspective on it, considering they are engaged with a broad group of people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#K00300","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I will take the last comment first.  That is a fair comment by Doug Beattie.  I do not think he, or anybody, would be able to point a finger at any column inches generated by our organisation criticising him for his reticence to become involved in a conversation on constitutional change.  I understand and respect that position.  I touched upon it in my earlier remarks.<\/p> <p>  The fundamental issue is that a citizens' assembly might afford, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill said, the sensitive, thoughtful, citizen-led conversation that would permit the space around which difficult party-political concepts might be addressed.  The referendum to repeal the eighth amendment posed political difficulties for all parties.  The matter was somewhat devolved, almost, and became a-party political.  Through that, the true accurate voice was found and the Constitution was thereby amended.  It is really that spirit we feel might assist in assessing the true thoughts, fears, concerns and ambitions of those who repose a British identity in the North.  As such, the conversation that would occur in a citizens' assembly, informed by the evidence, might provide the political space where compromise can occur. <\/p> <p>  I absolutely do not recognise the contention that we are involved in a conversation with a preordained outcome.  Such an outcome would mean there would be referendums that would pass.  I have no idea whether a border poll would be voted for on either side of the Border.  However, the event of a referendum is, in itself, a demonstration of democracy.  There may be an misapprehension regarding Ireland's Future but the first line of our mission states that we aspire to Irish reunification.  For the avoidance of doubt, we hold the position that we absolutely aspire to a single-island unitary state but we want to facilitate a discussion towards that end.  Again, as reflected on our mission statement, this is in line with the principles and processes as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  We have been as clear as we possibly can be regarding our position, but a better understanding is needed of what has already been democratically mandated on both sides of the Border, that is, the Good Friday Agreement, which is given its legislative expression in the North by the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  That was part of what was mandated on both sides of the Border.<\/p><p>It is a logical, legislative and constitutional outworking of the Good Friday Agreement that consideration be given to a poll - a referendum - on the constitutional status of the island.  Therefore, it is not divisive to speak about that which has already been democratically mandated.

We are entitled to have views and to express them; that is why we are here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#L01000","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Yes, but there is no preordained outcome to a referendum.

I am aware that other people will be contributing, so I will keep my comments fairly brief.  I thank Mr. Murphy for coming before the committee.  It has been a really interesting discussion.  Clearly, there are many views regarding tone and pace even among the members of the committee.  Before I ask two genuinely-meant questions, I want to pull up Mr. Murphy on two things.  A bit like Senator Currie said, I refer to the language about &quot;catching up&quot; - and I can understand where it comes from - that feels a little reflective of the Brexit conversation, where people were ranked by their speed, purity and longevity in adherence to that cause.<br\/><br\/>From the perspective of the SDLP, the North-South aspect and fulfilling all the potential of the Good Friday Agreement is something we have been dedicated to from day one.  If people are, therefore, playing a kind of <i>ma&igrave;tre d'<\/i>role in asking people to come into a process and then being glad that they have decided to join in it, it is important in that context to recognise that the Good Friday Agreement is multifaceted and the border poll is a crucial part of it but that people's work on all the strands and aspects of the agreement also should be respected.  <br\/><br\/>The other brief observation I have as an elected MP is to state that we must be cautious when talking about constituencies.  I think the term &quot;united Ireland constituencies&quot; was used earlier.  I am humble enough to say that I cannot swear to the constitutional aspirations of everybody who voted for me.  Overlaying that outcome on previous election results shows that thousands of people voted for me in the Westminster election of December 2019 who had previously voted for unionist parties.  We campaigned very strongly in that election on the issue of limiting the damage from Brexit.  Therefore, I am just a wee bit cautious, as the SDLP has always been, about people making every election a border poll.  I am also cautious about describing these as &quot;united Ireland constituencies&quot; and ascribing political views to people when they vote on different issues.  <br\/><br\/>I am cautious in that regard concerning not just a diverse constituency like mine but also, for example, in respect of somewhere like Belfast North.  John Finucane MP has expressed similar sentiments to what I just said, in stating that those elections in 2019 were unique and it is important to not immediately bag everybody who voted for remain as being for a united Ireland as well.  Many of those people, including many thousands in my constituency, will be for a united Ireland.  However, I am just uncomfortable for people who voted in good faith on a particular issue, like Brexit, now being put in a basket as part of a &quot;united Ireland constituency&quot; as a result.  I think that kind of presumptuousness frightens people and may not facilitate people voting outside their comfort zones.  <br\/><br\/>I also agreed with a lot of points from different contributions.  I have two queries about engagement with unionism more widely.  It was interesting to hear from Rev. Karen Sethuraman and Mr. Trevor Lunn MLA recently at this committee on the subject of engagement with people who do not come from a traditional nationalist background and who are not instinctively for this conversation.  How far will Ireland's Future go to engage with individuals in that regard, as well as more broadly?  We had a presentation from officials in the shared Ireland unit and they had also done good work in searching and finding people who were not already plugged into this conversation.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding the final report of the University College London, UCL, working group on Irish unification referendums published last week, has Mr. Murphy had an opportunity to go through it?  An interim report was published by the group some months ago.  The final report now considers some of the structural aspects which must be examined to have a good, solid and engaged debate and some of the gates that will need to be passed through.  I would like to hear Mr. Murphy's response to that report.  Has that served to crystalise his thinking regarding the timing of a possible referendum?  Those are my questions, because I know others want to come in.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I will take Dr. Farry now.

I will try to be brief.  I welcome Mr. Murphy to the meeting.  I do not take a position on a united Ireland, as such, or other constitutional matters but I am very happy to engage on Ireland's future and other matters on a without prejudice basis as to where things may go.  I appreciate that a fluid and open conversation is happening in many respects.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Murphy earlier made reference to the Alliance Party vote and the wider centre ground in Northern Ireland.  There is a certain fluidity to that.  It will be influenced not only by the offer in terms of any potential united Ireland but also in terms of the push factors and how the UK and Northern Ireland are perceived, and how Northern Ireland is seen to be working or not.  It is important to bear in mind that constituency of voters will look at practical issues and can move around in terms of potential opinions, subject to a whole range of factors.  Many of the issues of concern about how a united Ireland would look will be practical, rather than symbolic.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise two particular points around process with Mr. Murphy.  I accept that at some point the Governments need to have a proposition.  If there is ever to be a border poll, the proposition would need to be very clear, particularly for those in the centre ground.  That will involve the Irish and UK Governments finessing the question and the detailed proposition that will be put to voters in both jurisdictions on the island.  Before that happens, I understand the need for a citizens' assembly as part of that process, although we are not at that stage just yet.  More work needs to be done around having open-ended conversations.  I would suggest to Mr. Murphy that the best people to do that are in universities, colleges and civil society organisations for now.  If there is a desire to bring in people from a unionist tradition, the more mutual or impartial the forum is perceived to be, the more likely conversations will get going.  If the subject areas are around practical things, such as how the health service would operate in a different situation, that is the type of conversation with which people may be willing to engage, rather than the broader umbrella concept of a united Ireland in general.  That may be a better way of getting people involved in those discussions, particularly on a much broader basis.<\/p> <p>  In a similar light, it is important to try to focus on practical areas of co-operation on a North-South basis.  That might just stand on its own two feet or it may become a precursor to wider political and constitutional change.  There is still ample scope for co-operation between the two jurisdictions on the island.  That needs to be explored much more in the short to medium term anyway, before the wider political and constitutional debate gathers momentum, if that happens, in practice.  I appreciate that we are seeing some very disappointing moves against that from the DUP at the moment but, nonetheless, that is where a lot of focus needs to be in the short term.<\/p> <p>  Those are largely comments but I am happy for Mr. Murphy to respond, including to the questions asked by Ms Hanna.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Covid-19 regulations require us to be out of the room in five minutes.

If it is helpful, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party are entitled to their second round of questions.  If it is in order, would it be possible for us to bring Mr. Murphy in again within a fortnight?  That is as soon as we can get him here.  We would then continue with the rotation, starting with the representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in and followed by the representatives of the Green Party.  That would be appropriate and proper.  I do not know what the rules are about people going north to visit Mr. Murphy but perhaps the different parties could communicate with him separately through Zoom meetings or whatever because teasing out ideas is important to understand everybody's positions and respect them.

I am obliged for the invitation.  I will first deal with Ms Hanna's observations.  I also welcome the initiatives that have been undertaken by the SDLP in convening a forum within the party that seeks to examine, receive and test opinions on the constitutional future.  The new Ireland forum is also an expression of where momentum is at and where the conversation sits.  I look forward to engaging with that forum as part of our ongoing network of output.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hanna also mentioned the working group on unification referendums on the island of Ireland in University College London, UCL, and other universities.  I have not read the full report but received the advance summary.  After an academically robust undertaking, UCL has ostensibly arrived at the same position for which we have been advocating.  Its position on the prospect of a referendum or when it would be held is wholly neutral but it considers a referendum is likely.  It suggests that planning would need to start in good time before any referendum is held and that planning needs to be led by the British and Irish Governments working closely with a full range of actors across the island of Ireland and in Britain.  We agree in that regard.  I have no problem confirming that our analysis is consistent with that of UCL.<\/p> <p>  The university has also noted the acrimony over Brexit and highlights the dangers of calling for a vote without adequate advance planning.  I do not think any person holding a view on Brexit would say the referendum was a well-informed debate on a well set out series of outcomes.  Brexit was haphazard and our lived experience of what went on is a sharp and recent lesson as to how not to do referendums.  I have no qualms in saying that.  We are appealing for planning to commence now insofar as Ireland's future exists.  UCL has done its report.  The Royal Irish Academy's ARINS project is doing work.  The ESRI is doing work, as is the SDLP.  That is what I mean when I say the work has started.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>For the record, I did not ask about that.

As for my position on the UCL, I wholly respect Mr. Farry's observations.  It is a valid perspective.  We have had constructive engagement with the wider Alliance Party, and we have learned from that and hope to continue to do so.  Nevertheless, I am cognisant of recent opinion polls that have examined the constitutional preference of those parties that are constitutionally neutral.  <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>examined the issue on 23 January 2021 and found that 38% of Alliance voters it surveyed leaned towards a united Ireland dispensation, while 26% were of a United Kingdom perspective.  I accept that we cannot repose too much faith in opinion polls, but LucidTalk on behalf of &quot;BBC Spotlight&quot; concluded in April that 77% of Alliance voters incline towards a united Ireland.<br\/><br\/>There are ever-evolving shifts and they are all responsive to the position in which we find ourselves.  We are in a post-Brexit constitutional era.  Insofar as constitutional change is already upon us, Brexit changed our constitutional status.  I am no longer able to avail of the mechanisms of the EU to express a mandate within it.  Unionism reposes a deeply held objection to the Northern Ireland protocol, concerned that it represents constitutional change.  Constitutional change is here already, therefore, and our mission is that we manage it in as responsible and as detailed a manner as possible, and to do so in a form that provides for all perspectives genuinely to contribute and to feel that their constitutional sensibilities are being respected, independent of the outcome.  I do not propose there is a preordained outcome.  The outcome will happen only through the exercise of the franchise and that is what democracy is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021060100002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We will adjourn until Tuesday, 15 June.

I have given a commitment to Deputy Boyd Barrett that I will take another look at the word \"undue\" and I will do that and revert to him, although it is a matter for the Deputy as to how he proposes to proceed with the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 9 and 38, are jointly tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould and amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 85, are jointly tabled by Deputies Boyd Barrett, Gino Kenny, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Barry.  Amendment No. 9 seeks to delete an existing part of section 2 and to substitute it with \"to ensure delivery of vibrant and sustainable mixed income communities\".  That is what we want and what the agency will do.  It is inherent in the Bill as drafted that fundamentally we want the Land Development Agency, LDA, to deliver sustainable communities for people, particularly in the areas of affordable and social housing.  We have already had that discussion already, so I do not propose to rehash that argument.  <\/p> <p>  As currently drafted section 2(c) provides that one of the purposes of the Act is to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social background.  Section 2(n) provides that the purpose of the Act is to facilitate measures designed to achieve socially integrated housing.  It is important to say that rather than picking out one element of the purposes of the Act - I have given a commitment to take another look at the phrase \"undue segregation\" because I can see how that could be construed as what we do not want it to mean - members need to look at all of the purposes listed from section 2(a) to section 2(s).  They should not be seeking to have one of them deleted or to highlight a particular line.  They need to be read in context and together.  Section 2(a) provides that the purposes of the Act is to enable urgent measures to be taken to increase supply of housing in the State and in particular affordable and social housing.  I imagine everyone would agree with that.  Section 2(b) reads \"to ensure that public land which is not being utilised or is under-utilised, is made available for housing in the State.\"  That is just example of the purposes of the Act.  All of the main purposes are listed in subsections (a) to (s).  I am opposing this amendment as I believe what is sought is already adequately covered by the two provisions I referenced, that is, section 2(c) and 2(n).  <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 10 seeks to delete the word \"undue\" and amendment No. 11 seeks to replace the words \"social background\" with \"incomes\".   I get that argument and I have undertaken to take another look at amendment No. 10.  However, I will be opposing it on Committee Stage but I give a commitment to members that I will look at that piece again.  These amendments do not change the intent of the provision, which is to ensure that this legislation seeks to provide and promote greater integration in housing across all of society.  Again, we all want to do that.  As I said, I will be opposing these amendments.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 seek to amend the section by removing any reference to socially integrated housing and replacing with either \"make public housing available to people on a broad range of incomes\" or \"vibrant, sustainable and mixed income communities\".  There is nothing wrong with that wording but we have to ensure that the wording in this Bill when enacted is consistent with other related Acts.  I understand where the Deputies are coming from.  My contention is that these areas are already adequately covered in the context of the purposes of the Act.  Again, I am opposing these amendments as I do not consider they add anything to the provision, which is to provide that this legislation facilitates measures designed to achieve exactly what we all want, that is, socially integrated housing. <\/p> <p>  All of us recognise the importance of greater integration in housing.  As Minister, I want to see the delivery of mixed tenure and affordable housing on State lands, as, I am sure, do all members of the committee.  I said last week, when we met on a number of occasions, that the predominance of the sites, in particular in our urban areas, would be 100% social and affordable, which is an issue we will come to as to move to later sections in the Bill.  It is vital that the State uses its land to provide affordable homes for purchase and rent, as well as social homes.  We need to use all means at our disposal to do that.  <\/p> <p>  I will come back on Report Stage in regard to the wording \"undue segregation\".  I take the point raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 86 in the name of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan seeks to amend section 13(1)(g) by including a reference to communities.  Section 2(d) in regard to the purposes of the Act refers to the development of communities.  This is a sensible amendment.  I am prepared to accept amendment No. 83 to add \"and communities\", which will take into account Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment.   I will make that change further down in section 2(d).  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#A00500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>The wording of legislation is very important.

The issue is also that we have <i>de facto<\/i>segregation by virtue of the fact that the income thresholds for social housing have not increased for more than ten years.  Bit by bit, the people who qualify for social housing are people on ever lower incomes.  These are working people - the bus driver, the nurse, the bank clerk and so on - whose incomes used to qualify them for social housing but no longer do.  They will continue to be moved into a different category unless we significantly increase the income thresholds.<\/p><p>I do not know how many times I raised this with Eoghan Murphy in the last Government.  We were told of a mythical review of the income thresholds.  Every few months we would be told it was coming but it never came.  To me that was a deliberate policy to cull numbers on the social housing lists.  People were literally thrown off the lists.  Whenever a person got the slightest pay increase, he or she was thrown off the list.  This was a source of great distress for people who had been on those lists often for ten or 15 years.  All that time waiting was simply gone.  They have been in limbo since then because there was no affordable scheme in reality and no cost rental scheme in reality.<\/p><p>My point is we are now saying that we need a different category for that group of people.  We end up with <i>de facto<\/i>segregation.  I believe that is why the drafters of the Bill referred to the word &quot;undue&quot;.  They knew in fact there will be segregation in the way we are doing things.  We are going to have different categories of affordable or social housing delivered to different people based on certain thresholds.  I believe we should be looking for ways to genuinely get rid of that segregation by saying that social housing and affordable housing should be available for everyone.<\/p><p>I wish to make one last point.  We see this in reality and it is not unfair to call it housing apartheid.  I know of developments in my area where the 10% social housing is all segregated into one block of a development.  Even different finishings and different quality building materials are used for the social housing parts, which is disgraceful.  In the same development a building that may look externally the same has different finishings internally and different features because it is social housing.  It is as if they are doing it on the cheap.  In most cases such dwellings are segregated from the private ones.  It makes something of a lie of the notion of the somewhat patronising term &quot;social mix&quot;.  If that is what we actually want, if we want a mix of people with different incomes and backgrounds, then it really should be a mix.  It should not be segregated into one block.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#B00700","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I think the Minister misunderstands or misinterprets the significance of the wording change.  The problem is that the idea of mixed tenure automatically promoting integration has become something of a dogma, especially in political circles around housing.  Many of us could take the Minister to mixed tenure housing estates where there is no integration.  Where there are multi-unit developments there will be social housing tenants who are denied the right to participate in the owner management company annual general meetings.  This creates clear divisions.  There are different service delivery arrangements for refuse collection.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, there are different finishes.  There is a practice with apartment developments of putting all the social housing in one block because it is more cost effective for the approved housing body to manage one block rather than a different layout.  It creates all manner of tensions.<\/p> <p>  All the evidence from all our housing policy experts, especially Michelle Norris, Tony Fahey and Mick Byrne in UCD, shows that mixed tenure is not the issue, but mixed income is.  We can achieve mixed income either through mixed tenure or in a variety of other ways.  For example, St. Michael's Estate is an important housing development that Dublin City Council is leading on and the Department is supporting.  That will not be a mixed tenure estate.  It will have social and affordable renters, all of whom will be renters from Dublin City Council.  The great value of that development is that it is mixed income.  That is why I am proposing the amendment.

I have said to members that they should read the purposes of the Act section in its entirety because each of the points in it are related.  In many instances what is being proposed by the speakers would perpetrate segregation by insisting on mono-tenure or purely public housing on public land.  We cannot have it both ways.  We need a mix of affordable purchase.<\/p> <p>  I agree completely on the design point.  It should not be a question of a different design or an apportionment of an area when we state that the area is designated for social or affordable housing.  Deputy O'Callaghan's party and Deputy &Oacute; Broin's party voted against a scheme in Donabate for 1,200 homes.  All the homes are pepper-potted within it, and rightly so.  There is no difference between any of the homes.  Areas of the estates are not picked.<\/p> <p>  I fully understand the phrase \"undue segregation\" and where it is in legislative terms.  It appears in other planning Acts as well.  I have said I will look at that.  I certainly do not want segregation in housing and I would not stand over it.  That is what this legislation ensures.  The aim is that State agency land is available to all people.  That is what it does.  It does not say that there has to be an estate purely for social housing.  In itself, that would perpetrate segregation by having a whole estate set aside as a social housing estate.  We should all want to move away from that.<\/p> <p>  I have explained already and I have no wish to keep going back and forth.  I respect the fact that Deputies have gone to the trouble of tabling amendments.  I will not be accepting them but I will come back on Report Stage with regard to the phrase mentioned, \"undue segregation\".  In fairness, there may be a misunderstanding of what we would actually do within this.  It would be perpetrating segregation of one part of our community from another part of our community.<\/p><p>We would simply be saying that State and public land can only be for a certain type of housing.

Unfortunately, like so many other areas, Irish governments have been slow to catch up on this.<\/p> <p>  Traditionally, transportation was the preserve of engineers, the people who built roads, whereas increasingly it is about active mobility.  For me, the important bit of this amendment is the reference to active mobility because that is much more than the engineering of roads infrastructure, although we need an adequate supply of that.  It also involves, exactly as the Minister said, mobility transport and planning experts to ensure the maximum possible number of options are available if we are to shift people's modal use away from cars and towards other uses.<\/p><p>From my reading of the Bill, it does not seem to mention active mobility anywhere, which is a real omission.  My fear is that, if it is not included, it will not get done.  It will become an option rather than a requirement.  Given that the Minister has said he hopes to see the Land Development Agency incorporate these new active mobility and updated transport policies - and we would ultimately like to see all new housing developments do likewise - I can see no reason the Minister would not accept this amendment or why he would not insert such a provision elsewhere in the Bill if he feels there is a more important location for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#D01700","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>To follow on from that point, in his reply, the Minister said that he felt the amendment is too prescriptive.

We need to acknowledge that, at least in the constituency I share with the Minister, an awful lot of the LDA land banks are on the fringes of towns, away from train stations, traditional town centres and schools that already exist.  The promotion of active travel needs to be at the core of transport and housing policy rather than something outside it, falling into the very broad definition included in the original Bill.

I am a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, under whose remit active mobility falls.

I made many points earlier on about what a land development agency should be.  It should not be a body that essentially opens the door and gives access to the public land bank to private capital.  Rather, it should go in exactly the opposite direction.  It should be a body that takes over the building land bank currently controlled by private speculators and developers in order to use it to deliver housing to meet housing needs, particularly the need for social and affordable housing.  What I would like to see, and what these amendments aim to bring about, is an agency that essentially does what the Kenny report talked about.  It should, in an aggressive way, take control of the bank of land for building that is currently largely privately held in order to deal with outrageous site costs and the hoarding of land and empty properties.  This would be an agency which takes over land and property so that it cannot be hoarded or used for speculation and which would force that land and property into use with the social objective of delivering the housing that people need.

As Deputy Boyd Barrett is aware, the State is the biggest hoarder of land and we need to make sure it uses its land productively for the good of citizens and society.  The Bill is not legislating for privately owned land.  There is already a vacant site levy in place, which I do have an issue with, by the way, and which is there to activate private and public lands.  I am considering and will consider further measures, as appropriate, for private land activation.  I intend to do that because I do not think the vacant site levy operates as it should.  I do not believe it is otherwise appropriate to include such references in this legislation.<\/p><p> We need to get the agency up and running to develop the lands it has already, that is, the nine sites, and to get on with them.  It will have the ability under compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers to acquire other lands, and ransom strips in particular.  Section 2(p) of the Bill already provides for the establishment of appropriate mechanisms and structures for the development of public and privately owned lands for housing.  This will generally operate by consent.  I foresee that happening where the LDA will be partnering with others regarding adjacent private lands.  I have included now appropriate CPO powers to acquire certain private lands where necessary, powers which it did not have in the first draft heads of Bill that we went through in the previous Oireachtas.  I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for tabling the amendment but I will not be accepting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#E01100","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I have made the point, so I will not labour it.  It just shows a fundamental difference in approach.  There is a lot of unutilised public land but, in my opinion and that of many members of the committee, that land is underutilised because central government has refused to give local authorities the money, resources and so on to develop public land.  Rather than seeing the problem being addressed by allowing private finance in on public land, the problem would be addressed by the Government giving the resources and money to local authorities to build public and affordable housing on public land.<\/p> <p>  I take the point about semi-State land and so on and that it is something the agency could usefully do but, again, I think it should be transferred to local authorities.  The big gap and problem is that property developers and land speculators and so on control too much of the land bank.  They manipulate the market and land prices and so on and they drip-feed housing according to what makes the most money for them.  They are fundamentally not interested in solving the housing crisis and, for the most part, they actually benefit from the housing crisis and from keeping suitable building land as a scarce resource that they control.  That is what needs to be addressed and what this agency should be doing, but it is obvious that is not what the Government wants to do because it is dancing very significantly to the tune of the speculators and big property developers.

It is about what the best delivery or development model is for housing on the lands that the LDA will be delivering.  The problem with this set of sections of the Bill is that it promotes joint ventures, land initiatives, collaborations with investment vehicles and a variety of commercial contracts, with the consequence that it will dramatically increase the development costs, not just for any portion of houses on a development that are sold at unaffordable, open market prices, but even for the delivery of affordable homes.  To take an example, Shanganagh Castle is a development that most of us broadly support the principle of because it is 100% public housing.  The difficulty is that the Land Development Agency currently cannot say what the price of the affordable purchase homes will be, because the development and financing model that it will use, which is fundamentally different from the &Oacute; Cualann model which most members of this committee actively support, means that the all-in development costs are higher.  It could be as high as we saw at the O'Devaney Gardens site where so-called affordable homes accessing the serviced sites fund will be sold for as much as &euro;310,000, plus a shared equity portion of another &euro;50,000, so an all-in cost of &euro;360,000.  That is the consequence of developing through joint ventures and land initiatives, which the sections I am trying to amend here facilitate.<\/p> <p>  The Minister rightly mentioned the Donabate development.  A problem with that initiative is that 60% of the homes will not be available to between 80% and 90% of the population, going by the income distribution figures of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, because according to Fingal County Council, they would sell at prices of between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000.  Instead of providing housing for the 80% or 90% of the population currently locked out of the market, we will see, through a joint venture land initiative, 60% of the homes made available to only 15% or 20% of the population, people who already have new homes to purchase because that is all that the market is delivering at the moment.  The Minister knows that I am not in favour of a centralised State agency.  Other Opposition parties have argued for centralised State agencies, although different from the Land Development Agency.  If one is to have one, it makes no sense to use a variety of private sector delivery models that push up prices either for so-called affordable housing or for unaffordable open market homes.  Every single home on public land should be available to the largest number of people, 80% or 90% of the population.  The Government has no business setting up an agency that will allow scarce public land to be used to build homes that will be sold at prices of &euro;400,000 or more.  That is not just bad housing but is reckless in the extreme and is one of the reasons we have a housing crisis in the first place.  That is why amendments Nos. 39, 88, 89, 90 and 93 seek to exclude those speculative private sector delivery mechanisms.  That would clear the way for using delivery mechanisms that guarantee the maximum number of affordable homes at prices that working people can actually afford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#G03200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I wish to move amendments Nos. 39 and 90, and Deputy Pringle asked me to move amendment No. 93 in his name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#G03300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":478,"content":"<p>To clarify, is the Deputy allowed to move an amendment on behalf of another member who is not present?

The latter means that fewer people can access housing that is affordable for either rent or purchase and that obviously locks them out in terms of affordability.  It also creates a housing supply issue because if we rely on the private delivery of housing and private developers, they will develop land - and this is not just in Ireland but anywhere - at a pace at which they can achieve the kinds of full market prices they are looking for.  That means a drip feed of development over time.  For example, one of the largest developers in the country, to which the lands in Donabate have been effectively sold, has enough land for 17,000 homes, according to the developer itself, and, according to that same developer, will build just 1,200 this year.  Therefore, when it comes to land banks, yes, there is an issue with State lands, but there are also issues with private developers, how they hold land and how that fits the market prices they try to achieve.  As for the Land Development Agency, it is very important that we try not only to break that method of delivery at full market price and the slow delivery that goes with it but also to ensure a faster delivery of affordable homes.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 93, which is in the name of Deputy Pringle but which he has asked me to move, relates specifically to investment funds and seeks that the Land Development Agency not be permitted to allow private investment funds purchase land, developments or housing from the agency.  That is a very important amendment and I am happy to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#H01200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":490,"content":"<p>This is part of a series of amendments explained by Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and &Oacute; Broin which seek to exclude what the Bill seeks to include, which is essentially to bring in private investors to develop the public land bank.  This is a point I have made to the Minister before, and Deputy O'Callaghan has just made it too.  I would love to hear the Minister's response on this.  To me, it is not even an ideological comment; it is just a basic statement of fact about a private business.  The private developer has no interest, objectively speaking, in solving the housing crisis - none.  That is not what it is in business for.  That is what the Government is in business for.  That is what the local authorities are in business for.  That is what not-for-profit housing associations and co-operatives are for.  Private investors have one sole purpose and that is to make money.  They do not do anything that does not make them a profit.  If it is not profitable for them to increase supply, on either public land or private land, they just will not do it.  If you needed a lesson in this, you could not get a bigger one than the 2008 crash.  At the point at which the cannot make money, private investors are quite capable of crashing an entire economy because they have no interest in building.  The idea, therefore, that these people who are interested only in money would not only control the private land bank but also then have significant influence over whether public land gets developed for the public and affordable housing we need is, to my mind, tantamount to madness.  I would honestly like to hear the Minister's response.  Does he not remember how the public private partnerships, PPPs, that had been set up with certain developers in this country collapsed because the private developers just decided, \"This is no longer a good deal for me so I am just not doing it\".  Plans to develop part of the north inner city just collapsed because the private developers had no interest.  This Bill gives the public land bank over as a sort of hostage to private investors and private developers, who, let us be clear, and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has alluded to this point, have no interest in the price of housing or rents dramatically decreasing.  We do.  Renters do.  Ordinary workers looking to buy have a big interest in having rents or house prices they can afford.  Private investors have no interest in that.  The last thing they want is for rents or house prices to drop dramatically.  It is madness.<\/p> <p>  Finally, as soon as these PPPs, for want of another term - that is what they are - come into play in one form or another, then accountability and all sorts of secret commercial sensitivity issues come into play such that it is impossible to get to the bottom even of how things are financed and so on.  Rather than all that, we are trying to say that while these private interests borrow money, the State can borrow money too.  It can tax in order to increase the revenue, but it is more effective and less hostage to market forces for the State to do this itself and, of course, in the long run it will save the State money because we will not be leasing property off these guys further down the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#H01300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett and the other Deputies for tabling these amendments.  To put all this in context, the Government is the biggest builder and the biggest investor in housing in the State.  We passed the largest housing budget in the history of the State in budget 2021, bringing forward affordability measures that I hope Deputies opposite will support when the relevant Bill comes before the D&aacute;il because those are real measures and this is the most comprehensive and significant affordable housing Bill ever.<\/p> <p>  We also believe in home ownership, however, and I will tell the Deputies one thing that excludes people.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about excluding people just as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan talked about locking people out.  The greatest mechanism for doing that is to object continually to schemes that have been brought forward by local authorities for real homes for real people that they need.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis, as everyone knows, and I know everyone is earnest in trying to bring about its resolution.  Fundamentally, however, we will not resolve a housing crisis with the public sector on its own.  We will need the private sector.  That is the reality of the matter.  Fundamentally, the Land Development Agency is about putting our State lands to active use.  As all members of the committee will be aware, there are far too many State lands lying idle which have been idle for years and have been subject to back-and-forth discussion and debate on ideological grounds.  Our people want to see delivery.  I reiterate that I envisage we will have 100% social and affordable housing on many of the sites in our urban areas.  Will this require us partnering in some areas?  Absolutely it will.  There is no question about that.  There are nine sites the Land Development Agency has at the moment and I want to see the agency develop them out.  That is the importance of passing this Bill.<\/p><p>There is no silver bullet to the housing crisis.  I put it to the committee that if some members are arguing that it is possible to tackle the housing crisis with one arm tied one's back then that is nonsense.  It cannot be done.  We need to tool up the State.  I am very aware of that.  That is why I have been to the fore in getting our local authorities building again.  What the LDA will be doing will be in addition to what the local authorities are doing.  The purpose of the LDA is to supplement the delivery of housing by local authorities, not to supplant them.  I am opposing these amendments as these provisions are needed to ensure that all avenues can be used to ensure delivery of much-needed housing in the State.  <\/p><p> We need to be delivering 33,000 homes per annum.  We are way off that at the moment.  The continued procrastination and blocking of measures that the Government is trying to bring forward will not help anyone.  It certainly will not help working people to be able to own or rent a home at an affordable rate.  We are trying to meet that need.  These provisions are necessary and are wholly appropriate for the LDA.  It is being established on a commercial basis and, in line with other commercial States bodies, will be able to enter into commercial arrangements.  It needs to be able to do that.  The main Opposition spokesperson has already said in previous hearings that the LDA should not be involved in building homes.  It is also appropriate that the LDA in its role as a development agency would work with other public and private sector land holders, as it is with our local authorities, to develop large areas for the provision of housing and the regeneration of communities.  These provisions are appropriate and I remind Deputies that the LDA will remain in the ownership of the State, with the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform as the shareholders.  There is no provision for any other shareholders.  In addition, all dividends will be returned for the benefit of the Exchequer.  Ministerial consent will be required where the LDA seeks to establish subsidiaries or to enter into significant capital commitments.  This will ensure that there will be a significant oversight of the LDA's operations, including its commercial activities.  There is also provision for ministerial direction to the LDA in relation to its strategic priorities.  <\/p><p> On amendment No. 93 in the name of Deputy Pringle, I am opposing this amendment as I propose to bring in an amendment No. 134 to section 55, which will effectively do the same thing.  This is about the disposal of land by the agency.  Section 55 already provides that ministerial consent is required where the LDA or a subsidiary designated activity company, DAC, is seeking to dispose of land but that this consent is not required where it is disposing of a single house for rent or purchase.  I am bringing an amendment to provide that the LDA will need to seek ministerial approval where more than one house is being sold as part of a linked transaction.  In other words, it will not be able to dispose of more than one house to a single purchaser without seeking ministerial consent.  On the question of why ministerial consent would in some instances be required, there may be occasions where it would be appropriate for the LDA to sell multiple units to a local authority or an approved housing body.  I will bring forward that amendment.  <\/p><p> The planning legislation that I am bringing forward, in respect of which a circular has issued already, prohibits the sale of more than one property in new planning applications to a single purchaser.  There are exceptions to that with which I believe all Deputies are in agreement, that is, approved housing bodies and local authorities for which it would be appropriate in some instances, but that would require ministerial approval under the LDA Bill.  As I said, I will bring forward another amendment, amendment No. 134, to address what Deputy Pringle is getting at in amendment No. 93.  For that reason, I will not be accepting his amendment.  I also will not be accepting the amendments tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould, Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#H01400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I call Deputy &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#J00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  The Minister is factually incorrect in claiming that the Government is the largest builder in the State.  Last year, fewer than 800 new social houses were directly delivered by the local authorities and a couple of hundred houses were delivered by approved housing bodies.  Almost all other housing was purchased from the private sector as turnkeys, public private partnerships or Part V provision.  The main ask of many of us in the Opposition is not that we would have only public sector provision, but that the public sector would carry its fair share of the delivery, particularly of social and affordable homes.<\/p> <p>  It is also not the case that the State is the biggest investor.  This year, the State will invest &euro;1.4 billion of capital expenditure on social housing and a small number of affordable homes.  That is a fraction of the total amount of money that will be invested by the private sector, including by the Housing Finance Agency, private banks and others, in the delivery of housing.  Not only the Opposition, but the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is urging the Government to double direct capital investment in social and affordable housing.  This is at the heart of these amendments because it is what this Bill is about.  The reason almost everybody bar Government is calling for a dramatic increase in direct State investment for the delivery of genuinely affordable housing and more social housing is because the private sector, utilising vehicles such as joint ventures and initiatives, as referenced in these sections of the Bill we are seeking to amend, cannot do that.  That is why the IMF, for which I am no great advocate, increased public expenditure when Fianna F&aacute;il was last in government.  The IMF is arguing that now is the time for Government to borrow at record low interest rates to invest.  That is the right approach because if the Government does not do that it costs more.  <\/p> <p>  I will return to the amendments and what they seek to achieve.  Let us take Kilcarbery site in my constituency as an example, where the Minister and his Government colleagues had a very nice photo shoot recently.  As I understand it, the Minister has approved funding for an approved housing body to deliver cost rental units on that site.  The problem, however, is that that land was previously public land, but it was sold at full market value.  Unlike Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council got full market value for their lands.  The Kilcarbery site was sold at full market value and a developer built properties on it.  An approved housing body is now being funded by Government to buy that property, including the land that was originally sold.  The consequence of that rather bizarre way of funding affordable rental is that the rents will be &euro;1,200 per month, which is not that far off local rents in some parts of the suburbs.  Many of us campaigned for years to have hat site developed.  If Government had done what we are arguing for in our amendments to this Bill, that is, directly funded South Dublin County Council to deliver those homes, the rents in those units would be &euro;800 to &euro;850 per month.  That was confirmed to us in committee hearings with the Department of Finance and Dublin City Council last year.  In using joint ventures, land initiatives and commercial investment vehicles the Government is driving up development costs and, ultimately, affordable purchase and rental will be more expensive.  <\/p> <p>  I would also like to correct the record.  Nobody on this side of the Opposition is opposing any housing development.  What we do not accept is scarce public land being gifted, as is happening in Dublin city and Fingal, through bargain basement prices and sweetheart deals.  For example, 60% of the homes in Donabate will be sold for between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000 and the developers are being given ten years to roll out that site.  That hardly shows the urgency or affordability that the Minister claims.  The biggest objectors to actual housing in our city and county are Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in terms of their objections to between 8,000 and 11,000 homes in the Clondalkin-Clonburris SDZ and the delay of that project for a year through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That was actual votes against actual homes as opposed to voting, as we do, against sweetheart land deals for developers.  <\/p> <p>  I propose to press these amendments.  If we are to deliver large volumes of genuinely affordable homes to rent or buy for working people, we have to get rid of those joint ventures, land initiatives and commercial investment vehicles and do what we know works, from &Oacute; Cualann in Poppintree to Fingal County Council in Lusk, that is, direct delivery of good quality affordable homes for working people by not-for-profits, community co-operatives and our local authorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#J00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>On Deputy Pringle's amendment No. 93, the Minister's response was that there is a requirement for ministerial consent for homes to be sold on.  While that is better than not having a ministerial safeguard, it is not a safeguard in terms of investment funds.  It is the case that the Minister has been a strong backer of several projects of housing being built on public lands where the sites have been sold on to private developers and where we know the housing will end up in the hands of investment funds.<\/p><p>The Minister has been a very strong backer of those projects.  I would not have very much reassurance there.  We need a strong legislative measure to prohibit the LDA selling public lands or homes built on public lands to investment funds.  Without that, given everything that has happened to date and given the Minister's very strong backing for projects where this is in effect what is in the pipeline, I would have serious concerns.  <\/p><p> The Government is certainly not the biggest builder.  It is a very large purchaser of housing.  The Vice Chairman has made the point previously that given amount of money being allocated to purchasing housing through different schemes, the State is not driving down prices and improving affordability as it should be.  That is a cost for the State but it is also a cost for wider society through increases in rents and the prices of homes.  That is what is at the heart of our concerns on this.  We have a model of selling public lands to large developers who already have large land banks in order that they can develop out housing schemes slowly over a ten-year period.  When we have a housing crisis now and need fast delivery of affordable homes now and not over a ten-year period, that is not something the Minister should be trumpeting.

I wish to reiterate the points made by Deputies &Oacute; Broin, Boyd Barrett and Cian O'Callaghan.  With the policy under this Government and the previous Government, which the Minister's party supported, we have seen house prices increase, rents increase and the housing crisis get worse for people trying to get affordable accommodation either to purchase or rent.  These are the facts and there is no disputing that.  In Cork North-Central house prices are increasing each year and so are rents.  Bringing private developers in to develop public lands will only make matters worse.  These amendments propose that public land should be used for public houses.  These are scarce resources.  This land is badly needed to deliver homes for people who need them.<\/p> <p>  Along with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, I attended a housing meeting last night in Cork at which Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke.  One lady described how she has rented a house for herself, her husband and her four children.  They were hoping to buy but they have been renting for 11 years.  Because the rents are so high, they have paid the private landlord more than &euro;100,000 and they are not one step closer to buying - in fact they are worse off now.  They have been given notice to quit and have five months to find a home.<\/p> <p>  This is all as a direct result of Government policies introduced by the past few Governments and which the Minister will now enshrine in this legislation.

That is why Government is introducing measures such as the Affordable Housing Bill, which I hope Deputies will support.  We will bring forward a national cost rental scheme under primary legislation for the first time that will bring for the first time in over a decade direct build, affordable purchase homes.  We are increasing the Part V provisions from 10% to 20% to encompass affordable housing.  We will bring forward our shared equity scheme, which will enable people to get on the housing ladder at an affordable rate.  I hope the Deputies will support those measures.  Deputy Gould at his public meetings with Deputy &Oacute; Broin needs to explain that they do not want the Land Development Agency to build any homes or plan to build any homes.  That is the position they have set out.  That is fine and they are entitled to that position.  I do not have to agree with it, but I respect that position.<\/p> <p>  I have explained very clearly that I cannot and should not accept these amendments because we need to deliver homes for our people in places such as Donabate and St. Kevin's in Cork with which Deputy Gould is very familiar.  When people look at all these sites across the country, they ask why they have not been developed yet.  This Bill will help develop out some of the sites of strategic importance throughout the country to deliver homes for people.  <\/p> <p>  We have had the recent example of some of the Opposition parties voting against 238 affordable homes, 238 social homes and 150 cost rental homes.

We want to have integrated communities.  <\/p> <p>  We fundamentally differ here.  The Government wants a Land Development Agency that will deliver homes.

In other words, we are in favour of affordably purchasable housing on public land as long as it always remains affordable and is never marketised.  Therefore, we are including a provision which would mean that if affordable housing is sold on by somebody who was eligible to purchase it in the first instance, he or she would have to sell it back to the local authority and would not profit from it.  In this way, the property would not become marketised or commodified.  We fully agree with people's aspiration and desire to have security regarding their home.  Given the associated security, it is entirely legitimate that people would decide at some point to move from renting a home to owning their own home.  The State should provide a stock of affordable housing but we do not believe that this housing should later become marketised.  The amendment is a very simple measure stipulating that if an affordable property is sold on at any point, it should be sold back to the local authority.  While reasonable inflation might be taken into account, nobody would make a profit from it.  It would not be difficult to come up with a formula to achieve that.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 219 implies that we need to define &quot;affordability&quot; having regard to people's income.  We are saying the amount should be 25% of somebody's income.  That is a reasonable amount that people would have to expend on either affordable rental or affordable purchase.  It should not be more than that.  The Government and others may argue that the proportion should be increased to one third but people are in some cases spending 50%, 60% or 70% of their after-tax income on rent or a mortgage.  Even with the affordability caps the Government is talking about, it is almost Orwellian to suggest one could still define as affordable a home whose worth is as much as &euro;450,000, or &euro;400,000 in other areas.  It is quite bizarre.  Setting that point aside, we want a reasonable proportion of people's income to dictate the definition of &quot;affordability&quot; with regard to State-provided affordable housing.  Those are the arguments in favour of our two amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#M00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 220 calls for a definition of affordability that is not based on a price just below the prevailing market price or rent but based on the income of the purchaser or tenant.

I will speak to Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendments first.<\/p> <p>  A really important principle is at play here.  One of the great weaknesses of the current affordable housing schemes, as they have been rolled out, obviously prior to the enactment of the affordable housing legislation and the introduction of this legislation, is that where homes are affordable - not all of them are, as we know from earlier discussions - they are affordable only to the first purchaser.  While there is a clawback built into the equity share that the local authority retains to ensure a purchaser cannot make a windfall profit from land he or she did not effectively purchase in the first instance, an affordable property is no longer affordable once sold.  Imagine if, instead of having such schemes, we strategically used public land to build up, over a decade, a stock of thousands of privately owned, permanently affordable, but tradeable, homes.  Whether they would be sold back to the local authority, as is the preference of Deputy Boyd Barrett, or sold directly to the next purchaser in need of an affordable home is a separate issue.  An almost secondary market would be built up.  There would be social and cost-rental homes at one end and private and in many cases unaffordable homes at the other, but there would be thousands of permanently affordable homes that people could buy or sell.  Who are these people?  Currently, they comprise 80% to 85% of the working population based on the eligibility criteria that most of us believe are necessary.  These could be altered.  The measure would ensure that, in perpetuity, we would always have homes that the category of people in question could purchase.<\/p><p>With respect to the proposition put forward by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, this is really important, so-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#M00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>My apologies for interrupting the Deputy.

There is a key difference between how some people have been talking about cost rental in the public arena to date and what cost rental actually is.  Cost rental is not a discounted market rent.  It is not based on purchasing a market price home and setting a rent to repay that.  It is based on a mixture of full cost recovery of the cost of delivering the unit, minus the developer's profit, with some relationship to ability to pay.  It is crucial that, without necessarily opening up a complex differential rent model, the initial rent setting for all cost rental must have some regard to ability to pay.  If you look at those cohorts of people above the threshold for social housing, for whom cost rental will be a key opportunity to have genuinely affordable accommodation, it cannot be above 30%.  In fact, for some income cohorts, unless the social housing thresholds are raised, it would need to be between 27% and 29% of net disposable income if we use definitions similar to those advocated by the ESRI etc.  These are fundamental amendments.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment addresses permanent affordability and Deputy O'Callaghan's addresses affordable rents.

It is not only about the thresholds for social housing lists, which have not been raised in more than ten years and need to be raised.  Deputy Gould said that bank clerks and people with regular jobs need to be included for social housing.  People with regular jobs traditionally would have been able to afford a house.  They are caught, unable to afford a house and outside the social housing net.  Both those thresholds need to be looked at.

Affordability is at the heart of where we need to be, not a market discount.  A market discount means we are going by market prices, which are not a true reflection of affordability.  Affordability should be based on income.  Regarding what Deputy Boyd Barrett said earlier, numerous people have contacted me who have been on the housing waiting list for as long as eight years.  I spoke to a lady last night who has been on the list with her husband for eight and a half years.  They got a pay increase and now they have gone off the social housing list.  How can it be right that a family waited eight and a half years and now they have gone off the social housing list?  They do not qualify or have enough income to get a mortgage.  They do not have the deposit for the mortgage and they are trapped in the middle.  That is why affordable housing has to be based on income and not on the market value, which is the core of what we are saying.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Smith said, when two people had a job in the past, they could get a mortgage.  There is a situation now where even if two people are working full-time, they still cannot get a mortgage in many cases.  That is why we have to make it affordable.  We have to set the rates at between 25% and 30% of a person's income as a guide and not more than 30%, because some people are paying up to 50% or more.

Why on earth would the Minister not want to support that?  I accept Deputy &Oacute; Broin's addition.  My amendment proposes that, if sold, it could only be sold back to the local authority.  I accept we could amend that if the principle was established that it could be traded with other people, but as affordable housing.  There would then be a stock of housing that remains permanently affordable.  The Minister has not given an answer as to why he has a difficulty with that.<\/p> <p>  If he does not do that, then after the first generation of purchasers of affordable housing, the housing on public land will have been turned into unaffordable housing.  As soon as market prices kick in after the first purchase, those houses will revert in my area to &euro;450,00 or &euro;500,000, having been built at the affordable level.  There is no way to describe the consequence of not accepting this amendment other than marketising public land.  Ultimately, we are fuelling the conditions that have given rise to this crisis.<\/p> <p>  The Minister keeps making references to the Affordable Housing Bill but, as we will discuss in the following grouping, the Bill is littered with references to the market being taken into account and being the reference point for the setting of affordability, rather than being based on people's income.<\/p> <p>  Neither did the Minister come back on the point I made and Deputy Duncan Smith echoed.  Why has the Government not raised the income threshold for more than a decade?  Most of the responsibility for that lies with Fine Gael but the Minister is conspicuous in his refusal to answer that question.  I think the secret answer that the Minister will not give is that, slowly but surely, the agenda driven by somebody - I am not sure who but I suspect elements in the permanent government - is to turn social housing into housing that will effectively only be available to people on social welfare.  That is why we have not moved the thresholds upwards so, year on year, working people who used to be able to apply for social housing for no longer able to do so.  Slowly but surely, working people are being excluded from eligibility for social housing.  One has to be on the lowest of incomes, barely above social welfare rates currently, to qualify.<\/p> <p>  If the Minister wants to do something about avoiding segregation in housing, he should address that problem.

I do not support some of the conditionality some seek to put on home ownership.<\/p> <p>  I am well aware of how the serviced sites fund works.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's scheme is a different one.  Of course, people have to pay.  Should the State take an equity under the serviced sites fund, they will have to pay that back.  The Deputy's proposals would put a condition on the house in its totality as to what happens with it, who it goes to or who it is sold to.  I do not believe those provisions are workable.  In the area of affordability, I repeat that Parts 2 and 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill detail what the cost-rental provisions and affordable purchase provisions are.<\/p><p>I will be aligning this Bill with the Affordable Housing Bill.  It is important that is done.  On Report Stage, I will bring forward amendments to Part 9.  It is open to anyone to look at Parts 2 and 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill.  As I have said before in the D&aacute;il, I will be bringing in regulations alongside which set out the eligibility criteria.  The reason for regulations is that they give more flexibility in the future to make changes, particularly when the scheme is new around eligibility.  I want as many people as possible to be able to access affordable housing.  That is what we all want.<\/p><p> Those are the reasons I am opposing amendments Nos. 47, 219 and 220.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#CC01500","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1622502000,"counter":546,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#DD00200","aye":["1453","1550","1468"],"nay":["1574","1597","1566","1626","1568","1561"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 48 and 221 to 225, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#EE00100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 48:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo; &ldquo;cost rental dwellings&rdquo; means dwellings, the rent for which is to be calculated so that it covers only the cost of building (not including the cost of site provision but including the cost of any loans), managing and maintaining the dwellings;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>This amendment is another attempt to extract from this Bill any opportunity for profiteering as much as possible.

For anybody who can go through the tedium of watching 225 amendments, or whatever the number is, being dealt with by an Oireachtas committee, I recommend they look at page 48 of the Bill as initiated.  Under section 76, Price under agreement, the Bill sets out two provisions that show the fundamental flaws in the Government's approach in trying to address the housing crisis through the use of the public land bank.  It links the price it will charge for either affordable purchase housing or for rental property that will be built on public lands to the local market specifically.<\/p><p>Section 76(2) states: &quot;the Minister may prescribe the price, or a method of calculating the price...and may prescribe different prices and different methods in respect of agreements relating to different geographical or administrative areas&quot;.  Section 76(3) states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tFor the purposes of prescribing a price or a method of calculating the price in relation to an area...the Minister shall have regard to the likely future demand for cost rental dwellings and dwellings for sale in the State...<br \/><br \/>(a) the prevailing market price and market rent;  <\/blockquote> <p>Why would one have that in the Bill?  If the Bill's purpose is to provide housing to people who are currently priced out of the market, either the affordable purchase market or the rental market, why on earth would one link the price that the Minister could set to local market conditions?  It totally defeats the purpose.  It guarantees that, in the areas which are at the epicentre of the housing crisis, the very reasons for the crisis will be woven into the structure of the Land Development Agency instead of undermining the dysfunctionality of the market.  It is not setting prices according to the actual affordability criteria for those income groups, now the majority of working people, who are excluded by market prices or market rents.<\/p><p>Why are these sections in the Bill?  They are there because the private developers and so on who have lobbied the Government around all these matters would be horrified at the idea that, in an area where they are selling property from &euro;450,000 to &euro;550,000, or renting property out at between &euro;2,500 or &euro;3,000 a month, the State might, on any sort of substantial scale, build properties that cost &euro;200,000 or could be rented for &euro;800 or &euro;1,000.  These measures have been inserted essentially in order to protect the property developers.<\/p><p>There is no rationale behind these measures.  If the Land Development Agency was actually to develop public and affordable housing on public land, one would have no references to the market or different prices being set dependent on the area in which they were located.<\/p><p>If the Minister can prove I am wrong on this, I would be happy to listen to his argument, but I doubt he can do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#EE00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I am speaking to my amendment No. 224.

Doing so reduces the value of the land cost, so when housing is built, the land value has been eliminated from it.  While there have been many characterisations of what this Bill does, that is the reality of what it does.<\/p> <p>  Like Deputy Higgins, I am hoping to reflect that term \"affordable land value\".

To row it back a little bit, people will recall this Bill was published before the Affordable Housing Bill.  That is why I intend to bring forward amendments on Report Stage, especially to Part 9, including section 76, which will align the Land Development Agency, the affordability piece and the definitions with the Affordable Housing Bill.  It is important that is done to provide the additional clarity around this.  We will do so by way of amendments.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Higgins and Deputy McAuliffe are correct.  You will have a heavily discounted land value based on the affordable land value and the proportion of a site which is designated affordable or cost rental.  I agree with Deputies that there is more work to be done in this space.  When this Bill was published, we did not have the full definitions of how our Affordable Housing Bill would work.  That Bill is currently in the Seanad.  The job we need to do on Report Stage is to marry the two and that is what we will do.<\/p> <p>  Section 76 and Part 9 will be fully aligned with the cost rental, which is under Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill, and with the affordable purchase.  That will become clearer for Deputies as we get to Report Stage.

That is a good start.  However, he cannot tell us what it will be replaced with, only that it will be broadly aligned with the Affordable Housing Bill.  I would like the Minister to tell us as much as he can about that because it is not satisfactory we are now on Committee Stage of this Bill and we do not know what the Government will do on Report Stage.  We have not seen the Report Stage amendments the Government will make on this critical point of whether the LDA is capable of delivering affordable housing on public land.<\/p> <p>  The Government appears to be acknowledging the point of my amendment, which is to say there should not be any relationship between how you price affordablility and local market conditions.  Is the Minister accepting this is correct, that local market conditions should not be criteria for setting the price of affordable housing or affordable rental?  That would be an important step forward by the Government.  I am happy to admit when the Government puts its hands up and says it was wrong and will change things.  Is the Minister saying we are right that the benchmark against prices and rents at the local market level is not an acceptable way of defining affordability?  If that is in any way a criterion, I put it to the Minister that he essentially will have undermined the attempt to deal with the housing crisis and the affordability crisis in the areas where these crises are most acute and where the response is most badly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#FF00700","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Smith's amendment.  I will not repeat the points other than to say we have to have a definition of affordability, particularly affordable rental, which is linked to people's income and ability to pay.  I will support any amendment which attempts to do that.  I also support Deputy Higgins' amendment in principle because there has been confusion in the public arena around much of the debate on land values.<\/p> <p>  There should be no reference to market value anywhere in this legislation, because market value is the open market value of land when it is sold on the open market and is determined by the zoning of that land.  The vast majority of land we are talking about has an existing use value.  The existing use value should be the guide.<\/p> <p>  The problem is, when you change the use of the land, the valuation changes.  Shanganagh Castle is an illustrative example.  That land had an existing use value of approximately &euro;9 million.  That is how much D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council paid the Department of Justice for the purchase of that land.<\/p><p>Its existing use was the value of that land, which sat on the balance sheet of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  When one decides to develop that land with a mixture of social, affordable rental and affordable sale the land values change.  Social continues to have existing use value and that does not change.  The market value if one uses the terminology in the Minister's Bill of the cost rental is now determined by the lifetime yields that can be gained from ownership of those cost-rental units and that is a separate valuation.  Likewise, the market value of the land on which the affordable purchase is not determined by the purchase price of the home today but the imputed future value of the sale price of the home, including the market value of the land because, of course, under the Minister's scheme one can sell those properties into the private market at a future point in time.  The idea that what is proposed in this Bill will give one a zero or existing use value for any lands, from public bodies transferred to the LDA, is simply not the case.<\/p><p> The Dundrum central sites are also very important.  Let us imagine a portion of the Dundrum central sites is unaffordable open market price.  We do not know what the designation will be but let us give the Minster the benefit of the doubt and let us say he restricts it right down to 10% or 20%.  In the market value of that land would be three separate calculations: the proportion of land that is social, which is the existing use value; the portion that is affordable rental for sale, the imputed yields or future value of the sale of the property; and then there is the open market value, which would be the full market price.  That is the way this is going to be calculated.  The suggestion that I have heard from some Government backbenchers, not on this committee but in my conversations with them, that they have been told not to worry and that the provision is just a way of getting around EU state aid rules and to avoid a legal challenge from some private developer who wants to buy one of these pieces of land but fears that the LDA is getting illegal state aid is, I think, a risky road to go down.  We should only be talking about existing use value or the book value of the land, whichever is the lowest because no one should profit from land that is currently unused and sitting with the HSE, the Office of Public Works or Irish Rail and transferred to any public entity whose job is to deliver social and affordable homes.  I say that because any increase in the value of the land, and it is transferable, increases development costs and the prices of those homes to rent or buy.<\/p><p> I would not have drafted the amendment as Deputy Higgins has done but her point is an important one.  We need to make sure that if land is to be transferred then it must done at the lowest possible price and that is the existing use value or the book value of the land, whichever is lower.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#FF00800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their comments and amendments.<\/p> <p>  Let us remember that this legislation is about setting up a land development agency and it is not the Affordable Housing Bill.  We are going to align the parts that relate to definitions so cost rental and affordable purchase will be aligned exactly with the Affordable Housing Bill that is in the Seanad at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider cost rental for argument's sake.  Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill, which is where it should be because the main piece of legislation is the Affordable Housing Bill in terms of the provision of affordable homes be they for rent or purchase.  That Bill sets out in great detail the details of the estimated total cost that was referred to and the definitions for cost rental itself.<\/p> <p> The criteria around eligibility will be published by way of regulation.  I expect that members will agree that that makes absolute sense because should levels change within eligibility then one needs that flexibility to be able to change them but they will be published alongside it too.<\/p> <p>  There is no admission of any issues here whatsoever.  It is very simply that the Land Development Agency Bill was published in advance of the Affordable Housing Bill.  Both Bills are now moving through the Houses.  We want to align one with the other and that is exactly what we are going to do by way of the Affordable Housing Bill itself.  We will also make sure that the LDA uses the definitions of the Affordable Housing Bill for both affordable purchase and affordable rental.<\/p> <p> To get to the point made about affordable value and a discounted land value, it will be the case that they will be heavily discounted on the market value based on the proportion of affordable and social homes on the State agency's site.  That is a fact and is what will happen.  That is the whole purpose of being able to drive affordability and use our lands to deliver social homes.  This will help in the provision of those affordable purchase units, in particular.<\/p> <p>  Some of these amendments may be more appropriate to the Affordable Housing Bill.  They are certainly not appropriate to this Bill.  I will bring forward further amendments to Part 9 of this Bill, including section 76, which we have talked about here, on Report Stage so that there is that exact alignment between both pieces of legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#GG00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I will press my amendment.

I think everyone knows there is no intention that any lands such as the Phoenix Park would be used by the LDA, nor will that ever happen.  The Bill deals with relevant public lands, which are lands in the ownership of public bodies in population areas of more than 10,000.  Section 3 of the Phoenix Park Act 1925 confirms that the park is for the general purpose of recreation and enjoyment by the public.  The majority of parks and heritage sites will be outside the scope of the definition in this amendment.  Where such sites are in more urban areas, however, they are included on the register of relevant public lands.  That is all.  I take Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about the website, but that is a prototype.  It may have led to some confusion, which we have flagged.  Senator Moynihan raised this a number of weeks ago.  There is absolutely no question that any of our public parks, including the Phoenix Park, would be taken over by the LDA.  Let us look at all the checks and balances in the Bill.  It is important to note that the inclusion of land as a relevant public land on the register does not mean it is to be used for housing.<\/p> <p>  As for the aim of the register, and going back to our disagreements at the start as to whether or not the LDA should build homes, everyone has said the agency should have a register of public land.

The key issue is that there are many sections of this Bill which give the Minister significant powers to introduce regulations governing the operation of the LDA, land transfers and acquisitions and other matters.  As the Minister well knows, when, for example, there is a proposed change to planning regulations, there is a very straightforward procedure whereby the Minister consults the relevant Oireachtas committee and then a motion is laid before the D&aacute;il to approve or not approve said regulations.  I fully understand that regulations are primarily a function of the Minister and the Government, but the Minister was before the committee recently to consult on changes to planning regulations in the context of Covid-19, which he discussed and which we strongly welcomed, and that level of transparency and accountability is very important.  These four amendments are in the spirit of greater accountability, transparency and respect for the functions of the Oireachtas.  I hope the Minister will be able to support them or to give an undertaking that he will examine them to see if it is possible to bring forward amendments of his own on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#HH00900","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":581,"content":"<p>To clarify, we are on amendments Nos. 52, 53 and 54, so it is three amendments we are discussing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#HH01000","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I am discussing just the first three.

In the previous Oireachtas, we went through very detailed pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme of the previous LDA Bill.  We have made sure in this Bill that there is full oversight on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as oversight from and a report to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and FOI provisions, and rightly so.  This is significant change, the latter provisions in particular, from the first iteration of the Bill.  I imagine that any Minister will consult committees, but what Deputy &Oacute; Broin is seeking here is that every time a Minister made a regulation that relates to the LDA or a direction to the LDA, he or she would have to consult the Oireachtas committee on every single one of them.  It is a standard provision that a Minister may make regulations or issue directions as and when required without prior consultation with the committee.  Regulations and ministerial directions will be made in accordance with the Bill and will be enacted following the approval of the Oireachtas.  However, it is normal practice as part of the governance of State agencies - I am not just talking about the LDA - that a Minister may issue a direction to an agency.<\/p> <p>  I know where Deputy &Oacute; Broin is coming from, but to propose that an agency and, in addition, in this specific instance, any future Minister would have to consult before giving a direction or issuing a regulation for the agency would, I think, result in a very heavy burden being placed on the Minister in making decisions relating to the agency and would slow down the process.  Having said that, these directions generally relate to the implementation of government policy, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin will know, and the LDA will absolutely be required to comply with any direction issued to it under this section.  As I said, the LDA and the Minister will work with the Oireachtas committee in the normal course of events, but having to consult the Oireachtas committee before issuing any direction or regulation is not something that is done with other State agencies, so I cannot accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#HH01800","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Oacute; Broin wish to discuss amendment No. 54 now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#HH01900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Yes.

They are a response to concerns raised on Second Stage about subsidiary designated activity companies, DACs.<\/p><p>The amendments provide for the inclusion of \"or a subsidiary DAC\" in a number of sections.  I am introducing the amendments to provide clarity and absolute certainty and to remove any lingering doubt whatsoever that the provisions of the Bill that apply to the LDA will also apply to any of its subsidiary DACs.  That was raised on the Second Stage debate.  It was always the intention of this legislation when it was being drafted that references to the LDA would also refer to a subsidiary DAC, but for the avoidance of doubt, in the interests of trying to be helpful and to provide clarity, I am moving these amendments today.  There has been some misleading commentary on the establishment of the LDA and its subsidiaries as designated activity companies under the Companies Act, as if to imply that this is in some way irregular.  I take the opportunity to clarify again that it is standard practice to establish newly created State companies as DACs.<\/p><p> I will now highlight the sections that are being amended so people are clear.  Section 7 relates to directions of the Minister.  The making of directions by the Minister to the agency in the performance of its functions will also apply to subsidiary DACs.  Section 21 relates to membership of either House of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or local government.  The provisions regarding board members and staff ceasing or being seconded from their roles if they become a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or a member of a local authority will also apply to board members and staff of subsidiary DACs.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 134 deletes section 32(2)(a) and replaces it with a new provision in relation to the establishment of subsidiary DACs that provides that the LDA must obtain prior ministerial consent for the provisions in the constitutions of such subsidiaries that relate to the ownership and control of it.  It was always the intent of this section that the LDA would need ministerial consent, but I want to clarify that ministerial approval is required in relation to the establishment of DACs as well as the ownership and control of them.  In effect, the LDA will need to seek consent before it establishes any subsidiaries and clarify the ownership of them.  It has always been intended that the LDA would establish subsidiary DACs, as this is in line with similar provisions for other commercial State bodies.  There is nothing sinister in this, it is standard practice.  A range of controls is in place in this legislation and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies in relation to the oversight of the LDA and its subsidiaries.  In addition, NewERA will continue to provide advice to my Department on the oversight of the agency.  Again, this is in line with provisions for other commercial State bodies.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 184 deletes section 55 and replaces it with more detailed provisions regarding the disposal of land by the LDA or a subsidiary DAC.  First, it clarifies that a subsidiary DAC, in line with the LDA, must seek ministerial consent to dispose of land, but that this consent is not required where it is disposing of a single house for rent or purchase.  We discussed the issue to some extent earlier.  This had always been the intent of the section but it is important to clarify it.<\/p><p> Second, I am bringing an amendment to provide that the LDA or a subsidiary DAC must seek ministerial approval where more than one house is being sold as part of linked transactions.  In other words, it will not be able to dispose of more than one house to a single purchaser without seeking ministerial approval.  Of course, there will be occasions where it would be appropriate for the LDA or a subsidiary DAC to sell more than one unit to a single purchaser such as a local authority or an affordable housing body.  Again, we discussed this earlier.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 194 inserts a new provision in section 59 to provide that in relation to compulsory purchase, land owned by the agency includes land owned by a subsidiary DAC.  This again is for clarity, if needed, and the avoidance of doubt, and does not change the intent of this section in any way, shape or form.  It ensures that the LDA may acquire land compulsorily where it is required to provide access to relevant public land and land owned by the LDA or a subsidiary DAC or is required to facilitate the provision of infrastructure on relevant public land or land owned by the LDA or a subsidiary DAC.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 231 is a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment so I will not speak to that one.  The other amendments in this group are Nos. 228, 229 and 230, which amend section 78 to clarify that freedom of information will apply to subsidiary DACs.  This is a point I made very strongly when in opposition with regard to the need for the agency to be subject to FOI, which it is.  I am making sure, for the avoidance of any doubt, that subsidiary DACs are also included.  Section 78 of the LDA Bill provides that the Freedom of Information Act 2014 will fully apply to the LDA from establishment day and also provides that records held by the dissolved LDA body will continue to be subject to FOI.  That is important as it is will ensure transparency in the agency's operations.  These amendments amend this section to provide that they will apply to subsidiaries of the LDA, which will be subject to FOI with effect from establishment day.  That has always been my intention.  I said that previously and I do not want to repeat it, but this is a belt and braces to ensure that people are really clear and refrain from making remarks to the contrary in future now that they are fully tied in.<\/p><p> The effective date for FOI for both the LDA and its subsidiaries will be 13 March 2019.  This is the effective date, when the existing interim LDA entity's records became subject to FOI, and by applying this effective date to both the commercial LDA and its subsidiaries it will ensure that all LDA functions and operations will be subject to FOI.  That is important for the sake of transparency.  I want to make it clear that the LDA will be fully accountable to FOI and will come fully under the remit of FOI from establishment day and the normal provision whereby a new State body is not accountable under FOI for a period of six months from the date it is established will not apply to the LDA or any of its subsidiaries.  It is important that the LDA is fully transparent in its operations and the amendments to this section will further clarify that.  The management of the LDA is also fully committed to this principle.  I acknowledge that Deputies have introduced amendments on this issue and I hope they will accept these amendments to clarify that the LDA and its subsidiaries will be fully accountable under FOI, as this is in the interests of all involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#KK00900","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Oacute; Broin wish to speak to amendment No. 231?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#LL00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I will speak to the full group if that is okay.  I warmly welcome all of these amendments.  From the very outset I had a genuine concern about the extent to which FOI, but also other provisions of this Bill, fully applied to the subsidiary designated activity companies.  As some Members will be aware, the original design of the LDA Bill under the previous Government separated its commercial and non-commercial activities.  Its non-commercial activities were to be subject to FOI and the commercial activities were to be excluded.  When I got the draft of this Bill, I wrote to the Information Commissioner asking in particular for his expert opinion on the extent to which the FOI legislation would apply to subsidiary DACs in the pre-amendment section 78.  He confirmed in writing that because there was not a date of establishment for the subsidiary DACs, there would be a window - the Minister referred to the exact same six-month period - where they would not be covered.  In the first instance, I am more than happy to withdraw my amendment No. 231 because the Minister's three amendments before that adequately deal with it much more eloquently than I would have done and his previous amendments also capture a series of other loopholes.<\/p><p> This is very important.  While it is welcome, there is a big difference between the extent of transparency from a commercially established designated activity company, albeit one that is publicly owned, and a State agency that is non-commercial.  For example, I can submit a parliamentary question or a question to a local authority manager on the full costings of live social and affordable housing projects, full costings on land transfers and full costings on the details of residential development and they are obliged under law or practice to provide those.  Unfortunately, a designated activity company or a subsidiary DAC does not have the same obligation.  The minutes of the LDA have been put on the website and I welcome the fact that the agency put them on the website but they are largely redacted.  It is important that members fully understand this.  I genuine welcome the Minister's move on this but it does not mean there will be the level of transparency in the operations of the LDA, the principal DAC or subsidiary DACs.<\/p><p> There will be members of this committee - some of them may be in government today, but they could be in opposition in future - who will want by right access to information about public land and public money.  We will not get it.  The best example is if we look at public private partnerships.  All the financial details around the first and second tranche of PPP social housing is withheld from elected members on the grounds of commercial sensitivity.  That would be the case with the LDA and with LDA subsidiary DAC activities.  Elected members in local authorities and Members of this House will at times be asked whether to support large residential developments without having any visibility of public finance.<\/p><p> This is good news but it is not the same level of transparency or accountability that we would have from a non-commercial state agency.  It is important that members understand that.  That is the consequence of a commercial DAC and it is one major limitation in the way in which this project is being structured.  Anyway, I fully support the Minister's amendments and I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 231.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#LL00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":611,"content":"<p>The last point there was the one I wanted to make.  I will underline it.  Even if subsidiary DACs are subject to freedom of information law, the commercial sensitivity issues kick in as soon as we involve private commercial interests.  In negotiations between State bodies and local authorities and publicly owned agencies or entities and any form of private commercial interest, those commercial sensitivity issues come in to play.  As a result, we do not actually get to see the financial detail.  I have been through this saga.  I will cite as an instance in this regard the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.  We successfully campaigned to get the company dissolved and reintegrated into the council.  For the years it was in operation, however, we could not find out anything about what it was doing.  Notionally, permission had to be sought from the Minister for Transport but in actuality the board of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company decided everything and got everything rubber-stamped from the relevant Ministers.  The truth is that the local councillors or Deputies could not get any information.  Commercial sensitivity was wheeled out for everything.  We were told we could not be given certain information because it was commercially sensitive.  That is what will happen here.  It is one of the key flaws and follies of the whole enterprise as conceived by the Government.  Once we bring in arrangements with private business through these DAC structures, commercial sensitivity issues will kick in.<\/p> <p>  The Minister may claim some credit on amendment No. 184 for requiring ministerial approval for the disposal of land by the DACs but it does not take away from the fact that the cardinal problem is that the DACs will be able to dispose of public land.  There are some safeguards but to my mind the safeguards against that are not adequate to protect against the slippery slope or the fact that in reality the driver will be the LDA and not the Minister.  Councillors will be last to know.  It will be the LDA driving things and getting them rubber-stamped by Ministers.  That is my experience of these bodies.  To be honest, I do not believe that as time goes on anything will be different with the LDA and these DACs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#MM00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to press amendment No. 55?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#MM00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Yes, I am pressing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#MM00400","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622502000,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 56:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, line 23, after &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and a subsidiary DAC&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#MM00600","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622502000,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":617,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 57 and 58 may be taken together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#MM00800","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 57:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(4)The content of any such direction shall be published in <i>Iris Oifiguil<\/i>, in at least one national newspaper, and on the websites of the Minister and of the Land Development Agency.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote> <p>As members will know, we had an important presentation and written submission by the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, which represents local authority councillors from all parties and none, when representatives presented to us some weeks ago.  They expressed significant concerns about large parts of this legislation.  While they were not opposed to the principle of a land development agency engaged in land management and residential development they were genuinely concerned that it would see a sidelining of the role of local authorities.  The fear was that the important work of our local councillors representing local communities would not be taken into account to the same extent as it would be currently with the likes of city and county development plans, strategic development zones, local area plans and Part 8 planning applications, not to mention the thorny issue of section 183 land transfers, which councillors come up against.<\/p><p>The AILG submitted a significant number of amendments and I was more than happy to table them.  These are the first two.  Amendment No. 57 specifically has a requirement that a direction from the Minister will be published in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il<\/i>and at least one nationwide newspaper as well as on the websites of the Minister and the LDA.  This is important.  This is the argument of the AILG not of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The AILG makes it clear that this is to ensure transparency.  The fear of the AILG representatives is that with the section as currently worded local authorities would not have visibility of a ministerial directive relative to the LDA.  That could have significant implications for the local authority, elected members and the wider community in terms of housing and planning operations.<\/p><p>I will set out the position with respect to amendment No. 58 as someone who argued strongly against the strategic housing development legislation in 2016 when others abstained and allowed it to go through.  One of the reasons we are seeing an increasing number of large residential housing developments being challenged in the courts is because they are over-riding the city and county development plans.  They are actively excluding not only elected members but, crucially, local communities from constructively participating in good planning practices.  Amendment No. 58 explicitly requires the Minister to ensure that any directive should have regard to city and county development plans, local area plans and other statutory plans made by the local authority.  Given that we now have the Office of the Planning Regulator to ensure consistency in the new round of city and county development plans with Government planning policy, I can see no reason why the Minister would not accept these two reasonable amendments.  Again, I emphasise they are not Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  They are cross-party and no-party amendments tabled by AILG.  I hope the Minister will accept both and I will be interested to hear his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#MM00900","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#MM01000","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I see Deputy Boyd Barrett has his hand up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#MM01100","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Is it an old hand or a new hand that Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#NN00100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":622,"content":"<p>It is an old hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#NN00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I was wondering whether Deputy Boyd Barrett might come in one of these days and welcome something.

I am not accepting the amendment as ministerial directions will always have due regard to the planning code.  They have to.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, will seek planning permission for its proposed developments through the appropriate procedures under the Planning and Development Acts in the same manner as any other developer.  In making decisions in respect of proposed LDA developments, the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to make its determinations in accordance with the provisions of the relevant development plans, local area plans and strategic development zones that are in force and to which the development site is subject.  A number of LDA developments have already been brought through the planning system.  Members will know the development at Shanganagh Castle very well.  Another such development, mentioned in Deputy Gould's observations, is that at the St. Kevin's Hospital site in Cork city.  All planning authorities provide access to pre-application consultations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised the issue of strategic housing developments, SHDs.  I have been very clear that that the legislation underpinning SHDs is going to expire and I will not be extending it.  I would not conflate the LDA with the SHD process.  The Deputy is trying to muddy the water in this space.  I will not be accepting these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#NN00700","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I again stress that these amendments were carefully considered by the largest representative organisation for local government councillors in the State, an organisation whose members include councillors from all of our parties.  Given that this legislation will have such a profound impact on the role of our local authorities, which may be for the better or for the worse depending on one's point of view, I would hope that it will get more consideration.<\/p> <p>  To return to my point on the SHDs, the Minister is right that he has given the commitment he has mentioned.  It would, of course, have been much better if he or his party had listened to the Opposition back in 2016 when his party colleague, Deputy Cowen, was their housing spokesperson and if they had then opposed the SHD legislation.  The Irish Planning Institute, a range of local authority sectors and we in the Opposition fully understood where it would go and we were proved correct.  My point is a different one.  The SHD legislation created a planning mechanism whereby city and county development plans, local area plans and other plans could be overridden.  That has caused considerable difficulty.  That is why, for example, local authorities are taking An Bord Plean&aacute;la to court for breaches of those plans.  That is why, in this instance, this is really necessary.  <\/p> <p>  I do not believe it is the Minister's intention to use the LDA in the way in which his predecessor used the SHD process.  I want to put that on the record.  However, unless we have a belt and braces approach, to use the phrase the Minister himself used with regard to the last group of amendments, to ensure that the decisions on which elected members democratically agree after substantial public consultation with regard to city county development plans, local area plans and, crucially, strategic development zones, a particularly contentious issue with regard to Dublin's docklands, are fully respected, a local authority could, in the future, potentially find itself at legal loggerheads with the LDA and the board over, for example, a strategic development zone that conflicts with a county development plan or local area plan.  That would not be a healthy place for any of us to be.  It would delay residential development and would delay and undermine good quality place making and planning.  On that basis, I again urge the Minister and members of the committee to support these two amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060100002#NN00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I do not mean to cut across Deputy &Oacute; Broin but, to be helpful, I will have a further look at amendment No. 58 to see how to incorporate the approach I mentioned in the phrase I used to which the Deputy made reference.

I want to acknowledge that.  I thank all members of the committee for the opportunity to highlight matters related to the Traveller accommodation crisis and to consider actions to alleviate the ongoing crisis in delivering a home for Travellers.<\/p> <p>  Despite legislative protection since 1998, there are currently 2,000 families living in inadequate, unsafe conditions in shared and overcrowded accommodation or on roadsides.  The current Traveller accommodation programmes show a need nationally to supply for 2,871 families.  While this figure is thought to be an underestimate, either way, the current programmes are not fit for purpose and only 22 local authorities plan to address the full identified need in their area.  It is important to remember that when I am talking about statistics, I am talking about Traveller men, women and especially children who are forced to live in dreadful conditions, even today, in Ireland in 2021.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, just 16 new units of Traveller-specific accommodation were built or refurbished - seven houses, no additional bays and nine welfare units.  So far this year, just &euro;1.7 million has been drawn down from the Traveller accommodation capital budget, a repeated pattern by local authorities since the beginning of the programmes.  There is low intention but sanctions have not been put in place.  Between the years 2008 and 2019, more than &euro;72 million was unspent by local authorities, without the necessary oversight in place to intervene and with no sanctions applied.  Investment by Government declined from &euro;120 million for the first Traveller accommodation programme, TAP,from 2000 to 2004 to just &euro;33 million for the latest TAP.  Annual budgets showed the allocation in 2008 was &euro;40 million compared to just &euro;14.5 million in 2020.  The sad reality is that regardless of the amount of the budget that is put aside and set for Traveller-specific accommodation, year after year, it goes unspent.  That has to change because Traveller children are left in dire conditions.  There is no excuse for that in Ireland today, especially when the money is there.  The budget is not the issue.<\/p> <p>  Despite the report of the expert review in 2019, the 2017 review of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation and the implementation of TAPs by the Housing Agency, there is still no national oversight or accountability when local authorities set low or no targets for delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation, do not account for future population growth in their plans and do not reach their own targets within the period.  I have to beg the question of what other community this would be done to, and what other children would be left without toilets and without water, not just now, but for decades.<\/p> <p>  Travellers are more disproportionately affected than any other group in official homeless figures, accounting for as high as 50% of people within the homeless emergency services, despite comprising less than 1% of the overall population.  We have heard testimonies and heartbreaking stories of families living for close to four years in emergency accommodation, driving an 80 km distance to another county to try to save their children&rsquo;s education.  That should not be happening in today&rsquo;s Ireland.  Thousands more families are trapped in hidden homelessness caused by grossly inadequate and overcrowded accommodation, and they are not even recognised as homeless.  Some are sharing bays, houses or rundown trailers, often on local authority-owned sites where these conditions are known by local authorities.  Many wake up to leaking roofs, rats, chronic damp and mould on their blankets, and some are forced to share a Portaloo with 15 other people.  This is their normal, forced state of living.<\/p> <p>  There are 2,800 Travellers living on unofficial sites, most without stable electricity, sanitation or any security of tenure.  They risk eviction on a daily basis and criminalisation for being Travellers, but with no place to go.  Babies are born into situations that in any other country would be deemed an international scandal but, unfortunately, in Ireland, it is brushed under the carpet.  Some poor little babies have chronic health conditions and come home to a situation where they cannot access a stable electricity supply to support their medical equipment.<\/p> <p>  These figures and these heartbreaking stories are unacceptable by any standard.  Behind them are families, humans, Travellers.  We heard powerful stories in the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report last week, where Traveller children described their home as &ldquo;like an abandoned place that people forgot about.  It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re forgotten.  We feel like garbage&rdquo;.  No child should be inflicted with that trauma but, unfortunately, Traveller children are.  Those children number upwards of 3,000.  While the site in Cork investigated is among the worst in the country, there are many across the country, especially in Dublin's four local authorities.  An Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, report covering all local authority Traveller accommodation responsibilities is still awaited, almost two years after its planned publication.  Again, it must be a priority to have that published.  Children on those sites are unduly burdened by the inaction of local authorities, which are duty-bound to provide accommodation but instead have failed them.  We know that the insecurity arising from poor accommodation has a profound effect on life opportunities and has been the cause of many of my community experiencing intergenerational poverty, disadvantage, poor health and trauma.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 highlighted the crisis further and brought it more centre stage.  While the ministerial intervention offered in 2020 is to be applauded, unfortunately, much was left undone.<\/p><p>So far this year, just &euro;89,550 has been drawn down for this purpose.  The outcomes of a report on the 31 local authorities&rsquo; responses to Covid-19 in Traveller accommodation are unclear.  It took Covid-19 for some families to get water and portable toilets as a temporary emergency measure.  If Covid-19 had not come into our lives, those families would still be without water and portable toilets.  There has to be a strategy where those services are permanent to families and their permanent accommodation needs are met.<\/p><p> We welcome progress being made in establishing the programme board to oversee recommendations of the expert review of Traveller accommodation.  These need to be accelerated as soon as possible and time made up for delays in 2020.  There is a need for an independent national Traveller accommodation authority to oversee those recommendations.  Funds must be ring-fenced for implementation of the 32 recommendations.  Otherwise, we fear they will not be implemented and the good work that is starting to happen will be undone.  It is crucial a circumventing of Part 8 of the planning process to An Bord Plean&aacute;la should feature in the future plans as recommended by the expert group.<\/p><p> Criminalising nomadism represents the State's policy going back to the 1963 Report of the Commission on Itinerancy, which set the tone for decades afterwards.  It was a report that was developed about us without us.  We must be the generation to undo the damage and undo the trauma that inflicted.  The only way we can do that is by working together to ensure the 32 recommendations of the expert group report are implemented so that Traveller children no longer suffer and are no longer hidden on the margins of society.<\/p><p> We refer the Chair to the recommendations made in our submission to the committee and are happy to provide any further information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms RoseMarie Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Maughan for her very powerful presentation.

The National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum is a national network of Traveller women and Traveller organisations throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As minority ethnic women, Traveller women and girls are among the most marginalised and excluded individuals and groups in Ireland, experiencing poorer health and educational outcomes, extreme poverty, inadequate housing, high levels of unemployment, discrimination and racism, and lack of access to mainstream services.<\/p> <p>  Housing has a particular effect on Traveller women as they spend more time in the home and are the primary carers, so they bear the brunt of having to cope with the most basic conditions such as a lack of clean running water, lack of adequate refuse collection, poor sanitation and unsafe areas for children to play in.<\/p> <p>  There are also huge shortcomings in provision for Traveller women experiencing violence against them.  The refuges provided in Ireland do not meet the Istanbul Convention standards of one family place per 10,000 population.  It has also highlighted the lack of gendered analysis of homelessness, which means women and children fleeing domestic violence are not categorised as homeless, nor are they integrated into strategies dealing with housing and homelessness.  This has meant refuges struggle to access resources and referral pathways for women when it comes to accessing safe and secure accommodation and housing.<\/p> <p>  As one of the key determinants of health, accommodation has also contributed to Traveller children being 3.6 times more vulnerable to not surviving the first year of their life, and to 50% being not expected to live beyond the age of 40 years.  The recent report by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, No End in Site, presents a very chilling insight into the lives of children living on a site where there has been 30 years of failure by a local authority.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government's annual count reported for 2019 that more than one in ten Travellers, or 13.5%, are effectively homeless.  These statistics obscure the reality of homelessness and accommodation conditions within the Traveller community.<\/p> <p>  We have a Traveller accommodation crisis and a wider housing crisis in Ireland, and the long-term lack of accommodation provision has pushed many Travellers into sharing accommodation and onto overcrowded and unauthorised sites.  These families are not reflected in Government statistics on homelessness, and we know the situation is deteriorating.  Some 504 Travellers were in emergency accommodation in the Dublin area in 2019 and 23% of homeless families in Kerry are Traveller families.  Anecdotally, we also know that 50% of families in homeless services in Galway city are Travellers.<\/p> <p>  Living in overcrowded conditions has prevented Traveller women self-isolating when they have contracted Covid-19.  The lack of access to running water makes it difficult to comply with guidelines on hand hygiene and social distancing in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.   The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on Travellers as well as having a particular impact on women and girls.  Issues that Traveller women face in terms of housing and homelessness have been greatly exacerbated, especially for those most vulnerable in the communities.  While the Traveller accommodation unit, TAU, in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage issued a circular for local authorities advising them to take all necessary measures to ensure safety of Traveller families, there were still issues in the roll-out of Covid-19 measures at local level in some local authorities.  In these instances, funding and guidance was not a barrier at national level.<\/p> <p>  The implementation of the recommendations of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act expert review in full is crucial to ensuring an adequate supply and adequate standards of culturally appropriate accommodation for Travellers.  Clear timelines, a budget for implementation, tangible targets with corresponding accountability measures along with strong Traveller engagement at all levels will be essential for delivery.  The Government must commit to including clear actions, targets, indicators, outcomes, timeframes and adequate resources in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy and the National Strategy for Women and Girls to address the accommodation and homelessness crisis experienced by Traveller women and girls.  Women and children being accommodated in emergency refuge accommodation must be represented in homeless statistics, and additional funding is needed to ensure women living in violent situations are fast-tracked to access secure and affordable long-term housing options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bridget Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kelly for her presentation.

I hope that day will not be too far into the future.<\/p><p> When opening this session, the Chairperson used the term \"witness\".  It is an appropriate term in this context because the three national organisations are again today bearing witness to the ongoing systemic failure of this State to meet the accommodation needs of Travellers.  Ms Kelly and Ms Maughan very eloquently articulated some of the very shocking statistics that are a manifestation of that failure.  There has been an increase in the number of Travellers becoming homeless and an increase in the number of Travellers living in overcrowded conditions on sites and group housing schemes, which bring many problems in terms of fire hazards and tension among families.<\/p><p> The unspent budget has been already alluded to.  Since 2017, &euro;69 million has been unspent on Traveller accommodation, which is shocking.  The Traveller budget in 2000 was &euro;135 million.  In 2017, it was &euro;20 million.  Despite that the budget has been reduced, it is still not being fully utilised or drawn down by the local authorities to meet the basic human rights of many Traveller families throughout the State.  The implications of this are severe in terms of access to education, employment, healthcare and mental health well-being.  These are manifestations of people being forced to live in cramped, overcrowded conditions and not having access to basic services such as electricity, water, sanitation or refuse collection.  As already alluded to, this was amplified in the context of Covid-19 when many Travellers could not comply with the basic public health guidelines in terms of social distancing and handwashing.  If that does not constitute a humanitarian crisis, I do not know what does.  We have to be honest and name it a humanitarian crisis.<\/p><p> The Irish State has been consistently in breach of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, which places a legal obligation on local authorities to undertake an accommodation needs assessment and to develop TAPs on that basis.  International human rights bodies have found Ireland to be in breach of its obligations in terms of the provision of Traveller accommodation.  The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and many others have found Ireland to be in breach of its international human rights obligations, and this continues to be the case.<\/p><p> In terms of what needs to happen, the problems have been well rehearsed and well documented by all of the Traveller organisations and well articulated today by all of the witnesses.  We have also come up with solutions,such as, for example, the call for a moratorium on evictions.  It is immoral that local authorities continue to evict Travellers when those same local authorities have failed to implement their Traveller accommodation programmes and failed to draw down the budget available in that regard from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  A moratorium on evictions is vital.  This has been called for by other international human rights organisations.  We also need a national independent agency whose remit is to drive forward Traveller policy on a whole range of fronts.<\/p><p> It is clear to all of us that the local authority system structure is inherently unable and incapable of providing Travellers with their basic accommodation needs.  Traveller accommodation is too heavily politicised at local authority level.  Many public representatives are, unfortunately, objecting to Traveller accommodation, playing the race card.  We see that all too frequently.  We know that many local authorities are not brave enough even to propose building Traveller accommodation.  Therefore, the evidence points in one direction, that is, this power needs to be taken away from the local authorities.  They have failed miserably.  We need a new approach and a new structure and a depoliticising of these issues such that we can get on and do the job that needs to be done.  In that regard, I am reminded of a quote from Jean-Claude Juncker, a former President of the European Commission, when addressing a conference a number of years ago on Roma and Traveller issues.  He said, \"We all know what to do, but we don't know how to get re-elected once we have done it.\"  That is the core issue, that is, the issue of Traveller accommodation is too heavily politicised.  There is a strong evidence base and rationale for Traveller accommodation to be taken out of the hands of local authorities.<\/p><p> I am not sure if members of the committee are aware that today is International Children's Day.  I mention it in light of the recent report of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in regard to Spring Lane, which highlighted the appalling and deplorable conditions in which families have been forced to live for many years.  Let there be no mistake about it, as stated by my colleagues, that is not an isolated incident.  What is happening at Spring Lane is prevalent throughout the country.  In almost every county in Ireland there are families living in similar conditions.  It is shameful and shocking.  As a Traveller man, I do not become desensitised to it.  It is appalling and shocking.  It is shameful and an indictment on society that we allow this situation to continue.  I need to be frank.  The State and all of its institutions by their inaction have been complicit in allowing this situation to prevail.  I call on the policymakers, the decisionmakers and legislators to work with the Traveller organisations to develop a new approach to an old problem.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  We have been trying the same approach for more than 30 years with the same result, that is, Travellers being let down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Collins.

I will focus my first remarks on what Mr. Collins had to say.  I empathise with him.  I have a reasonable amount of experience of how local authorities deal with the Traveller community.  I was previously mayor of Kerry and I was a councillor in Kerry for 22 years.  There are two sides to every story.  There have been very few occasions in Kerry where members of the Traveller community were guilty of antisocial behaviour, but members of the non-Traveller community are also guilty of antisocial behaviour.  The town of Listowel, where I come from, has a good record and a long settled Traveller community.  We work well together and everything is fine.<\/p> <p>  When I was mayor of Kerry, a number of people objected to Travellers being housed in a particular estate.  They were vehement and there were many public meetings called.  As Mr. Collins mentioned, we all have to be elected.  To give credit where it is due, the officials of the council and I, as mayor, faced down those objections.  I still have some of the letters of abuse I received, which would cause the hairs on your head to stand.  The people who were allocated the houses are some of the most exemplary tenants Kerry County Council has ever had.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that some councils are not playing their part or taking up the budgets allocated to them.<\/p><p>Would Mr. Collins, the clerk to the committee or the Department be able to furnish me and the other members with statistics as to how much of the budget each county council took up, not just this year or last year but maybe even over a five-year or ten-year period, in order that we could make a league table out of the statistics?  If councils are not playing their part, they must be outed.<\/p><p> We could talk about this all day long.  There is loads more I would love to say to the other members and to Mr. Collins but I have to conclude.

Again, it points in one direction: the shocking failure of the State.  Something I forgot to mention, which puts this into context, is that, in 2012, the Department with responsibility for housing did a piece of research, to which I think Ms Kelly alluded, which found that one in ten Travellers, effectively 13.5% of Travellers, was homeless.  Using the census figures of 2016, that is the equivalent of 657,139 people in the majority population without a home.  That puts it into context.  If that does not constitute a humanitarian crisis, I do not know what does.  If there were 657,139 people homeless in the settled community, that would be declared a national emergency, yet when it happens to our community, it does not get the same status or acknowledgement.  It is dismissed, in fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Would any of the other witnesses like to make any comments in reply to Senator O'Sullivan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#E00800","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Yes, I would.

It highlights the reality of Traveller-specific accommodation delivery across the country and brings us back to the reality that we need to bypass the Part 8 stage so we can alleviate this issue and take away that pressure on and abuse of local representatives.  It is unfair that they get that but, most importantly, it is unfair that Traveller children are left in inhumane conditions for decades.

There is antisocial behaviour within every community in Ireland but it is only Travellers who are penalised as a majority and it is only Traveller children who are not afforded their rights because some members of the community engage in antisocial behaviour.  It is very concerning that the matter is even brought into the conversation because a minority of people engaging in antisocial behaviour should not lead to or justify the oppression of 40,000 Travellers, which is, as Mr. Collins rightly points out, a humanitarian crisis but not acknowledged as such.

I have faced many times a lot of the issues Mr. Collins mentioned, such as dealing with councillors and councils in respect of their attitude and their delivery.  Local authorities that do not deliver should be penalised and there should be someone to oversee them.  Taking this out of the hands of the local authorities could be a bad step, but we could have someone overseeing the local authorities and persistently hounding them to do the right thing and to live up to their budgets.  Time out of number we have seen budgets falling behind and not being used, Traveller accommodation getting worse and the number of people looking for accommodation increasing significantly.  In Dublin North-West the number of people in the Traveller community looking for accommodation is huge.  There is no way anyone should be thinking of evictions in this climate for starters.  There should not be evictions, full stop.  They should be the very last resort, whether in the settled community or in the Traveller community.  In this climate, however, there is no way they should be allowed.<\/p> <p>  As for depoliticising the issues faced by the Traveller community, we need to politicise people.  We need to get to people with attitudes against either Travellers or other races.  We need to change that mindset.  We have to get at these politicians and get them to understand that this is totally and utterly unacceptable.  We watch football matches now and see people kneeling down over racism.  We should have a similar attitude towards the Traveller community and any other community that is being treated in a different way or abused in any way.  It has to be unacceptable and we need to push the agenda that it is not acceptable and never will be.<\/p> <p>  For years I have been dealing with Traveller families and I have, I hope, a very good relationship with the vast majority.  On Ratoath Road there is the Gavan family: 15 people and no running water.  They are getting water brought in in tanks.  There is no other supply.  There are other issues there.  In fairness to Celine Burke, she has been delivering water there for the past month or so but the family have no running water.  This goes back to what Ms Maughan said about running water.  It is essential.  There are animals, families, men, women and children on these sites.  Nearly every person on that site got Covid, yet I am after lobbying every person I can think of, including the Minister, to try to get running water in there.<\/p><p>That shows the way people are being treated.  It is unacceptable.  It has to stop.  We must speak out, as people, and make our views known that we do not accept it.  I do not stand in the company of anyone who talks racism.  I tell them straight that I have no time for it.  The same goes for anyone who runs down any other community.  I will not stand for it.  That is the way we should be.

We are fully in agreement with Ms Kelly's points.  Deputy Ellis talked about accountability.  As Ms Kelly stated, it goes back to the expert review recommendations.  One of the key recommendations in terms of governance is the establishment of a national Traveller accommodation authority to oversee the monitoring and delivery of the Traveller accommodation programmes.  Each local authority draws up a Traveller accommodation plan every five years.  When the plans were published in 2019, the Irish Traveller Movement did a large-scale audit of those 31 Traveller accommodation programmes.  A few key themes emerged from the audit, including the inconsistent approach across the different local authorities, how the data were represented and how the need was established.  Other themes included the lack of delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation, which has been referenced, and a lack of planning for future need.<\/p> <p>  The Traveller population is extremely young, with over 60% aged under 25.  Travellers also tend to get married at a younger age.  When future need is not included in the Traveller accommodation programmes, it causes the homelessness figures to continue to rise.  That is all very clearly set out in the Traveller accommodation programmes.  If we had a national Traveller accommodation authority to oversee how those plans were drawn up and delivered, it would make a huge difference.  In terms of that delivery, if a pipeline report was published each year to enable us to know what plans were in place for Traveller accommodation for the year, it would provide an extra layer of accountability.  That is something that would be easy to put in place.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the issue of evictions.  It is a huge issue.  As Mr. Collins referenced, we are still in breach of Article 16 of the European Social Charter in relation to our eviction procedures for Travellers.  It concerns how evictions take place under the criminal trespass legislation, the criminalisation of nomadism as a cultural practice and the fact that there is no national register of evictions.  We do not know how many evictions of Travellers take place every year, aside from the continued interventions that we and other organisations such as the Free Legal Advice Centres have to make for families in those situations.  As the expert review states, it is most important that we repeal the criminal trespass legislation, put the national register in place and include eviction procedures.  There was no protection for Travellers in the second eviction ban.  That should be reinstated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Murtagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I agree with both Ms Kelly and Ms Murtagh in all of the information that they have forwarded to members of the committee.  The reality for us is that there has been a lack of accountability for decades.  The only way that we are going to ensure that there is accountability for Traveller children in Ireland is to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes.  We must ensure, as Traveller organisations, Senators, local councillors and Deputies, that we do not feed into the same system that has failed Travellers, generation after generation.  I believe and feel that there is a change in the tide in that more people in Ireland and within the political system are saying that it is unacceptable.  We need to be vocal.  However, just being vocal is not good enough.  We need to see action.<\/p> <p>  In this case, Traveller children need to see accountability.  The only way they are going to have that accountability and are no longer going to have their human rights violated is to see the establishment of a national Traveller accommodation authority to oversee the implementation of the 32 recommendations of the expert group report.  Funds for that must also be ring-fenced so that the group can set out to complete the task at hand.  If it is not fully resourced, it will not be able to implement the 32 recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I wholeheartedly agree that local authorities that continue to fail to deliver Traveller accommodation plan after Traveller accommodation plan deserve to be sanctioned.  They deserved to be sanctioned a long time ago because Travellers have been suffering the trauma of their failures.  We need to end that.  I and the Irish Traveller movement believe that there would be no need for sanctions if the national Traveller accommodation authority was in place and invested in sufficiently, because local authorities would be held to account and would implement their Traveller accommodation programmes.  If there was a robust review system within the Traveller accommodation programmes, whereby there was a midterm review of each programme with timelines, targets and outputs, it would be easily monitored and the failure of local authorities would be caught in time.  Traveller children need that level of accountability.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Collins said, members of this committee and the representatives of Traveller organisations present here today are once more saying the same thing that we have been saying for 30 years.  We need to be listened to, finally.  We need other players to join us in our quest for equality.  If every local Traveller organisation contacted the Ombudsman for Children's Office, there would be a similar result for each county in Ireland.  That is a scandalous shame for a country of our status in 2021.  We have to let Traveller children know that they matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms RoseMarie Maughan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I wish to echo the points made earlier around congratulations.  It is fantastic in one way to be sitting here with a Traveller chairing this committee.  It is historic and the more it happens across other committees, the better.  Well done, Chairman, you are playing a blinder.<\/p> <p>  It is unfortunate that we are before this committee again saying exactly the same things we have been saying for decades.  Implementation and action are needed.  As has already been said, it was not today or yesterday when we learned of these issues or became aware of them.  For too long the State has known its failure in the context of Travellers and accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased the issue of the burden of racism was raised because the inaction and lack of implementation are underpinned by institutional racism.  This problem has utterly failed Travellers living in inhumane conditions.<\/p> <p>  The report of the Ombudsman for Children is damning.  It sets out starkly the conditions in which Traveller children and their parents are living in this country.  However, it is not the first report on Spring Lane.  In January 2019, a Council of Europe committee upheld a collective complaint about Spring Lane that outlined the conditions that the families, including children, are living in there.  That was two and a half years ago.  Absolutely nothing has happened in the interim apart from conditions getting worse.  Unfortunately, as has already been said, this is the experience of thousands of Travellers living in other substandard and appalling conditions in Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p> <p>  We need to remind ourselves that poor and substandard accommodation has a major impact on all aspects of our lives, including health and education.  We are already looking at acute disadvantage in education for Traveller children and they experience inequality in terms of access, participation and outcomes.  Accommodation has a major bearing on this, as is clear from the testimony of children in the report of the ombudsman.  The children are on the back foot from the get-go in walking out to school from where they live covered in mud.  The impact on children is similar across the board.  It is right that noise is being made.  It is right that there is criticism of the conditions and what people have to live with in Spring Lane.  What is more important is the action that is needed to follow through from that.  Unfortunately, we have not seen that despite the same kinds of issues being flagged time and again.  Let us hope for the families in Spring Lane and the thousands of Travellers living in these conditions elsewhere not only that noise is made but that it has an impact on the lived lives of people and Travellers living in these conditions throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  All this means there has to be action by the State.  It has already been spoken about but Part 8 needs to be suspended.  It is a significant barrier.  We are already seeing it in courts at the moment in respect of one area in the country.  The problem is the threat of the mechanism, how it is used and the way in which elected officials act.  They are part of local authority accommodation consultative committees and are supposedly working in partnership with Travellers throughout the country to address accommodation issues.  On the one hand we say let the plan for the Traveller accommodation programme go through but on the other hand we know it will not get past Part 8.  That is no way for what is supposed to be a partnership approach to work.  There is abject failure by local authorities with regard to Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The removal of trespass legislation from the Statute Book is essential given the impact it has had on Traveller nomadism.  In conjunction with that we need an absolute moratorium on convictions in the context of Traveller needs.  That can only happen if the State takes the current situation as it is in the context of decades of failure in addressing Traveller accommodation.  We should not be sitting before this committee again and, unfortunately, it is frustrating to think that we probably will be sitting before the committee again naming the same issues we have named many times because the State and local authorities have failed to act in a way that will deliver for Travellers with regard to accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Mr. Collins, do you wish to come in briefly?

I will make three quick points in respect of Spring Lane and the shocking images and findings of the report of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  I wish to cast the minds of people back.  We were here before in October 2015 with the terrible tragedy in Carrickmines, where ten members of our community lost their lives.  I remember in the aftermath of that terrible tragedy politicians and others came out with rhetoric to the effect that it represented a line in the sand and a watershed moment in terms of relations between Travellers and settled people and accommodation provision.  Of course, within a week, as my colleagues and others have said, we went from lip service to baubles.  We have been here before with the terrible tragedy in Carrickmines and we did not see any change or any significant change coming about as a result of that terrible tragedy.  Going back to a point made earlier on, I maintain that the State was complicit in that tragedy because families were left in squalor and deprivation with no services, facilities or water hoses, etc.  That is why I maintain the State was complicit in that terrible tragedy.<\/p> <p>  After that terrible tragedy the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage embarked on a programme of giving some Travellers on sites a carbon monoxide alarm, a fire alarm and a little hose or a fire blanket here or there.  They were giving these gadgets to people on sites that were structurally unsafe to live in.  The sites needed to be demolished and reconstructed, but that did not happen.  We got little gadgets to put in the trailers.  It was absurd and beyond ridiculous.<\/p> <p>  The last point is not only relevant for Spring Lane but I will use the site as an example.  I will ask a question about the chief executive of Cork City Council.  Was that person ever at the Spring Lane site?  We have 30-odd chief executives throughout the country.  How many of them have been on sites to look at the conditions that people have to endure on a daily basis?  I suspect the answer is few, if any, have actually been on a site.  As a result, they are completely distant and desensitised.  They are living in ivory towers.  What about the staff in the accommodation units?  Few of them go on to sites to meet Travellers.  Travellers have to go into their buildings to make the case for accommodation.  These people need to get out of their ivory towers, come on to sites and see the reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I agree 100% with everything that has been said.  I will provide a note of information for people.  In our next public meeting, we will have the Ombudsman for Children in to discuss the report.  That will be a tough report for us to listen to.  As Mr. Collins said, it is the case even today even for those reared in other halting sites.  It is no different for Travellers in the likes of Labre Park and Cabra Park and so on and for children in those places.  My thanks to Mr. Collins for that.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps we could move a little.

One of the things that we see now is that it is easy enough to get people to back legislation but it is not as easy to get them to make sure it is implemented.<\/p> <p>  As has been well outlined here today, the simple fact is that permanent, transient or Traveller-specific housing is not being provided.  What I find fascinating when people do not want things is that they never oppose the thing in principle.  They always say that the site is not suitable, that it is not the appropriate time or something else is not appropriate and that it is really for the good of the people that they are opposing whatever they opposing.  The reality is that there is no worthwhile accommodation being provided for Travellers, certainly in the city of Galway, although the county is better, and any time one tries to get a Part 8 it seems to run into the sand.  As has been pointed out, the CEOs do not overrule the councils.  The CEOs have emergency powers to do so but are just not doing so.  Not only are the councils not fulfilling their duty, they are thumbing their nose at the Oireachtas, at the law, and at their moral obligations as are the CEOs, effectively, by not swiftly overruling when there is inaction.<\/p> <p>  As a politician, as a democrat and as somebody who believes in the democratic process, I believe in accountability.  I am normally very opposed to taking powers away from politicians and giving them to unelected bodies because it undermines democracy but in this case it is the politicians who have undermined democracy as they have not fulfilled their duties, legally or practically.  It is time for us when we come to write our report to be very forceful about what we want.  Not forceful in words by saying this and that should happen, but we must propose firm action that will make things happen and ensure things happen.  Whether that is the Housing Agency, An Bord Plean&aacute;la or whatever mechanism one might look at, it has to happen and happen immediately.<\/p> <p>  The issue of anti-social behaviour has been brought up.  I am fed up telling people that anti-social behaviour in many places has nothing to do with Travellers.  Anti-social behaviour occurs in society.  What we know also, and what everybody who has an sociological understanding knows, is the more people have a stake in society and the better people are treated then the more likely they are to conform to the norms of society.  That is a well known catch-22 that has been well articulated by M&iacute;che&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il in the latest version of his books on prejudice, which had a chapter dedicated to the Traveller community.  Chapter 13 of the book is entitled, The Travelling People - Ireland's Apartheid.  He was bang on the button.  The answer to that problem also, funnily enough, is that the settled society must start acting and fulfilling its obligation so that as everybody truly feels equal then everybody will truly feel they have a stake in society.  We know that is a reality right across the world.<\/p> <p>  I hate it when somebody says we must depoliticise this issue.  We actually must politicise this issue because if we depoliticise things then what generally happens is that people slap each other on the back and congratulate themselves for being great people and that there is no racism in Irish society.  My worry is that we are becoming much more openly intolerant than we were not only in terms of Travellers but other minorities.  I worry that it has become acceptable in places for people to stand up and be quite intolerant about things.<\/p> <p>  This should become a political issue and particularly at election time.  If all the Travellers voted in Galway, where people would support their rights, many people would be queuing to change their mind because there is a sizeable vote in it.  One might think that a block of 500 or 1,000 votes is small but anybody who has ever fought a proportional representation or PR election knows that it is awfully easy to be hanging in there on the last day not waiting for a 1,000 votes but waiting for 500, 300, 200 or 20 votes.  It is time that the Traveller community became much more politicised and judged us all on our actions not on promises made before elections.<\/p> <p>  I have a little saying in Galway, in that if somebody presented a petition at an election time looking for a bridge to be built from Connemara to America, even though that will never happen, people would sign up for it.  What I am saying is that people must be measured by their actual actions on this issue.  I look forward to us sitting down over the next month and a bit to put together a strong but forceful programme of work that will have things that will be unpalatable for some politicians.  That will be a political issue as it should be.  Then we should push our case that the Oireachtas would enact strong legislation and make something happen to deal with the absolutely disgraceful accommodation that we have all over the place.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier at another meeting, non-compliance with the law frightens me as well as how local authorities and other agencies connive in not following the law.  There seems to be no comeback.  A law where there is no penalty is not a law.  A law that says a local authority should do something yet there is no comeback when it does not is not a law but a wish.  The idea of a law is that there is something one must do and provide but if one does not do so, then there is a penalty.  We pass too many laws in this place that wish a lot of things but do not seem to have any penalty at the end of the day if the people who are obliged to do something do not do it.  We need teeth in this.<\/p> <p>  I do not need much detail because I know there are other speakers, including Deputy Collins, who want to get in.  Perhaps the witnesses can answer the Deputy's and my questions together, if the Chair agrees, to maximise the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#H00100","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#H00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Yes, that is great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#H00300","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>It is great to see the witnesses again.  I know where they are coming from when they say that they should not be here and we should not be in this situation.  One can really hear the frustration and righteous anger felt by the Traveller and Roma communities from the point of view of the way human rights have not been upheld.<\/p> <p>  We must ensure that the independent national Traveller accommodation authority is set up.  We must ensure that it conducts quarterly reviews or whatever and plans exactly what needs to be done.  This is the only area where we are not calling for money to be invested as the money is there but it has not been spent because of racist attitudes, which are wrong.  We must call that out and align a few things together.  I agree with the call to repeal criminal trespass legislation but it must be done in tandem with accommodation being built.  I suggest that so we will not have a situation where accommodation is not being built, the law is repealed and families go on to the sites but the law is used against families and communities as the sites are not secured for living conditions.  All of these things must be done together so that when people find themselves in an overcrowded situation on a site that there is somewhere for them to go.  This comes down to all the issues that relate to evictions both within the Traveller community and general population.  No one should be evicted until there is somewhere for him or her to go and if there is a problem, then that must be addressed on the site or wherever.<\/p><p> That is my opinion on the matter.  We need to get it right this time because if we do not, there will be not just righteous anger but also anger that will be spread elsewhere in regard to how the communities have been treated.  One issue we have to factor in, and it will not stop us from doing the job we have to do, relates to the racist, fascist-type movements that are building in communities and trying to get a foothold in working-class communities.  Accommodation is a human right for everybody and we should not all be fighting for the crumbs from the table.  Social housing should be provided for the general population and there should be specific accommodation for the Traveller and Roma communities.<\/p><p> I hope that what we in the committee can pull together will enhance what our guests want to do.  The legislation has to be there and there will have to be penalties and so on.  The issue is so frustrating.  The Chairman mentioned Labre Park, the site of which the council was supposed to reconstruct four years ago.  Again and again, however, barriers are put up and there is another excuse not to go ahead with it.  Inspections are carried out, health and safety reports are prepared and so on.  We get new plans all the time and it just kicks the can down the road from the point of view of dealing with the issue on the site.<\/p><p> I read recently that it was ten years ago that Cork City Council presented councillors with a proposal to rezone the land in Spring Lane to extend the chronically overcrowded halting site.  A HSE report on the conditions on the site, in regard to the sewerage and so on, was produced in 2012.  This has been going on and on.  We have to say \"stop\".  It is time for action and we have to implement it.  We have to find a way to cut across not only the racism that exists but also the undercurrent that is there.  I do not know exactly how we can do that.  I do not know whether there should be ad campaigns depicting the conditions the Travelling community is living in.  Our guests and their movements have to make that decision because, as they have always said, there should be nothing about them without them.<\/p><p> How can we communicate to the general population that this needs to change and that it is just not acceptable?  We cannot accept that kids live in the conditions they do, not because of what they do themselves but because of the non-action of State bodies.  I hope we can pull together something strong from this committee to support the communities in every way we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#H00400","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I agree 100%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#J00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Collins for the points they made in respect of Traveller accommodation.  To follow on from what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, there has been report after report and much research has been carried out in regard to Traveller accommodation.  The Traveller community is one of the most over-analysed and researched communities in the context of accommodation.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v noted, there is no point in producing these reports and research if we are not going to see action.  I acknowledge that the report on Spring Lane has just been released, as was mentioned, but unfortunately this is just one example of what is happening throughout the country.  We have seen it at first hand, as Traveller representatives.  We have been on the ground and seen the conditions that families are living in.  This needs to be addressed because it is having a detrimental impact on the community, both mentally and as a breach of human rights, as I said earlier.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised the issue of legislation and made a good point when he asked what the point of having legislation is if there is no accountability or sanctions.  It is not worth the paper it is written on.  The other representatives before the committee and I believe the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 needs to be strengthened such that all local authorities that do not meet their legal obligations in regard to the delivery of Traveller accommodation plans need to be held to account and sanctions put in place.  Our community on the ground is sick to the teeth of being left behind when it comes to accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the issue of voting.  More Travellers need to vote and great work has been done, both locally and nationally, to encourage our community to vote, which is key.  Our community has been let down so often by local authorities.  They are disheartened and powerless and they ask what the point in voting is because it will not make any change.

That is an important point and it was one recommendation of the expert review, as was circumventing the Part 8 process.  Another piece in that puzzle of national accountability relates to ensuring that Traveller-specific accommodation will be included in the Land Development Agency Bill 2021.  Amendments have been put forward to ensure that land designated for Traveller-specific culturally appropriate accommodation will be included in that Bill.  It is so important that those amendments pass.  It raises the question of why those provisions were not included in the original text of the Bill and why Traveller organisations and allies have to work so hard to have them included.<\/p> <p>  The issue of funding was raised.  It is true that there is a budget for Traveller-specific accommodation to be built every year, which last year amounted to &euro;14.5 million.  Nevertheless, there also needs to be resourcing for the expert review.  In the context of the programme board that has been put in place, there are project groups, extensive consultation processes are ongoing and the Traveller accommodation support unit is carrying out vital work.

I know from their work that they are not just expressions and they are committed to promoting Traveller rights and the implementation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998.  I return to something Mr. Collins raised, namely, the Carrickmines tragedy, when we needlessly lost ten people and an unborn baby due to State failures having left them in inhumane, unsafe conditions.  The reality for Travellers today is that it remains a possibility that such a tragedy could happen again, but we must ensure that it never does.  The only way in which we can do that is through accountability, and that theme is coming across strongly from all Travellers at this meeting.  We need members' support to ensure there will be accountability and our lives will be valid and equal to theirs.  It should no longer be acceptable within Irish society, our homeland, for us to be expected to live in inhumane conditions that endanger our lives.<\/p> <p>  Our statistics speak for themselves.  As Ms Kelly noted, we are the most heavily researched and analysed community in the country.  We do not need more research or empty promises.<\/p><p>We need action.  We need true, active allies by our side, morning, noon and night, even when we are not in the room, otherwise nothing will change and, as Ms Joyce said, we will be back here again with broken hearts and children still living in inhumane conditions, saying the same thing that other Travellers who are now dead, God rest them, said 30 years ago.

I wholeheartedly commend him on his work in acknowledging that Part 8 should be bypassed for Travellers.  It is a stain on the nation when local authorities can be heard to say that they will let it go through Part 8 because they know it will never pass.  Behind that, young Traveller children are left in inhumane conditions.  That has to end.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Joan Collins that we need to repeal the trespassing legislation alongside the implementation of Traveller-specific accommodation.  We focused on inhumane conditions today and did not focus enough on what has happened to Travellers.  As a nomadic people, we cannot travel.  Instead, we are punished and criminalised for being nomadic people.  That has resulted in a cultural genocide by our State.  That must be acknowledged and reversed.  The recognition of Traveller ethnicity on 1 March 2017 has to mean something for Traveller children and every Traveller who has lost a key part of their culture and identity.  Ireland has to say that enough is enough.  We cannot be expected to be resilient for all our lives and never see a day of equality.  I want to be equal before I die, like all other Travellers here today, and the committee can help to make that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms RoseMarie Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I know some members have committees to go to.  I welcome the points made by Deputies &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Joan Collins about proposing firm action from this committee.  Action is needed.  There is a link to the Oireachtas and a need for legislative responses.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right that more than one convention centre could be filled with all the strategies and reports on Travellers, all containing damning indictments of the conditions that Travellers are living in, across accommodation, education, health, employment and a number of areas.  Today's focus is accommodation.  Strategies and plans are not being delivered on, which is the crucial problem, because there is no accountability, sanctions or follow-through when they are not delivered.  I welcome Deputy Collins's points about how this has been framed and how Travellers have called for it for decades.<\/p> <p>  This is about the most basic rights but it is important that it is framed in the context of human rights.  People do not have basic services like water, sanitation and toilet provision.  It is a violation at the most basic levels when people are living in these conditions and those needs are not being met.  The context of rights and that framework is crucial.  Either Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v or Deputy Collins said that there have been too many excuses for too long now, with the can being kicked down the road.  This is too often the reality with Traveller accommodation.  It is not good enough to have condemnation and criticism when these reports emerge despite the fact that Travellers and Traveller organisations have long been noting these issues and have met walls blocking progress because there is no political fallout, accountability, or consequences for local authorities and elected officials with regard to the non-delivery of Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Action and implementation are critical and are needed.  I was speaking to number of local Traveller organisations in Cork last week.  One said that it is an awful indictment of ourselves that we have to say that we welcome this kind of report, but welcome it we did.  She also acknowledged the bravery of the Ombudsman in going to the lengths that he did in the report.  We need those kinds of clear recommendations and clear action that will lead to consequences for local authorities and the State when there is non-delivery.<\/p> <p>  There have not been many bright spots in Covid-19, if any at all, but it has shown that where there is a will, there is a way.  Where some local authorities acted, they could deliver.  It was not nearly enough.  As one delegate said earlier, it took Covid to make the most basic provision like water or sanitation available.  Things can be made to happen where there is that political will.  Covid has shown that things can happen right across Irish society and that lesson needs to be emphasised.  That is all that we are asking for.  We are not asking for anything magical or new.  We are asking for an acceptance of viewing Traveller accommodation from a human rights perspective that responds to the community, its needs, and its ethnicity.  While new legislation is important, in the context of recognising Travellers as an ethnic minority, it is also important that we dismantle legislation that is contradictory to the way of life, ethnic status, and the community.  That includes the trespassing legislation.  I do not want to wait until other things are in place to make that to happen.  I want legislation that impacts in a disproportionate and negative way on Travellers to be dismantled in tandem with the conditions being created so that we will not be back here at any time in the future saying the same things over and over again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Unfortunately Senator Moynihan had to go to another meeting and sends her apologies.  It has been difficult for me as a member of the Traveller community to chair some of the meetings of this committee because of how sometimes our language is not always appropriate or how we speak about \"them\" and \"us\", the normal community and the Traveller community.  We see it often and it is no different here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ms Maughan is right that there is not 100% of the necessary political will but there has been a shift in the political way of thinking and engaging with members of the Traveller community.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the suggestion that Travellers do not vote, a majority of the Traveller community vote and have voted for many years.  It is up to local authorities to go into halting sites to engage with members of the Traveller community.<\/p><p>I hope with all my heart that it does so, as a 31-year-old woman who has worked since the age of 18 years and who has sat on local consultative committees where local authorities speak about us and say we are the problem in society.  We are not the problem.  We are not looking for special treatment; we are looking for basic human rights.<\/p><p> People in the community are sick of audits being done on sites.  Carrickmines is, unfortunately, being used as an excuse for more evictions, for saying caravans have to be 6 m apart and for other nonsense that stops Travellers being able to live with our families and on halting sites.  Since Carrickmines, more barriers have been put up around Traveller accommodation.  Nothing has got better.<\/p><p> I remember that day in 2015.  I thought it had taken ten people to die and this might change stuff for the Traveller community around accommodation.  Unfortunately, it has not.  At the report last week I cried, as a young woman who grew up in Labre Park.  Still today, there is no park for the children to play in or proper facilities for children there.  As a woman who grew up in those conditions and now has my own children, I do not want that for Traveller children.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, the State and the local authorities have a responsibility.<\/p><p> We are nowhere near reaching the sustainable development goals at a European level.  Recently, there was an outbreak of hepatitis A.  We do not see hepatitis A in Ireland today but it is acceptable to see it in the Traveller community and among Traveller children on halting sites.  As a Traveller woman who fought hard to get in here, I hope with all my heart that Ms Maria Joyce, Mr. Collins, Ms Maughan, Mr. Bernard Joyce and other representatives of our community will not be sitting here in a few years blue in the face having these discussions again.<\/p><p> There is policy after policy, legislation after legislation and no implementation.  We have the answers.  Travellers came up with the answers.  All we are looking for is implementation.  I know people on this committee and I have worked closely with them.  I hope the committee will achieve these actions for our community as a whole so we do not see any more tragedies like Carrickmines or horrible but welcome reports from the Government, the State and local authorities.  It may be sexy to vote for the councillor who does not like Travellers and says they will push out the Travellers.  It is up to us to hold councillors to account and say we do not accept racism in Ireland today.  Nothing about us without us.  Travellers are Ireland&rsquo;s own and we have always belonged in Ireland. <\/p><p> Notwithstanding the Proclamation, young children in Ireland are still growing up in dire circumstances and we are not treating Traveller children as equal.  It seems that all the children of our nation should be treated equally, but not Traveller children.  We need to look at that.  As a committee, we have a responsibility.  I know members of this committee are fully committed to making sure we have action this time around.  Let us not recreate the wheel.  Those 32 recommendations are already there.  The work has already been done.  The easy part should be implementation, drawing down the money and making sure people will not have to put up with horrible living conditions and be blamed for it.<\/p><p> I am conscious that I am the Chairperson of the committee and I do not want to go on and on, but all that needs to be done is implementation.  The work is already done.<\/p><p> I see Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly has come in.  If he would like to make a comment, he is welcome to do so.

The conditions of the children in Spring Lane which were spoken about in terms of their lived experience are similarly substandard to those of many Traveller children across the country.  If those shoes were being walked in by the majority population that are walked in by Traveller children and Travellers, the failure by this State would not have held the way it has in the context of Traveller accommodation through the decades.  That is the sad reality.<\/p> <p>  We can keep talking but what is needed now is action.  The stories those children told are those that every Traveller child in substandard accommodation and homelessness could tell.  If that was experienced by the people who can make a difference and make the delivery happen, it would not have gone on and the State would not have continued to fail Traveller children.  There is an onus on the report coming from this committee to reinforce those points, which I think it will, with regard to implementation and action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622502000,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Following on from what Ms Joyce said, it is unacceptable in 2021 that we still have families in deplorable conditions.

I thank the committee and the Chair for the opportunity.  I am hopeful from today's session, hearing the commitment of the Chair and other members, that it is time for real action, which means accountability and implementation.  A key priority that came across today was the need for a national Traveller accommodation authority, which would ensure that the 32 recommendations needed to save Traveller lives are implemented and that our culturally appropriate accommodation needs are met.<\/p><p>It is no longer good enough to develop policy after policy following decades of forced assimilation attempts.  As the Chair stated, Travellers have come with the answers.  We have been coming with the answers and solutions for decades but have not had the opportunity to be listened to equally.  I hope I am hearing that we are being listened to today and have allies who are willing to push our agenda with us, not for us.  <\/p><p> I also remind people about the bypassing of Part 8, an issue which came across strongly today.  It is meant to be an element of the State that serves the purpose of democracy but, unfortunately, for Travellers there is no democracy when Traveller-specific accommodation is being blocked decade after decade, and poor Traveller children and families are forced to live without the basics such as water.  <\/p><p> I ask for the repeal of the trespass Act, which criminalises travellers for being themselves and for being born into an ethnic minority group.  As I mentioned, this Act has resulted in cultural genocide.  On the one hand, we are evicted from pillar to post for trying to be ourselves and for being nomadic, while, on the other, local authorities and the State fail to provide transient sites.  Instead of investing resources into delivery of transient accommodation, they invest our resources into evictions of vulnerable families.  That is not the way a country that prides itself on human rights acts and behaves in a just society.<\/p><p> To sum up, we have to be the generation that ends Traveller oppression and acknowledges 11% of our deaths by suicide are due to institutional racism and the way we have been treated.  That is the impact of our lived trauma and not being treated as the equals we are.  I look forward to working with the committee to ensure the human rights of Traveller children are no longer breached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021060100002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms RoseMarie Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622502000,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Maughan.
