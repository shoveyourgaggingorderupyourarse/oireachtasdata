Unfortunately, to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive engagement.  The absence of the Executive also means that that North South Ministerial Council cannot meet.<\/p>  <p>  I am currently engaging with the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley on how both Governments can most effectively secure the effective operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  In the period ahead, I believe a new political process is required to get beyond the current impasse and secure the necessary agreement between the parties on operating the devolved institutions again.  I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving that, but I firmly believe that a resolution is possible and that the calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate will be heeded.<\/p>  <p>  A meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference took place on 25 July to discuss issues of mutual interest to the Irish and British Governments, in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement.  The conference discussed legacy issues, security co-operation, east-west bilateral issues and political stability in Northern Ireland.  A date for the next meeting of the conference is currently being considered.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the UK decision to leave the European Union, the Government is determined to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the gains and benefits of the peace process, are protected for people on the island of Ireland, North and South.  The Government appreciates the solidarity and support which has been shown by all of our EU partners in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns and is continuing to engage intensively in the article 50 process, to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of outstanding commitments, the Government continues to support a statutory basis for the Irish language in Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the St Andrews Agreement.  Respect for linguistic diversity and the Irish language are important elements of the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  As reflected in the programme for partnership Government, the Government also remains supportive of, and continues to advocate for, the advancement of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  The continued value of a bill of rights in the context of Brexit was one of the themes which emerged from the all island civic dialogue sectoral on human rights under the Good Friday Agreement which the Government convened in February 2017.<\/p>  <p>  A North South consultative forum is a further important outstanding element envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement, and the Government has continued to pursue this, including by maintaining the issue on the North South Ministerial Council in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Government views as a solemn responsibility our role and mandate as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We will spare no effort to fulfil our duty as co-guarantor, including to seek the effective operation of all of its institutions, ensure that the agreement is protected in the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, and working for the implementation of outstanding commitments.  The Government will continue this work, in co-operation with the British Government and engaging with all of the political parties in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600056#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600056#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[42250\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600056#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the estimated ODA\/GNI target in view of budget 2019 and the increased allocation to overseas development aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>The Government is strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s international development assistance programme and to its place at the heart of foreign policy.

Over 20% of total passport applications for 2017 came from these jurisdictions with more than 82,000 applications being received from Northern Ireland and almost 81,000 from Great Britain.

This expanded presence will extend our support to Irish businesses in search of new markets. <\/p>  <p>  That&rsquo;s why we will be opening offices in Mumbai, Frankfurt and LA, and new embassies in Chile and Colombia in 2019.

The Report contains an Action Plan, setting out the agreed timelines for implementation, and also a commitment that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The Working Group has published six such updates to date, most recently on 30 August.  It shows that, in total, of the 56 separate applicable deadlines within the Action Plan set to the end of Q2 2018, 44 relate to actions which have now been completed. Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  Officials in the Department of Finance are now working to collate the progress updates for the Seventh Progress Update Report and it is expected that this work will be finalised in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for September 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by almost 22% since peaking in July 2016.  I appreciate that these figures represent a broad average however we have to recognise that these are the same figures that showed the large increase that many commentators regularly reference.  Therefore, I think it has to be recognised that the overall trend currently is downward, which is  to be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600058#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600058#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[42242\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600058#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if and when a refund of income tax will be made in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":172,"content":"<p>As I noted in my response of Question 29262-18, Revenue wrote to the person in question requesting a number of clarifications.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that it has not yet received any reply from the person, including in respect of a reminder letter that recently issued to them.

The objective of the Scheme is to allow participating schools to seek to achieve Gaeltacht School Recognition over a 5 year period on the basis of the implementation of specific language-based criteria, including the implementation of a total-immersion approach and the development of action plans by schools.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2017, all primary and post-primary schools in Gaeltacht language-planning areas were invited to participate in the Scheme. The Scheme has been welcomed by Gaeltacht communities and well-received in Gaeltacht schools. This is evident from the high participation rates in the Scheme. 106 or 80% of primary schools and 28 or 96% of post-primary schools in the Gaeltacht have opted to participate in the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  To encourage participation in the Scheme by schools, a comprehensive information pack outlining the benefits of immersion education and bilingualism was sent to schools for dissemination to school communities, including parents and teachers. The information pack was developed by the Gaeltacht Education Unit in my Department in collaboration with An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG), Gaeloideachas, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. <\/p>  <p>  Following the submission and review of each participating school&rsquo;s action plans for improvement by An tAonad um Oideachas Gaeltachta, schools participating in the Scheme were eligible to access a number of additional resources from September 2018. These resources include access to a grant to purchase Irish-medium teaching resources, additional language teaching hours, additional continuing professional development delivered by COGG and additional Inspectorate support.<\/p>  <p>  The number of additional language support hours allocated to schools participating in the Scheme from September 2018 was based on the enrolment figures recorded in the previous year, which is in line with Department norms. Schools at primary level were given the option to combine their additional language support hours with other schools to form clusters, which would allow for the creation of a temporary part-time teaching post that would be shared by the schools in the cluster. Initially schools were advised that the combined hours must equal 25 hours to create the shared teaching post, however, a number of schools applied to form clusters with a combined total of less than 25 hours. Having reviewed all applications received on a case by case basis my Department made the decision to approve these clusters also. This decision was made in the context of the challenges relating to the recruitment of teachers by schools in remote Gaeltacht areas and in the interests of the implementation of the Scheme and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education in general. <\/p>  <p>  Circular 0021\/2018 also highlights that the allocation of additional language support hours will be reviewed in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600059#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600059#WRF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[41751\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600059#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review an appeal by a school (details supplied) under the exceptional accommodation difficulties to allow an additional teacher to be appointed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on the Department's website.

The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020. The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth. Key findings within the report related to the high replacement\/exit rates in the sector which has implications for the ongoing skill requirements of the sector and also with regards to staff retention, including education and training, and workplace conditions and remuneration.  <\/p>  <p>  The Study assessed skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings. The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020, including the need to establish a National Oversight and Advisory Group, comprising of key hospitality stakeholders, to provide a forum for on-going collaboration to support the needs of the sector and oversee implementation of the EGFSN recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The oversight group was established in 2016, and was mandated for two year period.

Networks have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers to identify training needs, design training programmes, recruit learners and deliver training on and off the job. There are currently three hospitality traineeships available with further traineeships in development.<\/p>  <p>  A Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet was established in 2017 and, along with the Taste 4 Success Skillnet, will address skill needs in the sector.

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advises parents to seek to enrol their child by applying in writing to the school\/s of their choice as early as possible.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school for the 2018\/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.<\/p><p>The greater proportion of children with special educational needs attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. <\/p><p>Some students with special educational needs, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there and placement in a special class is an option for them.

Each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) has selected an initial pilot area within its functional area, in which it considers, based on census data and local knowledge, that there exists a demand for more diversity in educational provision.  Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City\/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs.  ETBs, having analysed the survey results, draw up comprehensive reports on the position in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas.  This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron\/landowner in the area (the Catholic Bishop in most cases) concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand.  The response by the landowner\/patron to any identified demand for greater diversity is included in the report prepared by the ETB for submission to my Department, which will subsequently publish the reports.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of the first round of reports, the Schools Reconfiguration process will move into the Implementation Phase.  This Phase involves consultation with local school communities on accommodating demand for diversity by transferring patronage of an existing school to a new multi-\/non-denominational patron.  Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Kildare specifically, a town\/area in County Kildare has not been identified for survey as Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board has chosen to survey Bray in Co. Wicklow as part of this initial roll-out.  A second round of town selections and surveys of pre-school parents will be organised by ETBs when the outcomes of the initial round of pilot surveys have been assessed and any necessary adjustments made in the Schools Reconfiguration process.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this new Schools Reconfiguration process, which involves the transfer of live schools, has the potential to significantly increase patronage diversity in our school system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600063#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Data","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600064#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[42502\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600064#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which extra teachers have been deployed at primary and second level throughout County Kildare in line with requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[42503\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600064#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which extra teachers have been deployed at primary and second level throughout the country in line with requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 and 271 together.<\/p><p>Teacher allocations to all schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.

The HEA engages with HEIs on their performance against these domains through a process of strategic dialogue and through the use of performance funding.  The new Framework covers the period 2018 - 2020. The promotion of &lsquo;excellence in teaching and learning to underpin a high-quality student experience&rsquo; is one of the 7 &lsquo;key system objectives&rsquo; in the System Performance Framework, and the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning supports the implementation of best international practice ensuring that opportunities for better practice are identified, mainstreamed and shared under the guidance of the Higher Education Authority and sectoral representative bodies.  <\/p>  <p>  Quality assurance procedures are in place within HEIs in accordance with Guidelines as set out by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  An Annual Institutional Quality Assurance Report is submitted to QQI which outlines the institutions cycle of internal reviews along with links to published review reports.  These internal reviews comprise of any or all of regular periodic reviews of study programmes; quality reviews of academic, administrative and service departments; unit-based reviews of schools, faculties and colleges and thematic reviews of institution-wide issues.

The Government has secured a total package which provides for &euro;57.4 million of additional expenditure in Higher Education in 2019.As part of Budget 2019, the Government committed to increasing the National Training Fund levy by a further 0.1% in 2019 to 0.9%, and by a further 0.1% in 2020. Additionally a new Human Capital Initiative has been announced as part of budget 2019. This will involve investment of &euro;300m over the 5 year period 2020-2024, with &euro;60m being made available in each of those years. This investment will be funded by the NTF surplus.  There is also a significant ramping up of Government investment on the capital side of the higher education sector and over a 10 year period, investment of some &euro;2.2 billion is envisaged. To complement and underpin the additional investment in Higher Education a number of strategic reforms measures are also being undertaken by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Technological universities will provide an opportunity to drive regional development and provide more opportunities for students, staff, enterprise and local and regional communities.

Phase One has now been completed, with Divisional Protective Services Units established in three Divisions, in the DMR West, Cork City, and Louth Division, where 2 Sergeants and 10 Garda&iacute; were identified for allocation to the Divisional Unit. <\/p><p>Following a review of the Pilot, additional Divisional Protective Services Bureaus are now in the process of being established in DMR South Central; Waterford; Kerry; Kilkenny\/Carlow; Limerick and Galway Garda Divisions before the end of Q4, 2018. It is intended that Divisional Protective Services Bureaus will be established in all remaining Garda Divisions before the end of 2019.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that this initiative is being managed collaboratively between the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and each Divisional Officer. The pilot will inform the full roll-out to each Garda Division, by assessing and evaluating the Units initially selected including with reference to for example geographical size and population profile. <\/p><p>The Commissioner has further informed me that all Garda personnel receive training in the investigation of incidents considered domestic abuse, in all it&rsquo;s forms, with additional training provided to Garda&iacute; selected for duties as detectives. Similarly, additional and more specific training has been developed by the Director of Training with the senior management team at the Garda National Protective Services Bureau for the training to be provided to personnel selected for duty with the Divisional Protective Services Units, which have commenced in the three Garda divisions, DMR West, Cork City and Louth. Induction training has been provided for the personnel selected for these Units, with a briefing being provided to all relevant State Agencies and NGOs.<\/p><p>The Policing Authority submitted their Fifth Progress Report to me in June. This report was partly focused on providing an update on the implementation of the recommendations contained within the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s report Changing Policing in Ireland, including the roll out of the pilot Divisional Protective Services Units. It is positive to note that the Policing Authority&rsquo;s engagement with organisations that work with victims, as well as the recent Garda Inspectorate Report on Child Sexual Abuse, evidence the anticipated improvement in services for victims arising from the roll out of the Protective Services Units. In addition, it is to be welcomed that the Policing Authority has received positive feedback that the pilot PSUs have resulted in improved levels of service to victims and increased operational effectiveness in dealing with crimes of that nature.<\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the recently published Commission on the Future of Policing report sees the establishment of Divisional Protective Services Units as a significant move in the right direction towards ensuring that services to victims&rsquo; rights are further embedded in the organisation&rsquo;s processes.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 provides an unprecedented level of public funding of &euro;1.76 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019.  This includes an in crease in the Garda capital allocation from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT, a further &euro;10 million investment in the Transport Fleet and &euro;17 million in the Building Programme. This clearly  demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600064#WRL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Civilian Staff Recruitment","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600064#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[41908\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600064#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of civilians recruited to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":495,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who has responsibility to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;ochana, including by arranging for the recruitment, training and appointment of its members and civilian staff.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 12 October, 282 civilians have been recruited to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018. This excludes another 6 staff who have been recruited on secondment. Some of these civilian staff were recruited to backfill existing vacancies, some were to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline duties and others were to fill newly created civilian posts to fill skill gaps across the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians. This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  The Garda Inspectorate identified some 1,500 posts held by Garda&iacute; that could be examined for suitability for civilian staff.<\/p>  <p>  Progress is being made in relation to civilianisation. Since the beginning of 2017 approximately 300 new civilian posts have been sanctioned by the Policing Authority with the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The bulk were to address critical skills gaps and capacity issues with a proportion sanctioned to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent overall figure provided to me by the Commissioner indicates that, as at 31 August 2018 approximately 2,330 civilians were employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to advance however it is clear that the pace of civilianisation needs to increase.  I note that the Report of the  Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland recommends the return of Garda&iacute; to front line policing and the need for visible policing.

The deposit is usually regarded both as a part payment of the purchase price of the property and as a security for or a guarantee of performance of the contract by the purchaser.<\/p><p>As a general rule it has been well settled in case law that the vendor may retain (or forfeit) the deposit if the purchaser defaults on the contract (<i>Doyle v.

Equally, case law provides that the purchaser may recover the amount of the deposit, with interest, plus the cost of investigating the title of the property if the vendor defaults on the terms of the contract (<i>Dickie v.

No.  27 of 1995).

The competence to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute corruption is spread across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of other agencies with a mandate to tackle corruption.  These include tribunals of inquiry, commissions of investigation, inspectors, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO), local authorities, the Ombudsman, Parliamentary Committees on Members' Interests, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and it's newly established Anti-Corruption Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee and the Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p><p>Equally, legislative provisions to prevent corruption are manifold and not exclusive to my Department.  For example, the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, as amended by the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, addresses the ethical conduct of public officials and the lobbying of public officials is covered by the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  The Standards in Public Office Commission is responsible for regulatory functions in relation to these statutes.  Likewise, transparency and whistleblowing provisions are provided for via the Freedom of Information Act 2014 and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Additionally, policy and procedures relating to public procurement are primarily the responsibility of the Office of Government Procurement.  There are many further features to effective anti-corruption policy framework, including anti money laundering provisions, tax transparency, and the enforcement of company law.<\/p><p><b>International Commitments<\/b><\/p><p>I can reassure the Deputy that Ireland remains firmly committed to the fight against corruption, both domestically and internationally.  Ireland is a party to a number of international agreements, including the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Public Officials in International Business Transactions.  <\/p><p>As a party to these international agreements, Ireland has undergone numerous evaluations and remains subject to peer reviews under the review mechanisms associated with these international standards.  Ireland has recently completed a review of its implementation of Chapters II and V of the UNCAC Convention.  <\/p><p><b>Review of Anti-Corruption Structures<\/b><\/p><p>Mr James Hamilton, former DPP and Anti-Corruption expert, is chairing a Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption structures.  This review is an Action Point, assigned to the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, contained in the Government&rsquo;s plan to tackle White Collar Crime, which was launched last November.  The first meeting of the group took place on Monday, 24 September and is due to meet again next week.<\/p><p>Attendees included all bodies identified in the Terms of Reference as critical for this review, including all State bodies involved in the detection, prevention, investigation and prosecution of White Collar Crime.  The Review Group includes officials from the Departments of Justice &amp;amp; Equality; Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation; Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the DPP, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Banking and Payments Federation, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank.<\/p><p>At the first meeting the group discussed their working methods, defined the scope of the Review and the Chair sought position papers from a number of Members outlining their own areas of responsibility.  The group also discussed the possibility of opening a public consultation, allowing individuals to make submissions to the group in writing, and in person, at a possible public meeting in early 2019.<\/p><p>The Review Group is due to report in June 2019.<\/p><p><b>Legislation<\/b><\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act became law on 5 June 2018.  This Act repeals the previous seven prevention of Corruption Acts dating back as far as 1889.  However it is more than a consolidation, it represents a complete overhaul of the criminal law in this area and introduces a range of new offences.  Most offences apply to both the public and private sector.  An offence of trading in influence is introduced for the first time.  The offence contained in section 7 is directed solely at the public sector and it relates to Irish officials doing certain acts in relation to their office or using confidential information for the purpose of corruptly obtaining a gift, consideration or advantage.  Similarly, the new offence in section 18 is directed solely at the private sector and introduces a strict liability offence whereby a body corporate will be guilty if anyone directly connected with the body corporate commits a corruption offence with the intention of benefitting the body corporate.  This offence is rebuttable but it will be up to the body corporate to prove it took all reasonable steps to avoid the commission of the offence.  <\/p><p>The Act includes strong penalties to reflect the seriousness of the offence.  Penalties include up to ten years imprisonment and a possible unlimited fine in the case of  bodies corporate.The Act is a comprehensive, modern piece of legislation that responds to various recommendations made by the Mahon Tribunal, the OECD, the United Nations and from GRECO, the Council of Europe anti-corruption body.<\/p><p><b>Transparency International<\/b><\/p><p>The Deputy refers to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2017.  The index, which ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption according to experts and businesspeople, uses a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean.  Ireland's score in 2017 was 74 out of 100 and, as the Deputy notes, this indicates little appreciable difference since 2016 in the perception of corruption in Ireland, according to this survey instrument.<\/p><p>It is important to note, however, that Ireland's score has improved significantly since 2012, having risen 5 points on the Index's scale from 69 to 74.  Further, Ireland ranks well above the global average of 43 and that of Western Europe &ndash; the highest ranking region in the index with an average score of 66.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600065#WRM05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":555,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600066#WRN00400"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[42239\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600066#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that deportation of a person (details supplied) may lead to a serious threat to his or her well-being; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":557,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned is the subject of Deportation Orders made on 15 September 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  As previously advised, this order requires the person concerned to remove themselves from the State and to remain out of the State.

This funding is guided by Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) being an essential component in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in the market. <\/p>  <p>  Companies and researchers that receive RDI grant support generate intellectual property and technical know-how in Ireland.  Many of these RDI projects lead to manufacturing of new products, which further embed the companies in Ireland and, where relevant, increase the strategic importance of the Irish facility within the Global entity. This, in turn, contributes to the potential to increase employment in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Information across the three agencies referenced above is not available in a format that allows for a definitive figure to be provided on \"medicines research and development\". However, the information provided below indicates that medical and pharma-related R&amp;D forms a significant part of the R&amp;D supported in each agency. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, IDA Ireland paid a total of &euro;54,251,000 in RDI grants to its clients to undertake RDI across a variety of sectors, including Technology, Life Sciences, Medical Technologies and Engineering.  Included in the above total is a figure of &euro;13,900,000 which was paid to IDA Ireland clients in the pharma sector. Whilst some of this funding may be for drug research, it is not possible to confirm that all the funding is used exclusively for that purpose.<\/p>  <p>  For the most part, Science Foundation Ireland does not ring-fence or pre-allocate funds for specific areas of research.  SFI funds oriented basic research and applied research in all areas of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).  All of the research funded by SFI undergoes rigorous international peer review.  From time to time, the agency may run a competitive call in a defined research area where it has been identified that there is a specific gap in Ireland&rsquo;s capabilities or an identified opportunity or challenge which Ireland can and should address.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, SFI invested over &euro;33,720,000 in research related to medicines research and development. The awards cover areas directly, and more remotely, relevant to medicines research including drug\/medicines discovery, but mostly synthesis, formulation, processing technologies, delivery. Significant awards in the medicine research and development areas include the SFI Research Centres, SSPC and C&Uacute;RAM.<\/p>  <p>  The Synthesis and Solid State Pharmaceutical Centre (SSPC) SFI Research Centre led by University of Limerick, is a global hub of pharmaceutical process innovation and advanced manufacturing. SSPC leads the way for next generation drug manufacture and spans the entire pharmaceutical production chain from synthesis of the molecule, to the isolation of the material, and formulation of the medicine. <\/p>  <p>  C&Uacute;RAM, SFI&rsquo;s Research Centre led by National University of Ireland in Galway, aims to radically improve health outcomes for patients by developing &lsquo;smart&rsquo; medical devices and implants. C&Uacute;RAM&rsquo;s research programme focuses on innovative design, assessment and manufacture of medical devices and is driven by specialist researchers, clinicians and industry partners, ultimately translating research into clinical settings.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in 2017, Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;5,000,000 in financial support to client companies to support medicine research and development. Enterprise Ireland also has a range of supports for collaborative projects with the Higher Education Sector.  However, further analysis would be required to determine what share of this funding was allocated to medicines research and development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600066#WRN04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600066#WRN04500"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[42035\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600066#WRN04600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the uptake of the various schemes to allow businesses to prepare for Brexit in tabular form;

An employment agency operating from outside Ireland, will be subject to the regulation, if any, of the jurisdiction in which it is located.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive suite of employment rights legislation provides that employee protection extends to agency workers in Ireland, including agency workers posted to Ireland, who have entered into a contract of employment that provides for him or her being employed in the state or who works in the state under a contract of employment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600067#WRO02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Budgets","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600067#WRO02800"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[42394\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600067#WRO02900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the 2018 and the new 2019 budget allocations as outlined in budget 2019 for the offices and agencies under the remit of her Department in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":629,"content":"<p>The distribution of exchequer funding allocations as per the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume for each Office and Agency under the aegis of my Department and as provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote is set out in the table.  <\/p><p>I would advise the Deputy that the funding provision to Enterprise Ireland covers two subheads on my Department&rsquo;s Vote, Subheads A7 and B4, which span general supports to indigenous firms and for research and development\/innovation supports.

HIHI is a joint initiative between my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  <\/p>  <p>  HIHI is a consortium led by University College Cork and comprising Cork Institute of Technology, National University of Ireland Galway &amp;amp; Trinity College Dublin.  I officially launched HIHI in University College Cork in September 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the initiative is to drive collaboration between the health service and the enterprise sector and the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies, products and services emerging from within the health service, and\/or the enterprise sector.  HIHI is built on the recognition that collaboration with enterprise can benefit patient care, patient pathways and outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  The objectives behind the development of a Health Innovation Hub are:<\/p>  <p>  -  to allow healthcare companies to deliver commercial products and services more quickly by giving them appropriate access to the health service in order to test and validate and refine products in a real life environment.<\/p>  <p>  -  to allow the health service to find efficiencies and improvements (including to services and patient outcomes) by facilitating the HSE and hospitals to engage with innovative companies creating solutions to problems they face, and<\/p>  <p>  -  to support the adoption\/commercialisation of new innovations developed by healthcare practitioners inside the healthcare service <\/p>  <p>  HIHI has issued two calls, the first in 2016 and a second once which just closed in August 2018.  I recently opened the second office of HIHI in St James Hospital, Dublin.  Since its establishment HIHI has managed 200 company engagements, ran 25 studies in Irish healthcare settings, 72 companies receiving follow up support through HIHI.  The recent HIHI call has shown a 46 % increase in applications to the HIHI national call aimed at companies, start-ups, SMEs compared with 2016.    <\/p>  <p>  A core part of HIHI in Dublin is the design and delivery of an education programmes for those working in Irish healthcare that will build a sustainable culture of improvement and innovation.  It is hoped that people who participate in these programmes then become catalysts for innovation within the health system <\/p>  <p>  HIHI was awarded &euro;5 million in funding by Enterprise Ireland for five years IN 2016.  In addition the HSE is receiving &euro;0.260m annually since 2017 to support the provision of 3.9 FTE to HIHI.  Importantly the HSE also provides significant in-kind support to the Hub.<\/p>  <p>  eHealth Ireland, the body tasked with the promotion and implementation of the eHealth agenda in Ireland, supports innovation in eHealth through a series of events including the eHealth ecosystem, the annual 'Health Innovation Week' and hosting 'Innovation Challenges' across Ireland to encourage entrepreneurs, technologists and health care innovators both within the HSE and externally the opportunity and environment to develop their ideas and concepts further. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in co-operation with the HSE and eHealth Ireland, has made considerable progress to introduce technological improvements to our health services with the aim of improving patient safety and efficiencies.  eHealth Ireland trial new ICT technology through their Quality Innovation Corridor (QIC) technology programme which has a maximum funding application amount of &euro;25k each.  The programme is primarily aimed at the assessment of the application of new technology, rather than for the innovation of new products.  I have been advised that each QIC application is appraised on its merits and as such, expenditure is made on a case-by-case basis.

Lyme borreliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to <i>Borrelia burgdorferi <\/i>produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  <\/p><p>Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association.  Whereas Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly and are also accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the relevant tests correctly, testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards) to a similar degree, giving rise to a greater degree of risk of diagnosis of a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result or interpreting equivocal results in a manner that is more likely to give rise to verification bias. <\/p><p>Best practice dictates that if a patient presents themselves in front of a GP or consultant in Ireland with a report\/test from another EU member state and they are seeking ongoing treatment for a particular illness, the GP or consultant would examine the patient using both clinical and laboratory diagnostics confirmed before they would be in a position to prescribe a course of treatment for them.  The same protocol would apply across most other EU member states as the GP or consultant would need to be totally satisfied that the patient is correctly diagnosed while getting the right course of treatment for their illness.  <\/p><p>Patients can seek to access health care in another EU\/EEA member state via two different schemes.  Where a service is provided in Ireland but a patient wishes to access care in another EU\/EEA Member State, this can be possible by seeking treatment under the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare, otherwise known as the Cross Border Directive (CBD).  The HSE operates the CBD in Ireland.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians.  In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the CBD on its website which can be accessed at: <i>hse.ie\/eng\/services\/list\/1\/schemes\/cbd\/ <\/i>and also by phone at (056) 7784551. <\/p><p>The HSE advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorisation before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP. <\/p><p>The HSE also operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation (EC) No. 883\/2004, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations (EC) No. 987\/2009.  The TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is:<\/p><p>-  Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation;<\/p><p>-  Not available in Ireland; and<\/p><p>-  Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease. <\/p><p>GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS.  The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend.  Applications to the TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways.

The current legislation, the European Communities (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004, transposed EU Directive 2001\/20\/EC on clinical trials into Irish law. A new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EU Regulation 536\/2014, was adopted in May 2014 and is scheduled to be implemented in 2020.  The new Regulation aims to create an environment that is favourable for conducting clinical trials, with the highest standards of patient safety, across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  The benefits of the new Clinical Trials Regulation will include:<\/p>  <p>  -  Harmonised electronic submission and assessment process for clinical trials conducted in multiple Member States.<\/p>  <p>  -  Improved collaboration, information-sharing and decision-making between and within Member States.<\/p>  <p>  -  Increased transparency, with information on the authorisation, conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the EU to be made publicly available. <\/p>  <p>  At national level the Health Research Board (HRB) is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. It is important to note that the HRB  funds a great deal of research which is not directly aimed at the development of products. This includes most of its health services and population health research portfolio. Within the clinical trials space the HRB funds testing of medicinal products, medical devices as well as processes and therapies such as physical or psychotherapy without an associated product. It needs to be understood that great public benefit can arise from understanding how things can be done better outside of the development of products.<\/p>  <p>  The HRB, in funding health research projects is committed to the highest standards and principles such as integrity, transparency, fairness and accountability; collaboration and co-operation and a focus on outcomes and impact. Examples of how they work to achieve these aims include the following:<\/p>  <p>  -  The HRB has been at the forefront of developing public and patient involvement (PPI) in research in Ireland. This aims to drive the relevance and improve the conduct of research.<\/p>  <p>  -  HRB allocation of research funding is made following international peer review to ensure that only those proposals of the highest quality are funded.   <\/p>  <p>  -  Considerable investment has been made by the HRB, with funding from my Department, in developing a clinical research landscape in Ireland that can provide the supports and infrastructure to facilitate clinical trials of medicinal products, diagnostics and medical devices, such that they can be robustly evaluated to ensure their safety and efficacy.  <\/p>  <p>  -  As part of its funding criteria, the HRB  requires the registration of all regulated clinical trials and the publication of trial outcomes. Through its Open Publishing Platform (HRB Open Research), the HRB facilitates the publication of protocols and results. HRB Clinical Research Co-Ordination Ireland (HRB-CRCI) co-ordinates multi-site clinical trials activity in Ireland as well as collaborative and multi-disciplinary projects.  <\/p>  <p>  -  The HRB terms and conditions for its funded research set out a number of clauses that cover oversight, accountability, transparency and protection of intellectual property of grant funding.  <\/p>  <p>  -  The terms and conditions accepted by host institutions for HRB funding cover publication and broader public dissemination of results, and appropriate protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in line with the National Intellectual Property Protocol, \"Inspiring Partnership - the National IP Protocol 2016: Policies and Resources to help industry make good use of public research in Ireland\".  This protocol encourages the use of non-exclusive licensing. Information on all HRB-funded awards is publicly available on its website.<\/p>  <p>  The HRB monitor adherence to their terms and conditions of grants. They do this through annual and interim review and the collection of detailed evaluation data.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600069#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Administration","counter":739,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600069#WRQ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":740,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[41889\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600069#WRQ02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to increase the allocation of home care package funding to CHO area 8; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":741,"content":"<p>The Home Support Service is a core service for older people and is highly valued by service users, their families and by the HSE.

The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.  The Strategy emphasises the need for a \"whole community response\" to dementia, as the majority of people with dementia live in their own communities and wish to avail of services in their local area.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages (IHCPs) to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home.

The scope of these reviews includes the labs contracted to provide services for CervicalCheck, and review of the slides of women diagnosed with cervical cancer who participated in the CervicalCheck programme. Together, these two strands of investigation provide the independent external expertise required to address the issues raised in relation to CervicalCheck.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry into CervicalCheck was led by Dr Gabriel Scally. The Terms of Reference of the Inquiry were developed following cross-party engagement and included an examination of the tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information and performance management, accreditation and quality assurance of contracted cytology laboratory services by CervicalCheck from initiation of the programme. Dr Scally's expert team, which included cytopathology expertise, visited the labs as part of his report. He has confirmed he is satisfied with the quality management processes in the current laboratory sites. <\/p>  <p>  Crucially, he has confirmed that he finds no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced.

A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications.

I published a three year Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy in August 2018, based on the eight principle in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. <\/p><p>I have been clear since the report was published that I am fully committed to the vision and policy direction which it sets out. I have also been clear however, that I believe that some of the timelines outlined in the report were ambitious given the inter-dependencies involved in a large scale reform programme of this nature. For this reason the Implementation Strategy  has re-prioritised or proposed to phase some recommendations over a different time frame than that envisaged in the report. <\/p><p>It is noted that the original Sl&aacute;intecare Report envisaged that &euro;350 - &euro;400 million would be needed annually in the initial years of the reform programme. I understand that the team of academics that supported the Committee&rsquo;s work recently presented revised timelines and annual costings to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and now estimate an annual funding requirement of &euro;200m - &euro;250 million. I am pleased that the revised costings support my own view that the initial timelines and costings in the report were ambitious.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that many of the items in Table 3 are funded under the National Development Plan announced earlier this year which commits &euro;10.4bn to health infrastructure including a number of priority Sl&aacute;intecare actions. This includes capital funding for:<\/p><p>- 2,600 acute hospital beds;<\/p><p>- 4,500 additional long and short-term beds;<\/p><p>- Elective only hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway;<\/p><p>- A modern ehealth and ICT infrastructure;<\/p><p>- Additional Primary Care facilities with greater access to diagnostics; and<\/p><p>- Additional facilities for mental health services and for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>I am delighted that the recent Budget provided an increase of &euro;1.05 billion in Health funding. This brings the health budget for 2019 to &euro;17 billion.  This is the highest level of Health investment in the history of the State. This will allow the health service to meet additional demands due to the demographic pressure of a growing and aging population. <\/p><p>The Budget features over &euro;200m additional funding which  will directly support a range of additional services including initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. The Deputy will appreciate that as some of these are subject to negotiation, I am not in a position to provide a detailed breakdown. However it includes:<\/p><p>- Ringfenced funding for the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office;<\/p><p>- &euro;20m for the establishment of a new ring-fenced Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund to drive improvements in the way we deliver care across the system;<\/p><p>- Funding for a new GP contract;<\/p><p>- Expansion of free GP care, by increase in the weekly income threshold for GP Visit card by &euro;25 which could benefit up to 100,000 people;<\/p><p>- Additional funding for 100 new therapy posts to address assessment of need waiting lists for children with disabilities and funding to ensure that the needs of all those leaving school in 2019 will be addressed;<\/p><p>- &euro;55m in new development funding aimed at further enhancing community mental health teams for adults and children;<\/p><p>- Reducing user charges and out of pocket payments by further reductions in prescription charges - 50 cent reduction in prescription charges from &euro;2.00 to &euro;1.50 for all medical card holders over the age of 70 and by a &euro;10 reduction in the monthly Drugs Payment Scheme threshold from &euro;134 to &euro;124;<\/p><p>- Increased investment of &euro;20m in the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This funding will be used to treat 70,000 patients on waiting lists in 2019; and<\/p><p>- Additional funding for  care redesign and the National Children's Hospital.<\/p><p>The Executive Director is currently preparing a detailed action plan, as mandated by Government,  for 2019 which will be published before the end of the year. <\/p><p>I believe that this budget provided an excellent basis for progressing the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation Strategy in 2019 and I  look forward to being able to report positive progress throughout 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Training","counter":962,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03000"},{"type":"question","counter":963,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[42169\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the respective number of extra training places for general practitioners, consultants and primary care staff that will be funded in 2019.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":964,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Delays","counter":965,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03300"},{"type":"question","counter":966,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[42180\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay in a medical card application by a person (details supplied) being finalised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":967,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03600"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[42184\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a home support package will be put in place for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1225","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":970,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":971,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU03900"},{"type":"question","counter":972,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[42232\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600073#WRU04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a reply will issue to correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1267","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":973,"content":"<p>I would like to apologise that no response ever issued to this request.

It is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.  Lyme neuroborreliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).<\/p><p>Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borreliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination.  Lyme disease may be treated by infectious diseases specialists (of which there are 12 nationally) or by general internal medicine available in all acute hospitals. Medical training programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level in Ireland provide specialist training in infectious diseases, including Lyme disease.<\/p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of the HPSC established a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention with a view to minimising the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Subcommittee will shortly be meeting to consider its final report to the SAC.  During the report&rsquo;s preparation, the HPSC learned that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK was undertaking a systematic review of Lyme disease which resulted in the NICE Lyme disease guidelines.

The NTPF allocation for 2019 is &euro;75m.  The full allocation to the NTPF is now reflected in the published Expenditure Report 2019 available on <i>www.budget.gov.ie<\/i>and will be reflected in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2019 published before year end.<\/p><p>Up to 2018 the H subhead reflected funding for statutory pension lump payments only.  All other pension funding was held in the Health Service Executive subheads I1 to I5.  To improve transparency and the linkage between the Health Vote subheads and the Health Service Executives National Service Plan in 2019 subhead H was amended to reflect all HSE pension funding including lump sums.  From 2019 this subhead will now reflect the full pension costs as set out in the National Service Plan for 2019.<\/p><p>The 2018 Health Vote for net exchequer pension costs was &euro;649.476m. Pension related deductions (PRD) were netted against pay.  In 2019, as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement, PRD will convert to Additional Superannuation Contributions (ASC), and therefore, are also netted off pensions costs for the 2019 Health Vote.  It is the presentation of these additional superannuation contributions that is driving the perceived 24% reduction in exchequer pension costs. <\/p><p>It was determined that the format of subheads for I1 to I5 causes confusion as they do not align with how HSE performance is reported.  The HSE reports performance against their annual service plan which is set out by service division.  The HSE does not plan or report on services delivery by HSE region or on a statutory\/voluntary basis as indicated by the previous subheads I1 to I5.To improve the linkage between the estimates presentation and the NSP the following adjustments were made.<\/p><p>Subhead I now represents the funding allocated to HSE service areas set out in the National Service Plan with the exception of PCRS\/Local Demand Led Schemes and Long Term Residential Care which are funded from Subheads K1 and K2 respectively.  It includes funding for new operational services developments for 2019 and excludes all pension related costs.  Pension costs are now reported in total in subhead H.<\/p><p>The 10% increase in subhead I arises due to the increase in health  funding for 2019 of &euro;1.5 billion as set out in the budget book, less the funds applicable to subheads E, H, K.1 and K.2 as above.<\/p><p>An actuarial assessment for potential claims under the CIS is prepared annually by the State Claims Agency and a determination is taken with regard to the level of funding that will be required by year end, under subhead J4.<\/p><p>Regarding subhead K1; Medicines play a vital role in improving the health of Irish patients. Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The allocation provided under K1 for 2019 is arrived at following considerable consideration and analysis of a range of factors.  The detailed allocation of the funding will be finalised as part of the preparation by the HSE of their 2019 National Service Plan.<\/p><p>Under EU regulations, where a person is employed in or a pensioner of one member state but residing or staying in another, the member state of employment or paying the pension must in general bear the responsibility for the cost of health services. As the number of Irish people living here who worked previously in the United Kingdom holding British pensions is considerable, a reimbursement agreement has been agreed between the two countries. The Appropriations-in-Aid receipt represents the U.K.'s net liability to this country.  Following detailed engagement with UK officials it has been indicated that the net position due from the UK for 2018 will be &euro;55m below planned on an ongoing basis giving rise to the 12% reduction in receipts reflected for 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600077#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600077#WRY02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Appeals","counter":1151,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600077#WRY02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1152,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[41748\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600077#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of an over claim appeal by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1153,"content":"<p>An application under the 2018 Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) was lodged on behalf of the person named on 14 February 2018.

This network includes circa 80 fast chargers, mainly on national routes. A map showing the charge points, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB's website at <i>www.esb.ie\/ecars<\/i>. <\/p><p>The maintenance and repair of these charge points is an operational matter for the ESB.\u00a0In relation to\u00a0the out-of-service charge point in Killarney, the ESB has informed my Department that the manufacturer is due to come to Ireland in the coming weeks to visit the charge point. At this point it is expected that the issue will be resolved. I am also informed that the fast charge point in Tralee is located at a car dealership and not operated by the ESB.<\/p><p>The provision of charging infrastructure is a necessity for the uptake of electric vehicles. In this regard, last month's\u00a0publication by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities of their approval of ESB Networks' proposal on the future operation and maintenance of the charging network is a welcome development. This ensures the continued operation and maintenance of the public charging network by the ESB and provides the certainty electric vehicle users need when purchasing an electric vehicle. <\/p><p>I understand that the ESB has commenced work to resolve the maintenance issues with the public charging network. This includes upgrades and, in the case of those with the highest reliability issues, replacement of public chargers. I am informed that it\u00a0has replaced 15 standard chargers, constituting 30 charge points as well upgrading seven older fast chargers with newer chargers that can accommodate all three charging types that are in active use in Ireland. The ESB advises me that the uptime of the fleet of fast chargers is in excess of 98% which is very high by international standards.<\/p><p>A\u00a0key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network. The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and will focus on\u00a0an expanded range of supports for the provision of effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.<\/p><p>In this regard, my Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging.<\/p><p>It is also important to note the role\u00a0of the Climate Action Fund.

It is expected that any future changes to connection\u00a0rules will be consulted on by the CRU before any decisions are made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600079#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1237,"content":"<p>Question No. 546 answered with Question No. 535.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Warmer Homes Scheme Eligibility","counter":1238,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600079#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1239,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[42130\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600079#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) is not eligible for the SEAI better energy warmer homes scheme.","asker":"1306","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1240,"content":"<p>The Warmer Homes Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).\u00a0 The Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the defined eligibility criteria.<\/p>  <p>  In reference to the case raised by Deputy Collins, officials in my Department have been in contact with the SEAI and I have been informed that the applicant applied for works under the Scheme in 2017 but as the walls would not have been insulated the applicant did not proceed with the works at the time.\u00a0 In June this year the Scheme was expanded to include insulation of solid walls.\u00a0 As the applicant did not have any previous work carried out under the Warmer Homes Scheme I would advise the applicant to contact SEAI on 1850 250 204 to make a new application, and note that proof of eligibility will be required also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600079#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":1241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600079#WRAA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1242,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[42142\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600079#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when broadband will be rolled out in an area (details supplied).","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1243,"content":"<p>In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.

The Better Energy Communities (BEC) Scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area. Upgrades can take place across building types to reduce energy use and costs, Partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers, and leverage considerable additional private investment. The BEC supports renewable energy projects as well as energy efficiency projects.\u00a0 In 2018, 37 projects have been approved funding totalling &euro;22m.<\/p><p>The Sustainable Energy Communities (SEC)\u00a0Programme provides the first step for communities in learning how to develop local partnerships to manage and conserve their energy before they apply to the Better Energy Communities Scheme.\u00a0 A SEC aims to be energy efficient, to use renewable energy where feasible and to develop decentralised energy supplies. The community can include all the different energy users in the area including; homes, sports clubs, community centres, churches and businesses. Over 200 community groups have signed up to the SEC network since it was launched in 2015 and are availing of technical support and mentoring from SEAI. In 2018, 17 Sustainable Energy Community projects have been offered grants totalling &euro;2.44million, to enable them to carry out smaller energy projects as identified in their Energy Master Plans.<\/p><p>Turning to offshore renewable energy there\u00a0are a range of supports available to developers in bringing their devices from prototype to full scale commercial viability.\u00a0 Exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration has been provided to the sector in recent years and was increased under the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP).\u00a0 The Department&rsquo;s multi-annual ocean energy development budget was increased by &euro;21.3 million, covering the period 2013 to 2017, which brought the total cumulative funding to &euro;31.05 million.\u00a0 This funding supports the development of the test facilities in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, and the Prototype Development Fund (PDF). The PDF supports innovation by providing funding to offshore renewable energy development projects. <\/p><p>Since 2009, the Fund has supported 110 projects. 18 projects are currently being funded, with a further\u00a06 being evaluated by SEAI and 10 that have already been completed in 2018. A further &euro;4.75 million has been allocated to Ocean Energy development in 2018. <\/p><p>Finally, the\u00a0SEAI\u00a0Research, Development &amp;amp; Demonstration Fund invests in innovative energy projects which contribute to Ireland's transition to a clean and secure energy future. The SEAI RD&amp;amp;D Funding Programme aims to: <\/p><p>- Accelerate the development and deployment in the Irish marketplace of competitive energy-related products, processes and systems <\/p><p>- Support solutions that enable technical and other barriers to market uptake to be overcome <\/p><p>- Grow Ireland's national capacity to access, develop and apply international class RD&amp;amp;D <\/p><p>- Provide guidance and support to policy makers and public bodies through results, outcomes and learning from supported energy projects.<\/p><p>The 2019 Call is expected to open for applications from late Q4 2018. Further details of the RD&amp;amp;D Programme can be found at:<\/p><p>In relation to renewable energy, the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, and we have committed to achieve this\u00a0 through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. <\/p><p>The most recent annual data from the SEAI\u00a0indicates that 30.1% of electricity, 6.9% of heat and 7.2% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2017.\u00a0Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources. <\/p><p>Electricity production from wind energy has increased to the point that it accounted for 84% of the renewable electricity generated in 2017.

It is expected that the first renewable electricity auctions will take place under the RESS in 2019.<\/p><p>The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) also launched\u00a0this year, is open to all non-domestic heat users not operating in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The purpose of the scheme is to reduce the use of fossil fuels within the heating sector. \u00a0<\/p><p>Turning finally to energy infrastructure, Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Transmission System Operator (TSO), EirGrid, has a key role in planning for the development of renewable energy infrastructure and the electricity transmission system to meet the future needs of society. This involves detailed analysis of electricity demand, electricity supply, electricity storage and interconnection, and locations of electricity demand and supply. A process is currently underway to consider a range of possible ways that energy usage may change in the future, and a series of scenarios are\u00a0 central to an extensive consultation that is being undertaken, covering four scenarios; \u00a0Steady Evolution, Low Carbon Living, Slow Change, and Consumer Action.

The creation of a NECP is one of the key provisions of the proposed Governance of the Energy Union Regulation, part of the European Clean Energy Package published in November 2016.  This is an overarching, consolidating regulation that will consolidate the existing patchwork of national energy and climate planning and reporting obligations.  The NECP\u00a0will include trajectories for renewable energy (including renewable electricity), energy efficiency, and national emissions, as well as the measures required to achieve these trajectories.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan, which will cover all five dimensions of the Energy Union, will contain the policies and measures proposed to reach our 2030 energy and climate goals, and will be based on a common EU template to allow for comparability.  The first draft is due for submission to the European Commission by 31 December 2018, with the final version due by 31 December 2019. Energy and Climate Change modelling work to look at energy and climate policy options out to 2030 has already started under the auspices of the Technical Research and Modelling (TRAM) Group.

These included raising the level of childcare subsidy available for families that need it most by up to 50% (from a maximum of &euro;95 to &euro;145 per week for children up to the age of fifteen). I also introduced a brand new universal subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 per annum for children under three in registered childcare. Over the past year these measures have reached the families of more than 84,000 children.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, rather than adjusting the existing schemes, which will continue to be available until the Affordable Childcare Scheme is in place, I announced changes to the income thresholds that will operate as part of the Affordable Childcare Scheme when it is introduced later next year.<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme&rsquo;s original policy proposals, income-based subsidies would have been available to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;47,500.  This threshold will now increase by 26% to cover all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;60,000.  The scheme&rsquo;s lower income thresholds have also been adjusted, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (the previous proposed threshold stood at &euro;22,700).  These increased thresholds will mean that thousands more families will benefit from the new Affordable Childcare Scheme once launched at the end of 2019 and will see their childcare costs tangibly reduce.<\/p>  <p>  It is my view that making these changes is a more progressive use of available resources than merely adjusting the universal element of the scheme. Because of these changes, an estimated additional 8,000 children will be eligible for the scheme for the first time. Another 8,000 will move from a universal subsidy to a higher targeted subsidy. 44,000 other children will continue to access a subsidy, 34,000 of whom will see increases to their subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  The new measures ensure that families with, in some cases, a gross income of &euro;100,000 will benefit from subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  The increase in the lower net income threshold to &euro;26,000 from &euro;22,700 is important in terms of benefitting people at the lower end of the income spectrum. The measure &lsquo;poverty proofs&rsquo; the scheme by ensuring that families at, or below, the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  For those above the net income threshold of &euro;60,000, but with a child under 3 in regulated childcare, the scheme will continue to make up to &euro;1,040 per annum available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600081#WRCC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges Provision","counter":1373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600081#WRCC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1374,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[42294\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600081#WRCC04700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she, through Tusla, will provide for a domestic violence refuge in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area in view of the fact that no such support exists at present for women in the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1375,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence whether in the context of the family or otherwise.

Self-employed persons, who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  The payment of Class S contributions entitles self-employed workers to a range of benefits including State pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  The regulations governing the award of Class S social insurance prescribe that where a self-employed person is assessed as being liable for a compulsory insurance charge, the person is granted a full annual complement of 52 &lsquo;Class-S&rsquo; contributions for that tax year once the liability is discharged (irrespective of whether their self-employment was pursued throughout the year, or if it was just for a portion of the year).  Therefore, in a self-employed person&rsquo;s initial year of assessment of having an insurance liability, on payment of the due amount, the person will be recorded as having paid 52 weekly contributions for that year.<\/p>  <p>  Where the self-employed discharge their combined Income Tax, USC and PRSI liability through Revenue&rsquo;s self-assessed system of collection, a single payment is made in respect of their combined liability for all complete tax years up to and including the year in which the self-employed worker reaches their 65th year. <\/p>  <p>  Such additional (66th year) S Class contributions may be used, where necessary, to satisfy the &lsquo;minimum 520 paid contributions&rsquo; condition for State pension (contributory) eligibility, but cannot be used in the yearly-averaging assessment of pension rate entitlement, for which the cut-off point in totalling contributions is the end date of the immediately preceding (full) tax year.  This is exactly the same &lsquo;66th year&rsquo; approach that is facilitated in the case of standard employees (rather than self-employed) who may require some additional contributions to satisfy the &ldquo;520 contribution&rdquo; condition.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this information is helpful to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600083#WREE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":1439,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600083#WREE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1440,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[41995\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600083#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be addressed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1441,"content":"<p>The gentleman referred to has been awarded invalidity pension with effect from the 14 December 2017.

This Action Plan provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the range of complex issues which need to be addressed across the housing sector.  The Plan is underpinned by over &euro;6 billion in funding to support the delivery of 50,000 new social housing homes and 87,000 other housing supports over the 6 years 2016 to 2021.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made in 2016 and 2017, in partnership with local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and a range of other delivery partners, with over 45,000 individuals and families having their housing needs met during those 2 years, and a further 25,500 households expected to be supported this year. The level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 22%, from 91,600 households to 71,858, between 2016 and 2018. <\/p><p>The Government has made tackling homelessness a key priority under Rebuilding Ireland and while the numbers experiencing homelessness continue to increase and additional measures are required to address emergency accommodation needs, records levels of individuals and families are being supported out of homelessness. 4,729 adults exited homelessness into independent tenancies in 2017 and a further 2,332 in the first half of 2018. A Homeless HAP Place finder service has been made available nationally to support households experiencing homelessness to identify and secure independent tenancies and family hubs have also been introduced to provide more appropriate emergency accommodation to better cater for the needs of families and now provide accommodation for over 500 families. <\/p><p>The number of rough sleepers recorded in April 2018 had reduced by 40%, following the delivery of over 300 additional emergency beds, and a further 150 emergency beds are to be delivered by end-2018. The recent launch of the first national Housing First Strategy provides a strong framework for homeless individuals with the most complex needs to move into independent supported living.  <\/p><p>The recent establishment of the new Land Development Agency under Project Ireland 2040 demonstrates the whole-of-Government response needed to maximise the value and use of lands in public control and to drive a more active land management role by the State. This new Agency will be crucial in supporting the delivery of affordable homes on public lands, through the new affordability requirement whereby a minimum of 30% of all publicly owned lands will be reserved for affordable housing purposes, building on the work that local authorities are initiating to deliver affordable housing on their lands, supported by the &euro;310m Serviced Sites Fund. <\/p><p>New planning guidelines have also been introduced to support increased and more varied delivery of apartments in our main urban centres, where rental pressures are strongest, and a range of measures have been introduced to provide better protections for both tenants and landlords in the rental sector, including longer notice periods and the introduction of an annual limit of 4% on rent increases in areas designated as Rent Pressure Zones. Further measures will be brought forward shortly in new legislation to strengthen the role of the Residential Tenancies Board in enforcing the RPZ provisions, as part of a wider multi-annual change management programme to more proactively enforce tenancy law and have the RTB assume more the role of a regulator within the rental sector.<\/p><p>Recent Central Bank statistics on mortgage arrears show that the level of arrears is declining. There remains, however, a significant number of borrowers in long-term mortgage distress.

In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021.

These UCCs are based on the analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period, and market tender index information. Construction cost is reflective of building costs (including VAT) and also includes normal site works and site development.

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.<\/p>  <p>  Where a dwelling, otherwise not eligible for inclusion in the scheme, adjoins a dwelling already included in the scheme, such a dwelling may be considered in accordance with the exceptional circumstance provisions set out in section 17 of the Act. Section 17 provides that exceptional circumstances may apply where -<\/p>  <p>  - failure to include a dwelling in the scheme may result in damage to that dwelling or damage to the dwelling being remediated under the scheme, or<\/p>  <p>  - pyrite remediation work is causing or may cause damage to a dwelling.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency will consider if exceptional circumstances apply when the Remedial Works Plan is being drawn up and the Board will be informed of any recommendation for a decision in the matter.  To date, one dwelling has been included in the pyrite remediation scheme under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Act. My Department is in regular contact with the Board and the Housing Agency in relation to the implementation of the scheme and is satisfied with the arrangements that are currently in place, including in relation to appeals.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave. The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated. <\/p>  <p>  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave. This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage. <\/p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that a total of 2,179 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme.  Of the 2,179 applications received so far, 1,727 dwellings have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  A further 105 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 214 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process. 133 applications under the scheme were not successful.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 1,727 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme:<\/p>  <p>  - 136 are at remedial works planning stage, <\/p>  <p>  - 106 are at tender \/ tender analysis,<\/p>  <p>  - 248 are under remediation, and  <\/p>  <p>  - 1,237 are complete.<\/p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings in 2018.<\/p>  <p>   A sum of &euro;32 million was announced under Budget 2019 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme next year. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 460 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600085#WRGG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1556,"content":"<p>Question No. 656 answered with Question No. 652.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":1557,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600085#WRGG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1558,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[42135\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600085#WRGG01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when a reply to a letter sent to him on 13 July 2018 and subsequently on 20 August 2018 (details supplied) will issue; the reason for the delay in replying; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1559,"content":"<p>I replied to the Deputy's correspondence on 11 October 2018.

The Government has committed &euro;310 million to support this programme of work, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), as part of Budget 2019. The Exchequer contribution is &euro;275 million with &euro;35 million to be contributed by local authorities. In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p>  <p>  A first call for proposals, under the SSF, issued to local authorities in Dublin; the Greater Dublin Area; Cork and Galway on 29 June 2018. The closing date for applications was 31 August and 15 proposals were received from 9 local authorities. These are currently being assessed and I expect this process to be finalised and an announcement of the first successful bids to be made in the coming weeks.  Further calls for proposals will be made thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Once the funding is awarded and the infrastructure is provided I expect delivery of affordable homes from 2019 onwards. Separately, all local authorities will now carry out an economic assessment of the requirement for affordable housing in their area, and the authorities capacity to deliver housing at affordable prices from their sites. Based on this analysis further local authorities may be considered for funding under the SSF.<\/p>  <p>  I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis some 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, under the recently commenced provisions of Part V of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out more generally. Under the 2009 Act, the maximum discount is 40% of the market value of the home and the local authority takes a charge, equivalent to the discount, against the property. The scheme applies to new homes, and is targeted at single applicants earning up to &euro;50,000 per annum or &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.<\/p>  <p>  This new scheme replaces the time-limited claw-back which applied under the various previous affordable housing schemes.  The local authority will retain a charge equivalent to the discount and the household must recoup the charge at re-sale or during the charge period.

Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision. <\/p>  <p>  The compliance rate with the statutory objective period has been reduced over the past year due to a number of factors. Firstly, there was a reduction in Board capacity in mid-2017, arising from a time interval between the departure of five outgoing Board members, whose terms of office had expired in April and May, and the five new replacement Board members taking up their posts.  While, by September 2017, the Board complement had been fully replenished, this time interval significantly impacted on the Board&rsquo;s case work output over the whole year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also implementing a major ICT strategy which will facilitate the introduction of on-line planning services as part of a complete upgrade and replacement of core systems.  In this regard, a new case management system was installed and became operational in Q4 2017.  As is to be expected with such a fundamental and integrated project, the transition to the new system has caused some initial disruption to the processing of cases, resulting in a further increase in the backlog of cases on hand. However, measures have been put in place to ensure that the new system is bedded down and becomes operational at an optimal level as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore there has been a general increase in cases received by the Board.  For example, there was an increase of almost 12% on normal planning appeals received in 2017 compared to 2016; this upward trend has continued into 2018. The intake of normal planning appeals in the eight months to end-August 2018 was 11% greater than the intake over the corresponding period to end-August 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Now that the Board's full complement has been restored, combined with the measures that are being put in place in relation to the new ICT systems, it is expected that the backlog of cases will begin to reduce over the coming months, with an associated improvement in the compliance rate with the statutory objective period for the determination of cases.<\/p>  <p>  My Department liaises closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources in relation to the performance of its functions. In mid 2017, the Board acquired additional functions in determining planning applications for strategic housing developments.

The cost of the schemes in future years is therefore dependent on the number of new social housing homes and tenancies falling to be funded within each of the schemes and the rental or lease payments involved.<\/p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) is a funding programme that supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners and developers. <\/p><p>The SHCEP budget funds the ongoing current costs of homes delivered using a variety of different delivery mechanisms, including properties built or acquired by AHBs using funding under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) and leased to local authorities; properties leased on a longterm basis from private property owners by AHBs or local authorities, including properties secured through specific programmes such as the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) and the Enhanced Leasing Scheme. Therefore, SHCEP is a complementary funding stream to a range of capital expenditure programmes like RLS, CALF and the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.<\/p><p>The 2019 budgetary provision for the SHCEP is &euro;155 million which represents an increase of &euro;40 million on the 2018 provision. This is expected to fund the ongoing cost of the existing social housing homes secured with support of the Programme at the end of 2018 which will amount to almost 14,000.

For completeness: I am also advised that, during the period 2015-2017, appointments were made at Principal Officer level following external recruitment in the National Museum of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art,  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta,  and the Crawford Art Gallery.<table><tr><th>Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht:<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017 <\/th><th>2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>No. of Principal Officer appointments arising   from internal competitions since 7\/7\/15<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4 <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>No. of Principal Officer appointments arising from 2015 PO Open competition run by PAS (Campaign ID: 1512210) (Effective 7\/7\/15)<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>No. of Principal Officer appointments arising from 2017 PO Open competition run by PAS(Campaign ID: 17101202) (Effective 23\/11\/17)<\/td><td><\/td><td>0<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600086#WRHH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foras na Gaeilge","counter":1623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600086#WRHH03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1624,"qnumday":682,"qnumall":"[42120\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600086#WRHH03700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil s&iacute; ar an eolas go bhfuil go leor oibrithe i bhForas na Gaeilge, at&aacute; ar ph&aacute; laghdaithe ar threoir a Roinne, nach bhfuil ar Aguis&iacute;n 2A de Chiorcl&aacute;n 22\/2017, c&eacute; gur fosta&iacute;odh iad i ndiaidh 1995 at&aacute; ag &iacute;oc &Aacute;SPC d&rsquo;aicme A agus at&aacute; ag &iacute;oc pinsin; agus an dtabharfaidh s&iacute; treoir don Roinn na hoibrithe cu&iacute; ar Aguis&iacute;n 2A a &iacute;oc l&aacute;ithreach agus socr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun na h&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; siarghabh&aacute;lacha a bhaineann leis seo agus a th&eacute;ann siar na blianta a r&eacute;iteach freisin.","asker":"1235","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1625,"content":"<p>I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba choir dom a mh&iacute;ni&uacute; go mbaineann ceisteanna maidir le p&aacute; fostaithe Fhoras na Gaeilge le c&uacute;ins&iacute; oibr&iacute;ocht&uacute;la inmhe&aacute;nacha na h&aacute;is&iacute;neachta. <\/p>  <p>  Tuigtear dom go mbaineann Ciorcl&aacute;n 22\/2017 le st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh agus, ag brath ar a gc&uacute;ins&iacute;, d'fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; nach mbaineann s&eacute; le comhlachta&iacute; St&aacute;it eile.  <\/p>  <p>  Ar nd&oacute;igh, n&iacute; hionann socruithe p&aacute; agus pinsin na st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;se agus socruithe do na forais trasteorann, ag eascairt as a st&aacute;das uath&uacute;il ag fost&uacute; foirne sa d&aacute; dhl&iacute;nse.

The Arts Council provides a range of schemes and initiatives for the development of young artists including the Next Generation artists award which aims to support promising artists across all disciplines at an early but pivotal stage in their career.  Recipients can receive &euro;20,000 and take part in a collective week-long residential programme in spring 2018.  The Arts Council also funds bursary awards to artists.

Participation and citizen engagement in creative activity is at the heart of the Programme.

The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government also provide funding of &euro;1m towards this element of the Programme.

In addition to this over &euro;2m has been provided by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills to implement the measures set out in Creative Youth &ndash; the plan to enable the creative potential of every child and young person.

Every year, as part of this on-going management of deer populations within the Park, deer numbers may need to be reduced. Culls in Killarney are undertaken following consideration of a number of reports, population surveys and scientific advise. The cull in Killarney is carried out by trained, experienced and dedicated NPWS staff in a professional manner and is based upon scientific research. As part of this managed process, some 120 deer have culled since January 2018. It is not possible to estimate how many more deer will be culled in 2018 due to weather and other factors. The following points should be noted:<\/p>  <p>  - The 2018 cull was decided upon following consultation with NPWS professional staff, including scientific input as required.<\/p>  <p>  - Shooting of deer in the Park is carried out only by NPWS professional staff members, who are fully trained, competent, expert and licenced in the use of firearms.<\/p>  <p>  - The selection of deer shot is in accordance with normal deer management protocols. The deer are shot humanely by qualified NPWS marksmen.<\/p>  <p>  - The remains are processed and disposed of in full compliance with the applicable Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine guidelines, and with the involvement, as appropriate, of officials from that Department.<\/p>  <p>  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.  Ultimately, however, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats (especially woodland), culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600087#WRJJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":1650,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[42366\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600087#WRJJ01800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that there is considerable concern regarding unnecessary vilification of wild deer which is not based on factual scientific data and that some wildlife crimes against wild deer have been committed and reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":1651,"qnumday":694,"qnumall":"[42367\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600087#WRJJ01900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans to make adjustments to the open season for wild deer; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":1652,"qnumday":695,"qnumall":"[42368\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101600087#WRJJ02000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will meet with an organisation (details supplied) to discuss the issue in relation to deer management and conservation here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1653,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 693, 694 and 695 together.<\/p>  <p>  Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts.
