CETA is designed to benefit EU and Canadian companies through improved trade flows in support of increased employment for our citizens.  The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures that flow from CETA all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada and vice versa.  Outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market with more than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients doing business in the Canadian market employing over 6,000 people.<\/p><p>Diversifying trade is an important part of our Brexit response and it will be an important factor in our recovery post-pandemic.  To this end, the best way to achieve export growth and market diversification is by improving market access and reducing costs of entering those markets which is what CETA is designed to achieve.  Given our historic ties with Canada, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to benefit from CETA.<\/p><p>The main benefits for Ireland in this Agreement include:<\/p><p>the opening up of public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing;<\/p><p>unlimited tariff-free access for most of our important food exports;<\/p><p>a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area; and<\/p><p>the recognition of product standards and certification, saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the benefits and opportunities to business in the Agreement will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  Indeed, CETA contains an entire chapter exclusively dedicated to SMEs aimed at ensuring they can take full advantage of the improved market access.<\/p><p>In services and investment, CETA is the most far-reaching agreement the EU has ever concluded. Almost half of the benefits anticipated from CETA are expected in the services sector where CETA makes it easier for EU individuals and companies to provide services to Canadian customers and vice versa.  It covers services such as legal, accountancy, transport and telecoms and there are significant opportunities for Ireland given its strengths in services, with services exports accounting for approximately 60% of all exports in 2019.<\/p><p>CETA has provisionally applied across the EU since the 21st September 2017 which has allowed us to see the practical benefits of this Agreement.  Exports of Irish goods and services to Canada totalled approximately &euro;3.9 billion in 2019 a 35% increase compared to 2016, the last full year, prior to the provisional application of CETA.  Furthermore, the cost of service barriers to trade will, on average, be reduced under CETA by 10 per cent in Canada and by 4 per cent in the EU.  The benefits and opportunities to business in the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs) - in areas such as regulatory co-operation, trade facilitation measures, streamlined administration etc., will directly benefit Irish consumers.  <\/p><p>To date, 15 Member States have signalled to the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union the completion of their respective national ratification procedures while several other Member States are currently progressing approval of the Agreement.  Ireland, like many Member States, was awaiting the opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding the compatibility of CETA with EU law prior to our commencing the formal ratification process for Ireland.  <\/p><p>The Opinion of the Court in Case 1\/17 was issued on 30th April 2019 and held that the dispute settlement mechanism in CETA is compatible with EU law and complies with (i) the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, (ii) the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, and (iii) the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular of the right of access to a court and right to an independent and impartial tribunal under the Charter.  The Opinion of the CJEU, allowed Member States to proceed with domestic ratification, according to the requirements of their national law.<\/p><p>International trade agreements are not part of domestic law so this is why separate adjudication arrangements are required in the event of disputes under the Agreement.  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements. Moreover, where such agreements cover investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments e.g. Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS).<\/p><p>ISDS which has been in existence since the 1950s, enables overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where their investment is made through binding international arbitration.  ISDS has been included in more than 2,000 investment treaties but has proved controversial in recent times and is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission.  In this regard, the Irish Government considered the European Commission was right to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding ISDS in seeking to develop a new replacement mechanism &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS) &ndash; to address concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interest - and ICS is the Investment Dispute Settlement system incorporated in CETA. <\/p><p>Investors may utilise either national courts or the ICS, but cannot &quot;forum-shop&quot;.  Equally, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can seek to sue the government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our Courts whether CETA exists or not.  CETA simply provides an arbitration alternative.  That alternative, unlike a challenge in the Courts, cannot find any act by Government to be <i>ultra vires<\/i>or unconstitutional - it is only concerned with redress for proven harm.<\/p><p>ICS addressees the concerns around the old ISDS system through:<\/p><p>- Greater transparency &ndash; hearings will be open and comments available on-line, and a right to intervene for parties with an interest in the dispute will be provided;<\/p><p>- Safeguards to prevent forum-shopping;<\/p><p>- Provisions for the swift dismissal of Frivolous claims should they arise;<\/p><p>- The maintenance of a clear distinction between international law and domestic law;<\/p><p>- The avoidance of Multiple and parallel proceedings in the ICS and National Courts, and;<\/p><p>- The establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators.<\/p><p>The reforms to investment protection mean the ICS will involve: <\/p><p>- a public Investment Court System composed of a first instance Tribunal and an Appeal Tribunal;<\/p><p>- the establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators with qualifications &ndash; comparable to those required for the members of permanent international courts, from which members will be selected to hear individual cases.<\/p><p>- precise limitations on the ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal.<\/p><p>Under CETA the right of EU Member States (and Canada) to regulate for public policies (e.g. in health, environment, security) is fully preserved, and it is made clear that the deal does not imply an expectation that public policies will remain unchanged.  Further, an investor&rsquo;s loss of profits will not be sufficient grounds for making a claim against a Government.  Any claim must be based on discriminatory and unfair treatment. <\/p><p>Finally, Ireland has been a beneficiary of significant levels of Foreign Direct Investment or FDI for many decades with more and more Irish enterprises also making overseas investments in key markets in recent years.  An Investment Protection Agreement, such as the ICS model in CETA, is, therefore, a key plank of assisting in the ongoing free-flow of mobile FDI making the EU and Ireland a more attractive location for mobile Canadian FDI than other Third Countries where Canadian Investors would not have available to them the protections that such an Agreement provides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300054#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300054#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[44783\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300054#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his Department or State agencies under the aegis of his Department have awarded contracts to a company (details supplied); if so, the value of such contracts; if the contracts were tendered for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is seeking details of any contracts with the company in question during the last five years.<\/p><p>My Department has not had any contracts with the company during this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300054#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300054#WRB04200"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[44854\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300054#WRB04300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the Covid-19 related supports taxi drivers can avail of to cover the high costs of insurance considering that their revenues were severely affected in 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and shutdown of the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>As part of Budget 2021, my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, and Transport, Eamon Ryan TD is introducing specific measures for taxi and hackney businesses.

The report, &quot;The economic and distributional impacts of an increased carbon tax with different revenue recycling schemes,&rdquo; published on 8 October 2019, found that an incremental increase in the carbon tax reaching &euro;80 per tonne in 2030, would help reduce economy-wide emissions by approximately 15% in 2030, compared to no increase in the carbon tax. <\/p><p>Building on this work, my Department commissioned further research in 2020 from the ESRI to examine the distributional benefits of utilising carbon tax receipts, including the impact of retrofitting on alleviating fuel poverty. As part of this programme of work, and on foot of a specific commitment in the Programme for Government, the ESRI published a report entitled, &quot;Carbon taxes, poverty and compensation options,&quot; on 13 October 2020. The report identified a series of targeted direct social protection payment interventions that could be used to address the effects an increase in the price of fossil fuels would have on lower income households and examined the effect of each of these.In addition to raising the level of carbon tax by &euro;7.50 per tonne, the Government committed, in Budget 2021, to significant increases in a targeted package of social protection supports. These supports were selected to address the impact of the increased carbon tax, as identified by the ESRI in the report referred to above. The specific measures are:<\/p><p>- an increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12, and &euro;5 per week for children over 12; <\/p><p>- an increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;5 per week; and <\/p><p>- an increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;3.50 per week.<\/p><p>The total cost of these interventions is expected to reach an estimated &euro;153.5m in 2021. This will be part-funded by receipts from the increased carbon tax of &euro;48m, with the remaining &euro;105.5m cost to be funded by general Exchequer receipts. The analysis suggests that households in the first five income deciles will see increases in their disposable income as a result of these measures. <\/p><p>Further information on these is measures is available on www.budget.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300057#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300057#WRE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[1605\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300057#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the funding provided by the gum industry on an annual basis to assist with the cost of its removal; the corresponding figure for the tobacco industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>Under the terms of an\u00a0agreement with the Department in April 2018 the gum\u00a0industry committed to spending\u00a0&euro;10.2m\u00a0up to\u00a02020 on awareness raising activities relating to the\u00a0disposal of their products.

The supports are targeted at those classes of bus services where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention, in line with relevant state aid considerations. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering the funding support through contracts with the relevant operators.<\/p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment which operators can avail of and which remains open to new applicants until the end of March 2021 and a Covid-19 enterprise support grant which can be put towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. <\/p>  <p>  Other measures introduced includes rates waivers, lending facilities, equity injection and business advisory supports, all of which will help to improve cash flow. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.<\/p>  <p>  Concerning coach tourism - a fund of &euro;10m was made available under the July Stimulus package to assist the Coach Tourism sector.

In 2019 about half of transport carbon emissions originated from the passenger car fleet, while the heavy and light duty freight sectors together accounted for about a further 26% of Irish land transport emissions. Public transport (bus, rail and taxi) vehicles were responsible for approximately 4.5% of transport emissions.<\/p>  <p>  Maximum impact in emission savings can therefore be achieved in the private car and freight sectors, by promoting a shift away from higher emitting and more polluting vehicles and fuels towards zero or low emission alternatives, and by assisting citizens to make the switch to active travel (walking and cycling). The transition of the public transport fleet (including buses, heavy rail and the taxi sector) to low-emitting technologies also plays a significant leadership and demonstration role in reducing emissions, in normalising alternative transport technologies, and in reducing air and noise pollutant emissions, particularly in Ireland&rsquo;s towns and cities. <\/p>  <p>  Given the complexities of the sector, and the varying maturity-levels of low emitting technologies for different vehicle types and uses, no single technology holds the key to the decarbonisation of transport. A range of technologies and strategies will be required to meet emissions reduction targets and to transition Irish transport to cleaner, more sustainable alternatives.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a range of instruments and strategies to assist the necessary transition of the transport sector to sustainable alternatives. Underpinning all of these is the Government&rsquo;s recognition that clean mobility strategies require technical, evidence-based and innovative solutions. As Ireland is largely a transport technology taker, my Department is also monitoring international and national developments in emerging low and zero-emission technologies, such as the potential future role of renewable hydrogen in transport, and the recent European Commission call for participation in a study on potential emission reduction through the retrofitting of existing passenger cars and vans.<\/p>  <p>  Given the urgency of reducing emissions from the transport sector, my Department welcomes the development and implementation of such technologies and initiatives. Where such technologies involve the modification of existing vehicles, due consideration must, of course, be given to the safety and effectiveness of any modifications. Vehicle owners or operators must also meet their legal obligation to ensure that their vehicle is maintained in a roadworthy condition, regardless of the system of propulsion or the fuel used. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department plays an important role providing start-ups with advice and support.

The RSA has begun the recruitment process with the Public Appointments Service.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who I previously gave sanction to rehire during 2020. <\/p>  <p>  These measures will help to increase testing capacity.\u00a0 However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased. Any decision on this matter will be guided by health protocols. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time, which is around ten weeks.\u00a0 It is clear that it will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic.\u00a0 It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has also had a profound effect on the delivery of the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s driver theory testing services and a significant backlog has developed.\u00a0 \u00a0Under current level 5 restrictions, the driver theory test has not been deemed to be an essential service. As a consequence, the service is closed while level 5 restrictions remain in place.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The driver theory test service has seen its capacity reduced\u00a0significantly to comply with occupational and public health requirements.\u00a0The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests while adhering to occupational and public health requirements for when servicers are resumed. In this regard, they would, for example,\u00a0be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours\u00a0also\u00a0provided to allow additional capacity for appointments. Much like\u00a0the driver testing service, it will take time for the\u00a0theory test service to return to normal waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused by the necessity to adhere to the restrictions, the safety of the public must be of paramount importance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300059#WRG04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300059#WRG04800"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[1062\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300059#WRG04900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount BusConnects, both the network and the corridor projects, has cost the State to date including contractors and so on; if the BusConnects project can continue before a full review of the greater Dublin area transport strategy has been completed in view of changed travel and commuting practices following Covid-19; and if the deadline can be extended for the public consultation period given that lockdown restrictions have been in place for most of the consultation period.","asker":"1555","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>I\u00a0believe that Dubliners deserve an expanded and improved public transport network and that our publicly subvented bus system is, and will continue to be, at the heart of that network. <\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the current restrictions have changed travel demand patterns but obviously those restrictions are imposed upon people in light of the ongoing public health emergency.

However, if a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  Where a declaration is not made in advance, arrears of motor tax, if applicable, must be paid in full and motor tax paid for a minimum of 3 months before a declaration of non-use\u00a0can then\u00a0be made in the final month of the tax disc.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans\u00a0to\u00a0re-introduce retrospective declarations of non-use or to otherwise provide for the waiving of arrears of motor tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300059#WRG07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300060#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[1140\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300060#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the plan in place to deal with the driver theory test backlog; and if remote options or staggered examinations have been considered.","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>Covid-19 has had a profound effect on the delivery of the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s driver theory testing services and a significant backlog has developed.\u00a0 \u00a0Under current level 5 restrictions, the driver theory test has not been deemed to be an essential service.

To fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking in Ireland (or in any other EU Member State) must have a nominated Transport Manager who resides in the EU to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities. The Transport Manager must hold a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC), in either Road Haulage or Road Passenger Transport depending on the nature of the operator's business. This certificate must be issued by an EU Member State and is ordinarily obtained by passing a written examination. <\/p>  <p>  As highlighted by the European Commission in 2018, and more recently in July 2020, with the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020, Transport Manager CPCs issued by an authority of the United Kingdom or a body authorised by the United Kingdom are no longer valid in the EU. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, my Department carried out a review and identified approximately 200 individuals with a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC nominated as Transport Manager for Irish road transport operators. This Department (rather than the RSA) wrote to these Transport Managers and the relevant operators to ensure that they were aware of the position as outlined by the European Commission.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department liaised with the European Commission on this matter and received clarification at the end of November 2020 that a corresponding Irish Transport Manager CPC could be issued to those UK-qualified individuals working for Irish operators, before the end of the Brexit transition period. <\/p>  <p>  In view of this clarification, my Department established arrangements with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) for the application process to obtain a corresponding Irish Transport Manager CPC.\u00a0 CILT is the body that issues Transport Manager CPCs in Ireland on behalf of the Department of Transport. A further communication issued at the start of December 2020 to affected Transport Managers to outline how to apply for an Irish Transport Manager CPC.\u00a0 This means that such Transport Managers making the necessary application before the end of the Brexit transition period are not required to undertake an Irish examination in order to continue to work as Transport Manager for an Irish or other EU operator.\u00a0 It is important to note that, in line with the Commission&rsquo;s clarification, applications were to be submitted to CILT by 31 December 2020, as after that date it is not possible to obtain an Irish Transport Manager CPC on the basis of holding a UK certificate. The Department emphasised this clearly in its communications to affected Transport Managers. This position was also outlined to the Deputy on 1 December, in the recent reply to PQ number 40449\/20. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300060#WRH03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300060#WRH03800"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[1291\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300060#WRH03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the stricter enforcement measures that can be taken to protect public transport staff during the latest Covid-19 surge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.

The implementation of the Action Plan will be overseen by the Sub-Group on Insurance Reform within the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment.  The Action Plan includes actions to be brought forward by my Department, as well as the Departments of Justice and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, over the next 18 months. <\/p>  <p>  Some of the key measures under the Action Plan are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - increasing market transparency following the publication of the second private motor report of the National Claims Information Database (NCID), and the planned expansion of the scope of the NCID to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - reviewing the duty of care legislation;<\/p>  <p>  - providing for the Judicial Council's accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum;<\/p>  <p>  - consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission's recent Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions;<\/p>  <p>  - looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; and,<\/p>  <p>  - making proposals on insurance competition via the recently-established Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market.<\/p>  <p>  It might also be of interest to the Deputy to note that, in addition to this work, there was a round of intensive engagement with key stakeholders in relation to the Government's insurance reform agenda.

More recently, he has also concluded a series of meetings with the main insurers in the Irish market and he has written to the CEOs of the main insurance companies operating in the Irish market seeking their views on a range of issues. The Deputy can be assured that there will continue to be engagement with these various stakeholders throughout 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key priority issue for this Government.

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. <\/p><p>Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: .<\/p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &quot;business premises&quot; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. <\/p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, such as a haulage business that ordinarily operates from mobile vehicles, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS. Similarly, a business such as a photographer or videographer that provides its services at events, including weddings, at different venues will not meet the eligibility criteria. <\/p><p>I have also previously indicated that an on-course bookmaker operating from a mobile premises or a premises not permanently fixed in place, such as a stand at a racecourse, is not operating from a business premises for the purposes of CRSS and therefore is not eligible to make a claim under the scheme. The Deputies will also appreciate that outdoor activity businesses, by their very nature, generally do not provide services in premises to which access is restricted. Therefore, they are not eligible for the CRSS and I have no plans to change this. In the same way, camping and caravan operations are not eligible for the CRSS. <\/p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or restrict access to its business premises.<\/p><p>The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions. Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.<\/p><p>The purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations.  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300061#WRJ05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300061#WRJ06000"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[1028\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300061#WRJ06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to applying a tax credit (details supplied) to persons who retrofit homes for energy efficiency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the introduction of any new tax expenditure measures would arise in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill process.

Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.<\/p><p>Proposals for tax expenditure measures should be assessed in accordance with my department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  Drawing on economic evidence, these make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. <\/p><p>The proposal for a domestic retrofit tax incentive was explored by my officials in a Tax Strategy Group paper on Climate Action and Tax, published in July 2019 (available at ).<\/p><p>The paper observed that:<\/p><p>- In terms of current direct expenditure measures in the energy efficiency sector, the Government continues to make grants available to householders who wish to improve the energy efficiency of their home through the SEAI's Better Energy Homes (BEH) and Deep retrofit Grant programme.<\/p><p>- Recent research undertaken by the ESRI into householder preferences regarding retrofit subsidy schemes found that households strongly prefer cash payment subsidies (i.e. up-front discounts or cash back post works) versus other indirect methods of financial support (e.g. tax credits). <\/p><p>- From an equity perspective, tax expenditure measures can be regressive by nature, given that only those who pay taxes qualify, and those with greatest income benefit the most. As such, a tax incentive measure as proposed may be of little benefit to certain groups who are most likely to suffer from energy poverty, for example the elderly or those on limited incomes. <\/p><p>- The Home Renovation Incentive (the tax measure on which the proposal was based) expired on 31 December 2018 following an ex-post analysis of the scheme. The review found that in the context of the current housing supply shortage, and the need at that time to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there was a risk that the retrofit scheme could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The review concluded that the potential for displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations would create a high opportunity cost of labour associated with HRI which was not present at the inception of the scheme. Given the continued constraints on the construction sector's ability to hire labour to deliver a supply of new housing units, similar issues may arise with regard to the introduction of this proposed tax based measure.<\/p><p>Having regard to these considerations, the case for introducing a tax measure along the lines mentioned by the Deputy is not a strong one from the perspective of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300061#WRJ06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living City Initiative","counter":577,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300061#WRJ06300"},{"type":"question","counter":578,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[1164\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300061#WRJ06400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount allocated annually to date to the Dublin City Council living city initiative; and the details of future expansion of funding and the geographic remit within Dublin city as facilitated by departmental funding.","asker":"1570","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":579,"content":"<p>The Living City Initiative (LCI) was provided for in Finance Act 2013 and commenced on 5th May 2015.

Specific criteria were set down in respect of the areas which should be included within the remit of the LCI which were required to be taken into account by the relevant city councils when putting forward the proposed Special Regeneration Areas for each city. In particular, it was stated that the Special Regeneration Areas should be inner city areas which are largely comprised of dwellings built before 1915, where there is above average unemployment and which demonstrate clear evidence of neglect, dereliction and under-use. It was specified that areas which are generally regarded as affluent, have high occupancy rates and which do not require regeneration should not be included in the Special Regeneration Areas. I have no plans at present to amend the zones. <\/p><p>Officials in my Department reviewed the Living City Initiative in 2016 in consultation with the relevant councils and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. On foot of that review, a number of changes were brought forward to the scheme in Budget 2017 in order to make the initiative more attractive and effective. The principal change extended the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who are now able to claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property, which was built prior to 1915, where such property is to be used for residential purposes. In addition, the requirement for a pre-1915 building to have been originally constructed for use as a dwelling in order to qualify for the residential element of the Initiative was removed. The floor area restriction for owner-occupiers has also been removed, while the minimum amount of capital expenditure required for eligibility for relief, under all elements of the scheme, was also amended and must now only exceed &euro;5,000. <\/p><p>The aim is to get the design of the Initiative right so that it can work in an effective manner. Once it is clear that this have been achieved, it will then be possible to consider if and how the Initiative might be extended to other locations.

An example of this is that routine dental treatment does not attract the relief, though orthodontic treatment would. <\/p>  <p>  Consistent with this rationale, tax relief in respect of qualifying health expenses is provided for in section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  <\/p>  <p>  Routine dental treatment is explicitly excluded under the legislation and is defined as \"the extraction, scaling and filling of teeth and the provision and repairing of artificial teeth or dentures\".<\/p>  <p>  However, an individual can claim tax relief in respect of non-routine dental care provided by a registered practitioner.  A comprehensive and indeed non-exhaustive list of relevant procedures is available on the Revenue website.  This list includes major interventions such as periodontal treatment for gum disease and orthodontic treatment to provide braces. <\/p>  <p>  The exclusion of expenses incurred in respect of routine dental treatment has been in place since the relief's inception in 1967 and I am satisfied that the legislation as drafted and implemented provides sufficient flexibility for expenses that should qualify.  There are no plans to change these arrangements at this time.  <\/p>  <p>  In this regard I note that tax relief for medical expenses is a commonly availed of relief &ndash; the most data from 2018 highlights that 522,800 taxpayer units utilised the relief at an Exchequer cost of &euro;156m.<\/p>  <p>  If routine dental expenses, such as dentures, were tax relieved, it would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief.  This could greatly increase the overall cost of the tax relief and given the current challenging fiscal environment, I am not predisposed to such a potential cost increase. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy will be aware that in recent years there has been an increase in the level of dental benefits available through the social insurance system administered by the Department of Social Protection.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been advised by Revenue that, from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.\u00a0\u00a0There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.<\/p>  <p>  The question as to how cohabiting couple are treated for the purposes of social welfare payments is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300062#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Interest Rates","counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300062#WRK03100"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[44859\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300062#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to bring forward proposals to introduce a market wide cap on interest rates charged by licensed moneylenders; if he is considering legislative changes to the operation and regulation of the moneylending sector based on the submissions received in response to the consultation exercise entitled capping the cost of licensed moneylenders and other public matters commenced by his Department in May 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":618,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance undertook a\u00a0public consultation in 2019 seeking views on capping the cost of licensed moneylenders and other regulatory matters in relation to moneylending.

In relation to the particular issue of new\u00a0mortgage lending, the\u00a0main retail banks\u00a0previously confirmed that they\u00a0are\u00a0considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their\u00a0customers who were on the\u00a0Employment\u00a0Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and\u00a0that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19.  Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.\u00a0 For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.\u00a0 Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an\u00a0application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm.  If the mortgage applicant\u00a0is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she\u00a0can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300062#WRK06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":646,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300062#WRK06100"},{"type":"question","counter":647,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[45177\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300062#WRK06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":648,"content":"<p>The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive, is a scheme to assist first-time purchasers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up\u00a0to three months and then subsequently extended for\u00a0up to six months. The implementation of\u00a0this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a\u00a0flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break ended were given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. On 30 November last, the BPFI reported that approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% returned on reduced repayments. <\/p><p>On the question of whether new payment breaks can be put in place, the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.\u00a0 The BPFI has also reiterated in recent days that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.<\/p><p>SME-borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations.\u00a0The SME Regulations set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.<\/p><p>In addition, Credit Review was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.<\/p><p>Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that\u00a0lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers\u00a0in a timely manner\u00a0in line with\u00a0regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the Central Credit Register does not produce credit scores; rather the information on a credit report provided by the Central Credit Register is factual in nature and the information is provided to the Central Credit Register by lenders. It contains no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit or repayment arrangements agreed with borrowers. Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites. <\/p><p>I\u00a0will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300062#WRK06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":655,"content":"<p>Question No. 236 answered with Question No. 203.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300063#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[1182\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300063#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year yield from each 1.5% increase in the minimum effective tax rate of persons earning over &euro;150,000 per year.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>The High Income Individuals' Restriction (HIIR), provided for in Section 485C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, limits the use of specified reliefs in calculating a taxpayer&rsquo;s taxable income.

For example, where it is not possible for a taxpayer to pay the arrears up-front, it will be automatically collected over four years from January 2022 (interest free) by reducing the person&rsquo;s future tax credits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300063#WRL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300063#WRL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[1655\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300063#WRL03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 264 of 24 November 2020, the reason a review was requested; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":694,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[1656\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300063#WRL04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of reviews of primary medical certificates requested by the Revenue Commissioners in 2018, 2019 and 2020; the number of reviews which resulted in the removal of primary medical certificates in each year; the reason such reviews are requested; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":695,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 253 together.<\/p><p>As advised to the Deputy in my previous replies on this issue, Revenue routinely reviews the tax affairs of persons in receipt of tax reliefs, including those who avail of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers scheme.

In early December 2020, and as the public health restriction at the time began to ease and businesses reopen, Revenue confirmed that the concessionary measure related to employer-provided vehicles would cease to apply on\u00a031 December 2020 and, with effect from 1 January 2021, BIK on same should be calculated in the usual manner. \u00a0<\/p><p>However, since then, Level 5 public health restrictions have been subsequently introduced. On 24 December 2020, all restaurants, caf&eacute;s and gastro pubs as well as personal services, such as hairdressers, beauticians and barbers closed, while hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;amp;Bs remain open but are restricted to essential non-social and non-tourist services only. Additionally, on 31 December all non-essential retail as well as gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools closed. For employees, the public health advice is to work from home in all instances unless work is an essential health, social care or other essential service that cannot be done from home.\u00a0<\/p><p>Having regard to the current public health restrictions, the short-term concessionary measures announced back in March will remain in place. This means that, for the time being: \u00a0<\/p><p>- Where an employer takes back possession of the vehicle and an employee has no access to the vehicle, no BIK shall apply for the period.\u00a0<\/p><p>- Where an employee retains possession of a vehicle, but the employer prohibits the use of the vehicle, no BIK shall apply if the vehicle is not used for private use. \u00a0<\/p><p>- Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited its use and no such use has occurred, for example communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer,\u00a0etc.<\/p><p>- Where an employee has a car provided by his or her employer and\u00a0<\/p><p>1. the circumstances in the previous example don&rsquo;t apply,<\/p><p>2. limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken due to the COVID-19 crisis, and<\/p><p>3. personal use is limited<\/p><p>the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of BIK due. Thus, the percentage applied in the calculation of the cash equivalent, which is based on annualised business mileage, may have regard to the actual business mileage for January 2020, for the current period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Appropriate records should be kept, for example business mileage travelled in January, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer etc.\u00a0<\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s website will shortly be updated accordingly.\u00a0<\/p><p>Due to the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic it is not known how long any COVID-19 restrictions will ultimately remain in place.

Coupled with the known work and estimated timeframe for each stage, are respective potential risks that are carefully managed, but by their nature can extend time and require allowances for reasonable budget increases. <\/p><p>Construction budgets are closely monitored in the context of the tendered contract price. The Public Works Contract Form 3, Public Works Contract for Civil Engineering Works (PW-CF3) is used for construction of flood relief schemes. These contracts are priced based primarily on a fixed price lump sum basis (based on the known &lsquo;Works Requirements&rsquo; at tender stage). <\/p><p>Some of the risks include unforeseen ground conditions, which can be assessed at a high level by means of site investigation works conducted to inform a scheme&rsquo;s design. These investigations, however, are constrained as the lands are often privately owned, and flood relief schemes can extend over long stretches and in built-up areas with varying ground conditions. Therefore, the nature of flood relief works, adjacent to river and\/or the sea, means that ground conditions cannot be fully known at the commencement of the construction phase. The scope of construction can evolve as schemes are being built, informed, for example, by agreements reached with landowners. These negotiations may necessarily change elements of the design or alter planned scheme finishes. During construction, other unforeseen issues may also arise, including for example archaeological finds. <\/p><p>Given the associated risks during construction of a flood relief scheme, variations to the Works set out at tender for design and construction are inevitably necessary during the course of construction. The OPW actively manages these claims but experience is that incorporating variations during the contract can sometimes be complex and often result in disputes being referred to conciliation, leading to additional costs.<\/p><p>The OPW actively monitors expenditure for each scheme against contract costs and total project budget. The value for money of flood relief schemes is also monitored using a benefit to cost ratio.<\/p><p>There was also one\u00a0Estate Management Contracts pertaining to the historic Leinster House in Dublin that exceeded the tender value by 20%.\u00a0 The agreed tender price was &euro;12.82 million.\u00a0 The final amount paid was &euro;16.4 million<b><\/b>exceeding the contract price by 28%.\u00a0 The excess arose as additional time was required to carry out additional work (at the same tender rates) which only came to light during the contract.\u00a0 These previously hidden building elements could not have been reasonably foreseen or surveyed prior to contract placement, as the building was in full occupation by the Houses of the Oireachtas.\u00a0 The unforeseen works included significant cracking in internal walls, structurally unstable chimney flues, hidden structural roof defects, poor quality stone and stonework, additional structural works and fireproofing to floors, additional works to plaster ceilings, additional supports for chandeliers and lanterns, additional services and related builders work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300064#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform Review","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300064#WRM02400"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[45054\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300064#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to measure compatibility of private sector experience and allow it to be carried over into the public sector,  including in the health service.","asker":"1467","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>Government policy continues to be that starting pay on recruitment from open competition for all posts within the public service should be at the minimum of the relevant salary scale and should not be subject to negotiation.

","asker":"1497","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":805,"content":"<p>I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music on our broadcasting services. Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world. As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am keen to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to further nurture and protect this sector.<\/p>  <p>  However,\u00a0I am conscious of the legal and other\u00a0factors which must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing airplay quotas. The potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue particularly in the context of the current media climate. Importantly, the introduction of airplay quotas would need to be consistent with EU law.<\/p>  <p>  An example of airplay quotas in the EU can be seen in France. In 1994, France introduced a mandatory quota for 40% airplay of French language music on French radio stations, this quota was reduced to 35% in 2016. \u00a0Any quota for airplay would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music meeting certain criteria in a more advantaged position.\u00a0 However, a quota for airplay of music in a particular language, as is the case in France, can be justified under EU case law, as the preservation and promotion of an official language of a Member State constitutes a general interest objective. Unlike music in a particular language, a quota system for music produced in a particular place, as suggested in this question, does not appear to have grounds for exemption from the general requirements of EU law.\u00a0 Therefore, without a similar justification on the grounds of linguistic protection,\u00a0a quota for music produced in a particular Member State would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music produced in other Member States at a disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  Given the legal challenges arising, the Government is not currently considering airplay quotas based on production location.\u00a0 I will however continue to support Irish musicians and musical content, though initiatives within my Department and through funding for the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the state body through which the Government funds the arts, including music, in Ireland. Arts Council funding has increased from &euro;80m at the beginning of last year to &euro;130m this year &ndash; an increase of over 60%. I also provided significant targeted funding last year for music and musicians including very successful national events - Other Voices: Courage, the Hot Press Young and Emerging series, Ireland Performs and the Music Industry Stimulus Package. A very significant proportion of over &euro;5m allocated to the Live Performance Support Scheme was allocated to musicians. In 2021, the Government has allocated &euro;50m for live performance. These benefits are over and above economy wide supports, principally the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. My Department will continue to engage with the sector to tailor supports to the needs of musicians and other artists. I appointed a number of musicians to the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce.<\/p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the challenges faced by the live music sector as a result of necessary public health restrictions.

One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate\u00a0more widespread generation of energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review, which continues to be shaped by recommendations of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.<\/p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for \"glint and glare\" impacts for aircraft from solar panels erected in proximity to airports and aerodromes and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly,\u00a0my Department is presently engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport\/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. As such, these maps, which are a fundamental aspect of any amendments to the exemptions, are expected to be finalised in Q3 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. The draft regulations will also be subject to environmental assessment reporting considerations before being finalised and signed into force. The overall process for revising the solar panel planning exemptions is now expected to be completed by Q4 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300067#WRP06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety","counter":994,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300067#WRP06900"},{"type":"question","counter":995,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[1373\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300067#WRP07000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the way his Department can assist the residents of a complex (details supplied) in meeting the cost of fire safety remediation in their apartment complex; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":996,"content":"<p>Firstly, I wish to acknowledge the very stressful circumstances which the owners and residents of buildings face when\u00a0defects occur in their homes.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of building defects and provides for an examination of defective housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing report, &quot;Safe as Houses&quot;.<\/p><p>In this regard, my Department is actively engaging with\u00a0key stakeholders and I have had several meetings with stakeholder representative groups on this matter over recent months.

The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:<\/p>  <p>  -  Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.)<\/p>  <p>  -  established Health and Safety needs <\/p>  <p>  -  state of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.?) and <\/p>  <p>  -  value for money offered by the proposal.<\/p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally.  <\/p>  <p>  A new fire station at Urlingford is provided for in this Capital Programme. Kilkenny County Council has indicated that Urlingford is their number one fire station priority. The Council submitted a capital review and outline cost plan to my Department in 2020 which are currently under review. I understand that the Council is to seek Part VIII planning approval in Q1 2021. My Department will continue to work with Kilkenny County Council to progress the Urlingford fire station project.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300068#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":1007,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300068#WRQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1008,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[1728\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300068#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the part of the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018 that precludes a person who is in the very early stages of a construction project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1009,"content":"<p>Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans (RIHL) are provided in accordance with the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018 and the statutory credit policy issued in accordance with the Regulations.

The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).<\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone.

It also acknowledges that flexibility in terms of modes of assessment of student teachers by HEI tutors is necessary and outlines a range of feasible options that can be considered by HEIs. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the evolving context, my Department and the Teaching Council have had ongoing engagement with stakeholders in respect of the practical implementation of this guidance since its publication in August 2020 and will continue to engage with stakeholders in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300070#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Attendance","counter":1157,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300070#WRS01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1158,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[1635\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300070#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of absence reports over 20 days recorded by the Tusla education support service, TESS, in the 2020-21 academic year to date; and if there has been an increase in the number of absence reports over 20 days to TESS compared to this time in 2020 in the 2019-2020 academic year.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1159,"content":"<p>Tusla Education Support Service has received 1512 referrals up to the end of November 2020 for the academic year 2020\/2021.

In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract, as best as possible, the impact of windows being open (partially when classrooms in use and fully when not in use) in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has reviewed the HPSC guidance that consideration be given to installing an indoor air quality monitor in classrooms.  The purpose of a monitor in this context is to assist in determining when windows should be opened.  It should be noted that an air monitor would not increase the air temperature in a classroom. As reflected in the updated guidance, my Department has concluded that windows are likely to be required to be open at a frequency outlined earlier to ensure appropriate levels of ventilation in the classroom irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted through the indoor air quality monitor (re-active approach) or through the pro-active approach outlined in the guidance. This has been agreed with the partners in education. While this matter (and supporting data) will be kept under review, my Department does not consider it necessary for schools to install such monitors in classrooms, where the practical steps outlined in the update guidance are applied. However, it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for this purpose or alternatively schools may wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for provision of permanent background ventilation, where required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300070#WRS05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300070#WRS05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1197,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[44749\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300070#WRS05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when parents will receive payments under the school transport grant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1198,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.<\/p>  <p>  Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p>  <p>  The advisory group met on 25 November and on 14 December 2020, with a further meeting planned for later this month. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. <\/p>  <p>  From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. <\/p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074\/2020  (Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. <\/p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at www.examinations.ie\/misc-doc\/BI-EX-12232019.pdf. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. <\/p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.

This model is based on what the research shows is effective in the application of psychology and facilitates a number of ways for psychologists to engage with schools. The needs of children and young people are met most effectively where parents, teachers and psychologist work collaboratively, consulting with each other with regard to the issue or concern. Other agencies and other staff in the school may also be involved.\u00a0 This could for example include a special education teacher, SNA or personnel from the NCSE. \u00a0The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS encourages and supports schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations<\/p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p><p>The advisory group met on 25 November and on 14 December 2020, with a further meeting planned for later this month. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. <\/p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. <\/p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. <\/p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie\/backtoschool<\/i>. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074\/2020\u00a0 (Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have \u00a0in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.<\/p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. <\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication\u00a0of coursework and that circular is available at <i>www.examinations.ie\/misc-doc\/BI-EX-12232019.pdf<\/i>. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. <\/p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.\u00a0 The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.<\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.\u00a0 All documentation published is available on <i>www.gov.ie\/backtoschool<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300072#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300072#WRU01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1311,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[45195\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300072#WRU01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the measures she will take to address accommodation inadequacies at a school (details supplied) in County Kerry;

Visiting Teachers continue to be available to provide advice and support to parents, students and teachers during this period of remote teaching and learning. Visiting Teachers will undertake structured engagement with the families of students to whom they currently provide support to. This engagement will involve an initial check in with advice on available supports and resources. In particular, the Visiting Teacher will provide support on the use of assistive technology in the home.

These years have seen considerable research on children&rsquo;s learning and development and much societal change. Through reviews and evaluations, we have learned a lot about the successes of the curriculum as well as the challenges with the latter including curriculum overload. There have also been calls for curriculum change, including increased time for existing areas such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Physical Education (PE). New aspects of learning such as Coding and Computational Thinking, Education about Religions and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics, Modern Foreign Languages, as well as a greater emphasis on Well-being, have been suggested.<\/p>  <p>  Reviewing and redeveloping the primary curriculum <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework in February 2020. The draft framework responds to the context above and sets out a clear vision and principles &mdash; what&rsquo;s important in primary education and why &mdash; and a description, in broad terms, of what should be prioritised in children&rsquo;s learning during their primary school years. <\/p>  <p>  Central to developing these proposals have been the processes of:<\/p>  <p>-  generating and engaging with an extensive body of\u00a0research  \u00a0from national and international sources<\/p>  <p>-  working closely with schools through the\u00a0Schools Forum   <\/p>  <p>-  deliberation  \u00a0with education partners through NCCA representative structures<\/p>  <p>-  previous and ongoing public\u00a0consultations  .<\/p>  <p>  Consultation on the draft framework <\/p>  <p>  In response to the pandemic, the NCCA re-designed the consultation on the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework which now sees it comprising two phases. Phase 1 took place from late February to December 2020 and included bilateral meetings with more than fifty organisations, a number of which were Irish-medium organisations. Phase 2 will commence in September 2021 and will prioritise engagement with teachers, school leaders, parents and, importantly, children, including school communities in the Irish-medium sector. Feedback from across the two phases of consultation will inform the finalisation of the framework which, in turn, will then guide the redevelopment of the curriculum in the years ahead. <\/p>  <p>  Proposals on time allocation <\/p>  <p>  The proposals on time allocation presented in the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework for consultation are intended to support teachers&rsquo; and schools&rsquo; work with the redeveloped curriculum. The proposed time allocations are made up of two categories:<\/p>  <p>  -  Minimum Curriculum Time provides a weekly time allocation for Language; Mathematics; and Well-being, and a monthly time allocation for Science and Technology Education; Social and Environmental Education; and Arts Education. <\/p>  <p>  -  Flexible Time is responsive to schools&rsquo; own present and future educational priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Three options for &lsquo;Minimum Curriculum Time&rsquo; and &lsquo;Flexible Time&rsquo; are presented in the draft framework. The options are intended to support discussion during the consultation on how time might be allocated in a redeveloped primary curriculum. A key consideration in the development of the options was that, with the exception of Well-being (PE and SPHE) and breaks and recreation, time was taken from all areas and aspects of the curriculum in order to arrive at a set of options for consideration and discussion as we think about the type of primary curriculum needed for children over the next fifteen years. Final decisions about time allocations will be made following the consultation. <\/p>  <p>  Primary Language Curriculum\/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile <\/p>  <p>  Time allocations are provided in the 1999 primary curriculum and in the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework as a practical support for teachers as they work with the different subjects in the curriculum. Like all areas of the curriculum, children&rsquo;s learning of Irish is not confined to the specific blocks of time allocated to it. For example, in the case of English-medium schools, the new Primary Language Curriculum (2019) supports the use of Irish throughout the school day by using Irish regularly as an informal means of communication in the classroom or across the school community and by teaching other subjects or aspects of other subjects through Irish using Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). CLIL, an initiative supported by the Department of Education, affords children the opportunity to learn concepts, dispositions and skills in a particular curriculum area through Irish, and to develop their confidence by using their new language skills in real contexts outside of the discrete language lesson. In fact many of the approaches supported by the curriculum support the use of Irish outside of the discrete Irish lesson, including &ndash; Second Language Learning, the Communicative Approach, Transfer of Skill, Immersion, Play, and Cross Curriculum and Disciplinary Literacy.

The Government has always been guided by public health advice in relation to what is safe in schools. NPHET remain of the view that schools are low risk environments but recognise there is a need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus in the community at this time.<\/p><p>It remains my firm intention to operate the conventional 2021 Leaving Certificate examinations, with appropriate public health measures in place. This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations<\/p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p><p>The advisory group met on 25 November and on 14 December 2020, with a further meeting planned for later this month. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. <\/p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. <\/p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. <\/p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie\/backtoschool . <\/i><\/p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. <\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time.

The early provision of the 2020-2021 ICT funding is to enable schools to implement Circular 0074\/2020, issued in November 2020, advising schools of the requirement to provide for the continuity of teaching and learning through utilising relevant digital communications\/learning platforms to support contingency planning in the event of further public health related school closures<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that poor access to home broadband does present challenges for the education system in the current crisis, and that remote learning may not be appropriate or feasible for some students. With this in mind, schools have been asked to consider the needs of all students in planning their approaches to remote learning to ensure that students who may not have adequate broadband services or who may not be able to access online classes.

Using internationally recognised standards set by the International Labour Organisation, these students would not normally be considered, or counted, as unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  While the\u00a0employment of young people is significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that\u00a0youth unemployment levels typically fall quite quickly once economic activity resumes.\u00a0 In addition, the jobs\u00a0of\u00a0many persons currently on PUP\u00a0will not be permanently lost\u00a0due to the\u00a0pandemic.\u00a0Many will return to previous employment once restrictions ease, as they did\u00a0during previous easing of restrictions during 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill\u00a0and to find new jobs.\u00a0\u00a0My Department is\u00a0supporting initiatives\u00a0to\u00a0assist\u00a0 people,\u00a0including\u00a0young people, get back to work,\u00a0once\u00a0COVID restrictions and their\u00a0impact on the economy and labour market begin to ease. Under the July Jobs Stimulus,\u00a0my Department, along with the Department of Further\u00a0and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are putting in place the following measures:<\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo\u00a0Centres during Q1 2021 with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports. Case\u00a0officer support to help people with job search advice and assistance is\u00a0shown to be the most effective means of helping people move into employment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the current contracts\u00a0of existing contracted public employment service providers into 2021.\u00a0In particular, the Local Employment\u00a0Service is being extended into four new areas and the capacity of the\u00a0service increased by 50%.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the benefit of the\u00a0JobsPlus recruitment\u00a0subsidy\u00a0to employers who hire young people.\u00a0\u00a0Under\u00a0this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once\u00a0they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed\u00a0for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of\u00a0a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months). \u00a0This will help make it more attractive to\u00a0recruit young people who face difficulties in securing a footing in employment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Providing access to additional full-time and\u00a0part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000\u00a0new education and training places for those currently unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for\u00a0each new apprentice recruited until June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education\u00a0Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the\u00a0pandemic by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months. My Department will actively promote this scheme to suitable candidates and although it is not budget capped, additional provision has been made in Budget 2021 of &euro;3.5million &ndash; equivalent to an extra 700 places.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, building on the success of the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS), my Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new work placement experience programme for those out of work for at least six months. This programme will seek to encourage\u00a0businesses\u00a0 provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market\u00a0and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;.\u00a0 There is a target of over 10,000 persons, regardless of age, to be placed on this six-month scheme by end of this year. I expect to launch the Programme\u00a0\u00a0as soon\u00a0as public health restrictions allow in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Work is also at an advanced stage by my Department to develop Pathways to Work, the national employment services strategy for the period 2021-2025. The strategy will seek to build upon those support measures outlined above as we assist young people on their journey to work.\u00a0 Publication is expected in early 2021, following the launch of the Government's National Economic Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In developing these programmes and services the Department is working closely with, and being advised by, the Labour Market Advisory Council which is composed of leading market experts, representatives of industry and workers and representatives of unemployed people.\u00a0 We will keep these programmes under review and report progress on a regular basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300075#WRX05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath

supervisors who are employed by CE schemes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>CE sponsoring authorities are the legal employers of their CE supervisors, CE assistant supervisors and CE participants. There are no plans to change this status of CE supervisors. The Department&rsquo;s role continues to be that of CE funder. <\/p><p>This\u00a0issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.\u00a0 A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal.\u00a0<\/p><p>As part of this process a\u00a0detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.\u00a0 This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum\u00a0depending on the numbers involved.\u00a0 This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.\u00a0<\/p><p>In its findings, the\u00a0High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector,\u00a0any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors\u00a0could\u00a0potentially\u00a0give rise to claims for funding for employees in the broader sector.\u00a0 The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform\u00a0stated that it\u00a0had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent when dealing with the specific issue as regards CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.. <\/p><p>At this point, I wish to\u00a0acknowledge the valuable and\u00a0dedicated service\u00a0that CE\u00a0supervisors provide in running CE\u00a0schemes\u00a0delivering\u00a0local based\u00a0community services while\u00a0providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.<\/p><p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing the CE Supervisors\u00a0continue to engage\u00a0in\u00a0discussions and I am hopeful that, with goodwill and flexibility on all sides,\u00a0a resolution can be found in the near future.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that funding of any potential pension provision\u00a0for CE\u00a0supervisors will ultimately be\u00a0a matter for\u00a0the\u00a0Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the\u00a0wider economic and budgetary context in which any such\u00a0scheme will need to\u00a0operate.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>Nevertheless I, and my colleague the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform are keen to find an approach that will resolve this issue in the near future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300075#WRX07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance","counter":1573,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300075#WRX07300"},{"type":"question","counter":1574,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[44826\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300075#WRX07400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision on a disability allowance claim will be made for a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1575,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been awarded disability allowance (DA)\u00a0with effect from 26 August\u00a02020.

Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on this particular case. <\/p>  <p>  However, in general terms, the following are important points to note.<\/p>  <p>  The Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) pension is paid to the husband, wife or surviving civil partner of a deceased person and is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or on that of the deceased spouse or civil partner, provided the applicant is not cohabiting.  <\/p>  <p>  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage or civil partnership is regulated by the Minister for Justice.  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties that do not exist in law between cohabiting couples.  Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore, lose someone who had legal duties towards them, and the social welfare code recognises this by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions. <\/p>  <p>  It was for these reasons that the social welfare supports for widows and widowers were extended to surviving civil partners from 1 January 2011, when the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 came into force.<\/p>  <p>  Awarding widows pensions, or a similar benefit, to people who are not legally widows, widowers or surviving civil partners would involve a significant income support policy change and could also be very costly.  The basis on which a person would become entitled to such a pension, would require significant consideration and raise complex challenges.  Accordingly, any changes to eligibility criteria for widow's pension would need to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300077#WRZ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300077#WRZ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1684,"qnumday":597,"qnumall":"[1799\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300077#WRZ03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the details for her Department for outsourcing to consultancies of specifically Covid-19-related work, services or advice; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1685,"content":"<p>The Department has not used outsourcing to consultancies for specifically Covid-related work, services or advice.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300077#WRZ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":1686,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300077#WRZ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1687,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[1875\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300077#WRZ03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when pandemic unemployment payment arrears will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1688,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment received by the person concerned on the 20th October 2020 was in respect of the period 9th October 2020 to the 15th October 2020. <\/p><p>I am advised that when PUP arrears were being calculated in respect of the person concerned, a payment in respect of the period from 2nd to the 8th October was processed but these arrears were nullified by an earlier PUP overpayment for the period from 24th to 30th July 2020.<\/p><p>In practical terms, while the person concerned was awarded PUP with effect from 2 October, the arrears due went towards the overpayment from earlier in the year. <\/p><p>I am advised that the person concerned is consequently not due any payment from the Department at this stage.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300077#WRZ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1690,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[1877\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300077#WRZ03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the pandemic unemployment payment will be extended to those who cannot secure childcare and therefore cannot work during the current restrictions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1691,"content":"<p>To date over &euro;5 billion has been paid in relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment since its introduction in March 2020 in response to the effects of the Covid-19 virus.

Addressing barriers to this forms part of Government policy on gender equality and requires a range of policy solutions.<\/p>  <p>  We know that the burden of childcare in working families falls predominantly on women, and can be a barrier to their full participation in the workforce. The Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 introduced 2 weeks' paid, non-transferrable leave to both parents in the first year of their child's life to ensure that fathers as well as mothers are supported in spending time with their child in his or her earliest years. I will introduce a Bill early in 2021 which will extend Parent's Leave and Benefit to five weeks for each parent, and the period in which it can be taken to two years.<\/p>  <p>  I will also bring forward Government amendments to progress the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019. This Bill, when passed, will oblige companies over a certain size to publish information on their gender pay gap. It is hoped that transparency around this important subject will build awareness within companies and the wider public of the gender pay gap and to take steps to address the gender pay parity. <\/p>  <p>  The National Strategy for Women and Girls includes a series of actions to promote equality for women, including mothers, in the workplace.

This scheme was in addition to the Revenue led Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) \u00a0made available to other sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The TWSCS supported approximately 3,855 or 85% of early learning and childcare services and ensured that over 22,000 staff in the sector retained their employment relationship with their employer. The 12-week scheme is estimated to cost approximately &euro;50m.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0While the unique 12 week scheme was being developed, preliminary payments were paid in advance to providers to assist their cash flow, enable them to retain their staff and cover some of their overhead costs. These preliminary\/estimated payments resulted in some surplus funding being provided.<\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0was noted from the\u00a0outset of the scheme, a reconciliation would\u00a0take place between the final calculated amount actually due to providers and the preliminary payments that were made.<\/p>  <p>  These reconciliations arise from &ldquo;preliminary&rdquo; payments which were made in April, May and June 2020\u00a0to ensure that providers received funding in a timely manner to enable them pay their staff and avoid laying them off, and cover some of their overhead costs. They were based on estimates of each individual service&rsquo;s staff and overhead requirements, in advance of the more detailed TWSCS subsidy calculations. <\/p>  <p>  The alternative for Pobal and DCYA would have been to await the detailed application form and verification, but this would have delayed payments and could have been detrimental to providers with serious income and cash flow difficulties caused by the COVID-19 closure.<\/p>  <p>  Providers are able to view details of the TWSCS overpayments\u00a0on the providers platform on Pobal's IT system PIP.  The TWSCS contract value is provided, along with the amount paid, resulting in a balance due. However, should providers have concerns in relation to the overpayment amounts shown, or require further detail, they should contact the provider centre in the first instance to highlight and address their concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Many services had the excess amount in their accounts and were in a position to repay it. In fact several providers expressed a wish to return the excess funding immediately and have done so in advance of\u00a0 the recoupment process which commenced in November 2020. Refunds of overpayments continue to be made to Pobal by providers in January 2021. <\/p>  <p>  For providers who did not have funds on hand\u00a0at the time and therefore\u00a0were unable to refund the excess funding immediately, an alternative arrangement was put in place. The deduction of the overpayment was spread over the remaining Programme payments from the 20 November to the end of 2020. However, my department acknowledged that, despite the wide ranging Covid-19 supports available to date, there may be some providers who may continue to experience ongoing viability concerns and this alternative arrangement may not them suit at that time. In such cases, my Department put a third option in place. My Department asked and indeed encouraged any provider who had concerns to register a service request on Hive. The provider would be contacted by Pobal and an opportunity for an alternative plan would be\u00a0discussed. <\/p>  <p>  Providers were given an\u00a0opportunity make final amendments to their subsidy application form in November 2020. Any changes made to the application form in the amendment window would result in a recalculation of the 12 week subsidy. Any recalculation of the TWSCS subsidy\u00a0may result in the overpayment amount being adjusted. <\/p>  <p>  The final 12 week subsidy recalculation was run in early December. Pobal are now in the\u00a0process of\u00a0completing\u00a0recalculation process\u00a0and adjusting\u00a0overpayments amounts to be repaid if necessary, for the providers who made adjustments to their application form. It is anticipated the\u00a0recalculation process\u00a0will\u00a0\u00a0be finalised in the coming weeks as Pobal continue to make the final Revenue and quality assurance checks as required. <\/p>  <p>  As stated previously, Pobal recognises the immense pressure that services have been under and is committed to continuing to work with the Department and the sector to support it through these exceptionally difficult times.<\/p>  <p>  The measures put in place to support the ELC and SAC sector since March 12 have been very successful including the TWSCS and the EWSS. Approximately the same number of services have reopened in late 2020 as were open in late 2019, despite reports that up to 1,000 would close. This is a phenomenal result and reflects both the effectiveness of the Government measures and the hard work of the sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300078#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1735,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300078#WRAA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1736,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[44738\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300078#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the way in which a person (details supplied) who is a survivor of a mother and baby home can access counselling to deal with the aftermath of events that occurred; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1737,"content":"<p>I recognise the\u00a0importance of ensuring former residents&rsquo; mental health is prioritised and supported.

In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students the Government approved once off funding of &euro;50m to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year.

In addition to the once off &euro;250 funding for full time postgraduate students, the main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression. Postgraduate students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his\/her fees. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the strategic direction set out for the Review of SUSI, Budget 2021 announced the following enhanced supports for postgraduate grants - increase the fee grant to &euro;3,500 from &euro;2,000 from September 2021. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and would give greater certainty for students in terms of supports.<\/p>  <p>  There are initiatives across a number of Government Departments to facilitate broadband connection through community-based broadband hubs and liaison with telecommunication providers on packages, including unlimited data.

Reflecting the scale and diversity of third-level provision, further and higher education institutions are best equipped to determine where onsite presence is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300080#WRCC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1879,"content":"<p>Question No. 667 answered with Question No. 640.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Erasmus+ Programme","counter":1880,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300080#WRCC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1881,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[1362\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300080#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of the scheme to allow for the continued participation in Erasmus+ mobilities for eligible students of higher education institutions in Northern Ireland; when he expects the scheme to be open for application; the way in which eligibility will be determined; the higher education institutions in Northern Ireland that will be recognised for the purposes of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1882,"content":"<p>In the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, representatives of civic society from all communities in Northern Ireland expressed concern over the loss of access to the EU's Erasmus Mobility Programme\u00a0for students in higher education.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In responding to these concerns, the Irish Government has committed to providing continued access to Erasmus + higher education mobilities for students in NI institutions,\u00a0now that\u00a0the future partnership between the EU and the UK does not provide for this.\u00a0 In implementing this commitment,\u00a0 Ireland\u00a0will seek to\u00a0ensure compliance with Erasmus + programme regulations.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, eligible NI students will be able to register with Irish higher education institutions that hold the Erasmus Mobility Charter for the duration of their planned mobility.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been engaging with the HEA, with representatives from our higher education institutions and with NI institutions to develop operational procedures for the scheme, with further meetings planned between NI and Irish higher education representatives in near future.<\/p>  <p>  As I understand that current Erasmus mobilities in NI are funded by the British Council until the end of the current academic year, this scheme is planned to come into operation at the start of the next academic year in September 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300080#WRCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1883,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300080#WRCC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1884,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[1363\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300080#WRCC01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the policy in place in terms of third level  students who are required to complete a work placement as a part of their studies but are unable to do so due to Covid-19 public health guidelines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1885,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[1364\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300080#WRCC01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if students who are required to complete a work placement to obtain their qualifications but who cannot due to Covid-19 public health advice will have to repeat this work placement next year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1886,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 669 and 670 together.<\/p>  <p>I appreciate that this is a time of considerable stress and concern for third level students and the challenging and stressful circumstances that students are facing are being taken into account by Higher Education institutions as they adapt and respond to the changing situation.

The regime in the D&oacute;chas Centre is very much focused on training and rehabilitation. <\/p>  <p>  However, the requirement to ensure the safety and security of all those who live and work in our prisons is universal and in that regard there were changes made in 2019 to enhance the structure of the prison day in the D&oacute;chas.  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that this has enhanced the regime in the prison and allowed for greater access to vital rehabilitative services. As a result, the women accommodated in the D&oacute;chas now have better access to important services such as mental health services, Psychology Service and Addiction Counsellors. <\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service is acutely aware of the fact that women prisoners are a vulnerable group within the prison system and is aware that the supports for female offenders and their rehabilitative needs are very different to male offenders.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that staff working with female offenders are provided with bespoke training and in February 2020 the Prison Service introduced a new tailored programme for staff to address the special needs of women prisoners called &lsquo;Working with Women in Custody&rsquo;. <\/p>  <p>  To enhance the rehabilitative opportunities for female offenders a new programme in partnership with the Probation Service, called the Outlook Programme which is a step down unit for women offenders, was opened in May 2019.  The project is managed by Focus Ireland and the vision of the programme is to promote the rehabilitation and re-integration of women leaving prison and those who have accommodation needs requiring support in the community. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it may interest the Deputy to know that the construction of a new prison facility to provide accommodation for 50 female prisoners in Limerick Prison is scheduled to become operational in Q4 2021.

Any request of this nature is dealt with promptly.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the current target is that it should take around 12 months for a standard application for a certificate of naturalisation to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made.

The Agreement includes cooperation on law enforcement and criminal justice. In particular, the EU and the UK have agreed to establish a new framework for law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. This will allow for strong cooperation between national police and judicial authorities, including with respect to mutual legal assistance and extradition. <\/p>  <p>  Following the implementation of the new TCA, the Minister for Justice put into effect a planned range of measures prepared to ensure the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom in the Justice and Home Affairs field will remain strong and that co-operation is maintained in the public interest.<\/p>  <p>  Central to this are elements of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020, which was commenced on 17 December 2020. Parts 16 to 20 of the Act contain provisions to deal with the implications of Brexit in a number of key areas in the justice sector. <\/p>  <p>  While the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant no longer apply to the United Kingdom, under the EU-UK TCA, the swift surrender of criminals between the EU and the UK under a new arrest warrant system, avoiding lengthy extradition procedures, thanks to streamlined procedures, strict deadlines, robust safeguards, procedural rights and judicial control, will be enabled. <\/p>  <p>  The Agreement also includes a bridging mechanism, subject to certain conditions, pending the adoption of data protection adequacy decisions, such that for a specified period transmission of personal data from the EU to the UK is not regarded as a transfer to a third country. This bridging solution will mean in practice the continuing exchange from 1 January 2021 of vital law enforcement data between Ireland and the UK. <\/p>  <p>  The above measures are of particular value in supporting the existing excellent operational cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in respect of the full range of policing activities. <\/p>  <p>  There are, of course, other international mechanisms that will also continue to be used to support international cooperation, such as INTERPOL in relation to organised crime matters and mutual assistance provisions.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a range of mechanisms in place to facilitate policing on the island of Ireland. A joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy is operated between the two services.

The licensing of property services providers ensures that licensees comply with certain standards aimed at ensuring protection for their clients. For example, licensees must possess specified minimum qualifications, have available to them professional indemnity insurance and pay an annual contribution to the Compensation Fund. <\/p>  <p>  The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers, and to launch investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations. Where a finding of improper conduct is made by the PSRA, it can impose a range of sanctions: namely, issue a reprimand, warning, caution or advice, suspend or revoke a licence, or direct the licensee to pay a financial penalty (i.e. pay up to &euro;50,000 into the Property Services Compensation Fund, up to &euro;50,000 to the PSRA towards the cost of the investigation, up to &euro;250,000 to the PSRA by way of financial penalty or any combination of the foregoing).<\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for the establishment of the Property Services Compensation Fund which is funded by annual contributions from licensees, and maintained and administered by the PSRA. A person who has suffered financial loss as a result of dishonesty on the part of a licensee, or any principal officer, employee or agent or former principal officer, employee or agent of a licensee arising from the provision of property services on behalf of the licensee, is entitled to apply to the PSRA for a grant from the Fund to compensate him\/her for the loss sustained as a result of the dishonesty.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses that are licensed to provide property services (property services employers and independent contractors) are also required under the Act to have in place professional indemnity insurance. This insurance must cover both the business, and all principal officers and employees engaged in the provision of property services on the business&rsquo;s behalf. The minimum requirements in respect of professional indemnity insurance are set out in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 (Professional Indemnity Insurance) Regulations 2012 (S.I.

The Action Research Project works directly with front-line Youth Justice Workers from local projects to develop interventions and best practice. Based on initial outcomes from the Action Research Project, and evaluations of a number of pilot projects, it is intended to develop proposals to expand the existing services. This would ensure national coverage and a stronger focus on difficult issues such as the hard-to-reach cohort. <\/p><p>These issues are addressed in the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026, which I intend to finalise and bring to Government shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300082#WREE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":2058,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300082#WREE05900"},{"type":"question","counter":2059,"qnumday":733,"qnumall":"[1763\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300082#WREE06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are plans to increase opening times and personnel in Garda stations located in Ardee, Collon and Dunleer, County Louth; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2060,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters, deployment of resources and opening times of Garda stations.

People with complex medical\/ clinical related needs are to remain at home and, where possible to receive the same number of hours support in the home as they had been in receipt of pre-Christmas in day service locations. Providers have been asked to reduce contacts via hubs\/bubbles, with dedicated staff for dedicated service users, where possible. Where families are uncomfortable with allowing their family member to return to a day service location, a package of support within available resources will be agreed with the service user and family.<\/p><p>The full guidance is available on the HSE website at: <\/p><p> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Data","counter":2128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06100"},{"type":"question","counter":2129,"qnumday":756,"qnumall":"[44661\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of disability services by county; the current capacity of each; and the plan to address the backlog of therapy sessions.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2130,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, recognises the need to improve services for both children and adults with disabilities through better implementation and by working together across Government in a better way.<\/p><p>The  Government commits to prioritising early diagnosis and access to services for children and ensuring that the most effective interventions are provided for each child, to guarantee the best outcomes.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Equipment","counter":2131,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06400"},{"type":"question","counter":2132,"qnumday":757,"qnumall":"[44670\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of the deep brain stimulation service for Parkinson's disease in the Mater Hospital, Dublin.","asker":"1476","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2133,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":2134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06700"},{"type":"question","counter":2135,"qnumday":758,"qnumall":"[44681\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300083#WRFF06800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) who was recently interviewed for a grade 4 position within the HSE community healthcare organisation or CHO 3, can have previous interviews taken into account for the position based on extenuating circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2136,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE as the employing agency in this case to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.

It is also not clear whether the thresholds for protective immunity are the same in all groups e.g. older persons or those who are immunosuppressed. Thus, it is premature to discuss immunity passports due to the many uncertainties that still exist regarding immunity against the novel corona virus.

However, due to the recent rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the community and the need to reduce the number of people coming into the children&rsquo;s hospitals, CHI will be prioritising emergency, urgent and time sensitive procedures and care. In so far as possible, most out-patient clinics will be moved to virtual or telephone clinics, unless specified by the consultant that a face to face review is needed.  <\/p>  <p>  CHI has further advised my Department that there is an active recruitment campaign for an additional Rheumatology Consultant underway. This additional position will allow for an increased number of patients to be seen, diagnosed and treatment initiated, as part of the comprehensive Rheumatology service.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of MRI services, the demand for specialist imaging has increased over recent years due to increased activity and acuity in CHI, as well as an increasing trend to utilise imaging in diagnosis and treatment.

There has been a consistent level of capital investment in core ICT infrastructure and clinical systems since the publication of the eHealth strategy in 2013. An enterprise wide EHR systems was deployed in the largest acute hospitals in Ireland (St James Hospital, Dublin) in 2018. The procurement of an even more extensive EHR for the national children&rsquo;s hospital is currently underway. Standards are being developed to support interoperability between health systems. The provision of more care in the community and reducing our reliance on services delivered in the acute hospital sector, will require the delivery of healthcare records for patients that can be accessed across the health sector, allowing 'data to follow the patient'. This is one of the ambitions of the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme and will lead to greater levels of integrated care and the ability to treat more patients nearer to home.<\/p>  <p>  There are relatively few countries that have achieved a level of integrated health care records at national level.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.<\/p>  <p>  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300087#WRMM06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300087#WRMM07000"},{"type":"question","counter":2446,"qnumday":856,"qnumall":"[45053\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300087#WRMM07100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that hundreds of ear, nose and throat, ENT, patients at Beaumont Hospital have had their appointments moved to a variety of different hospitals at short notice; and if the reason is, as alleged, that Beaumont does not have the capacity, facilities and staffing levels to carry out these scheduled appointments.","asker":"1467","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2447,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300087#WRMM07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300087#WRMM07300"},{"type":"question","counter":2449,"qnumday":857,"qnumall":"[45055\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300087#WRMM07400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review correspondence regarding a child (details supplied); if the appointment will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2450,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last year as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently recommending that only critical time dependent elective procedures are undertaken at this time due to the on-going and significant increased demand for bed capacity related to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.<\/p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

This was utilised specifically in respect of the development of the first four Regional Fertility Hubs &ndash; namely, at Cork Maternity University Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital. <\/p>  <p>  While three of the first four regional hubs are based in Dublin, their total catchment area relates to that of the four corresponding regional health areas of the country. <\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of just over &euro;1m is being made available to enable the continuation and completion of Phase One of the roll-out in 2021, including through the setting-up of the final two Regional Fertility Hubs, to be located in Galway and Limerick.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The roll-out of Phase One has been slowed due to the management of the Covid-19 pandemic by the health service broadly and its impact upon the provision of elective health services, including fertility services.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country and the AHR legislation commenced. While it is not possible at this juncture to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the roll-out, the introduction of a publicly-funded model of care for fertility treatment is a Programme for Government commitment. It is intended that, in line with available resources, this will be fully implemented on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.

Scoliosis activity accounts for 20% of overall orthopaedic activity across CHI.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTE in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis services. The posts relate to the multidisciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively. The majority of posts were allocated to each hospital in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  On 2 January 2021, the HSE issued correspondence to the Acute hospital system advising of the need to curtail scheduled elective care. This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and the projected trend in admissions based upon community transmission levels of Covid-19. CHI has advised that under the current HSE guidelines, they have reduced the number of procedures to urgent and those that are time sensitive rather than a blanket cessation of all activity as was done in March\/April last year.<\/p>  <p>  CHI have confirmed that urgent Outpatient appointments continue to be held face to face, while some routine appointments have been deferred. Many specialties have switched to virtual appointments with some blended face to face appointments where deemed appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE have confirmed that this position will be reviewed weekly throughout January. <\/p>  <p>  Key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as the current two-metre distancing, have had a material impact on the available physical space to deliver services, including scoliosis procedures. However, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland have confirmed that time dependent and urgent procedures will continue to be undertaken in CHI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300093#WRSS04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":2828,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300093#WRSS04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2829,"qnumday":1001,"qnumall":"[1338\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300093#WRSS04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when child specific wait lists, a recommendation of the 2017 report Waiting for Scoliosis Treatment: A Children' Rights Issue, will be in place across the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2830,"content":"<p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF)\u00a0is a corporate body with functions and responsibilities as set out under Statutory Instrument 179 - National Treatment Purchase Fund (Establishment) Order, 2004.

This Article sets out: provided that TACs have been agreed, each Party shall grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas that year.  Access shall be granted at a level and on conditions determined in those annual consultations.  In relation to the main access arrangements, the Agreement also provides that the outcome of the consultations should normally result in each Party granting:   <\/p>  <p>  (a) access to fish stocks listed in the Annex to the Agreement - these are the stocks that are shared between the EU and UK subject to at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the parties respective shares of the TACs;<\/p>  <p>  (b) access to fish non- quota stocks in each other's EEZ at a level that at least equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016; and<\/p>  <p>  (c) access to waters of the Parties between 6 and 12nm in ICES divisions 4c (southern North Sea and 7d-g (English Channel, south - west coast of England and part of south - east coast of Ireland) to the extent that Union fishing vessels and UK fishing vessels had access to these waters on 31 December 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to work to ensure that fishing vessels which traditionally fished in UK waters will be granted such access by the UK authorities. <\/p>  <p>  While authorisation for access for all licensed and registered fishing vessels has been sought from the UK authorities, at this time approval has been granted to tranches of fishing vessels which have been identified as requiring such access.     <\/p>  <p>  The UK Authorities authorised access on a staged basis initially on 31 December for 141 vessels which were identified, in consultation with the Producer Organisations, taking into account vessels that were most likely to fish in the first week of January.  The vessels were identified in the days before the end of the year taking into account the Department's understanding of the fisheries and in consultation with the four Producer Organisations (Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation,  Irish Fish Producers Organisation, Irish South &amp;amp; East Fish Producers Organisation and the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation).  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to vessels targeting mackerel in the RSW Pelagic segment and in the Polyvalent segment, these were specifically identified because mackerel is fished only in UK waters at the start of the year.  In addition for the first tranche of 141 vessels, I understand that the POs identified vessels in their organisations which they were aware of as likely to fish in the start of the year in UK waters.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the 31st December 2020, two further lists of Irish vessels have been sent to the Commission to request authorisation, by the UK authorities, for these vessels to fish in the 12- 200 nm UK EEZ based on licence holders who contacted the Department seeking such access and those that had fished in UK waters in 2019 or 2020 based on relevant records. A further 48 vessels have now been authorised by the UK authorities and the Department has been advised by the Commission that the second list of 20  vessels has already been transmitted to the UK authorities and is hoping to hear shortly regarding the status of this request.  The Department is considering how smaller fishing vessels that do not have a Vessel Monitoring System to record activity maybe appropriately identified and will be consulting the National Inshore Fisheries Forum in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300099#WRYY05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":3220,"qnumday":1151,"qnumall":"[1475\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300099#WRYY05400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason the mackerel quota cannot be divided fairly to all Irish fishing boats; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3221,"content":"<p>The applicants of the Judicial Review (2017\/816JR) are challenging a decision made by the Minister in July 2017 in respect of the allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s total mackerel fishing quota (Ministerial Decision regarding a Proposal from the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&amp;amp;WFPO) for a revised mackerel distribution between the Polyvalent Segment and the RSW Pelagic Segment). <\/p><p>As this matter is sub judice, I am not in a position to comment until the matter is dealt with in the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300099#WRYY05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3222,"content":"<p>Question No. 1152 answered with Question No. 1150.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":3223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300099#WRYY05700"},{"type":"question","counter":3224,"qnumday":1153,"qnumall":"[1523\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300099#WRYY05800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the contingency measures he has put in place in the event that the UK enters into post-Brexit trade agreements with non-EU partners that will allow food product that may supplant Irish produce to enter the UK market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3225,"content":"<p>The key challenge here is to maximise the volume and value of Irish agri-food exports to all destinations, and to anticipate and, as best we can, mitigate the potential impact of adverse developments in trading patterns.

The CFP provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas.<\/p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP.  The EU Commission has advised that it intends to commence the Common Fisheries Policy review process following clarity on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.  At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.   <\/p>  <p>  The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first CFP in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record).  The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, on the basis of a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU. The Hague Preferences give Ireland an increased share of traditional stocks (cod, whiting, haddock, sole and plaice) when Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels reduce below a specified level.<\/p>  <p>  Any change to the existing system of quota allocations would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This would require other Member States to give up existing quota shares. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other  Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.<\/p>  <p>  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the upcoming review of the CFP, including the interaction with stakeholders, to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.  I have previously stated that I am committed to doing all possible through the review of the CFP to secure additional quota where possible for Irish fishers.  The Programme for Government sets down an ambitious programme of actions that promote a sustainable seafood industry and we are committed to working to continue to build on the progress that has been made to secure a sustainable future for our fishing industry and the coastal communities which depend upon it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300100#WRZZ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":3282,"qnumday":1175,"qnumall":"[1565\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011300100#WRZZ04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if, in view of the changes brought about by Brexit, he plans designating extra ports for landing fish from boats registered outside the EU to facilitate boats owned by Irish fishermen, North and South, but registered in Northern Ireland land at ports other than Killybegs and Castletownbere, which are the only ports designated for this purpose at this point in time; if he has considered the risk of not having extra ports designated in the context of smaller boats having to steam numerous hours at sea to land at a designated port; the analysis that has been done on the possible carbon footprint saving on designating extra ports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3283,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, from 1 January 2021, the United Kingdom has become a Third Country and therefore subject to Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) legislation and North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) requirements.
