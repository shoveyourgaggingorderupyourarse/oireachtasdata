As such, the Early Years Forum which I chair, includes membership from two Irish language organisations.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department does not currently provide dedicated funding to any specific Irish language groups, it does support Irish in many other ways and has committed to a number of significant actions within the Action Plan for the Irish Language 2018-2022. These actions aim to build and improve on existing measures, supports and partnerships that are provided through, for example, Better Start, the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate and local City and Country Childcare Committees. <\/p>  <p>  Key among these actions will be the appointment of two dedicated posts to co-ordinate Irish language supports in early years. My Department is currently working on specifying these posts with colleagues in the Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with a view to recruitment in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In all, my Department funds some 228 services which identify themselves as Na&iacute;onra&iacute;, both within and outside the Gaeltacht areas.  Total funding of some &euro;16m was provided to such services over the past four years and the many supports which are available from my Department are offered to all early years services and na&iacute;onra&iacute;, both inside and outside the Gaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, I will shortly be commissioning an independent review of structures that support the Early Years Sector. While I cannot pre-empt any of the findings of any such review, I would expect that a key component will be a process of engagement with all of the early years stakeholder groups, including Irish language organisations such as that referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300058#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Funding","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300058#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[52441\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300058#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the way in which the &euro;1.2 million funding to provide first aid training for each registered childcare service has been dispersed by county; the number of childcare providers that have availed of the service; and the average amount dispersed to each facility.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>The allocation of &euro;1.2million was made in Budget 2019 and I am pleased to confirm that preparations are well under way for roll-out of training to every registered early learning and care service to meet the new First Aid Response (FAR) standard.

I do not have a role in the family reunification process. Family reunification falls under the policy remit of my Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  A separated child seeking asylum may make an application for  reunification with  family members, depending on the circumstances of their arrival and their status in Ireland. Where the family are already in Ireland, the UK or EU, Tusla will work with the separated child seeking asylum, where it is deemed in their interest, to reunify that child with their family as soon as possible.   Children arriving through the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, and who have their status approved prior to, or within a short period of arrival, are in a position to apply for their family to come to Ireland.  Decisions about such applications are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  A child seeking asylum who arrives at a point of entry unaccompanied by parents or guardians is taken into the care of Tusla and it is required that their leave to remain status is established  before they can apply for family to join them in Ireland. The possibility of family reunification is considered as part of a detailed needs assessment process carried out when a child comes into the care of Tusla.   Not all young persons are in a position to make an informed application for international protection on arrival; some are deeply traumatised from their experiences. They need a period of stability and care before being supported in making their application for residency. Some young people may need medical or psychological supports on arrival, and some may need educational supports and intensive social work support in order to prepare them for making the application.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the process of applying for asylum, and applying for family reunification where eligible, can be difficult, and in some cases stressful. Every separated child seeking asylum has an allocated social worker, who works with the child to prepare them for the application process, and to secure supports for the child in line with their needs and best interests.<\/p>  <p>  All factors, including potential for family reunification, and reunification with a guardian, are considered by the social worker when evaluating the right time to make an application with a young person.

The scheme will open to applications in October 2019, with payments flowing from November 2019.  Its launch will mark a milestone in our quest to transform Ireland's childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world into one of the best.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to report that good progress continues to be made in the development of the legislative, administrative and ICT infrastructure for the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  As you know, earlier this year, with wide cross party support, the Childcare Support Act 2018 was signed into law.  Detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines are now being prepared under the auspices of the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  I also hope to sign regulations in the coming weeks which will provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services.  This will allow these services to participate in the new scheme from the start.  It also represents an important first step on the path to full regulation for school-age childcare services.  <\/p>  <p>  Our IT development contractor, Codec, is busy working with officials from DCYA and Pobal to develop the scheme's supporting IT system on schedule and in advance of the scheme's October launch.<\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive awareness campaign for parents and the public will commence in the spring, alongside training and information supports for childcare providers and other key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  I was delighted in Budget 2019 to have been able to enhance the originally proposed Affordable Childcare Scheme by raising the upper and lower income thresholds. More families will benefit as a result of these revised thresholds. The increase to the lower threshold to &euro;26,000 now poverty proofs the scheme and the increase to the upper threshold to &euro;60,000 net income also ensures that families earning up to &euro;100,000 gross income may benefit from targeted subsidies. <\/p>  <p>  Registration with Tusla will be a requirement for any childminder wishing to take part in the Affordable Childcare Scheme and, therefore, the widening of registration to more childminders will be necessary if parents who use childminders are to benefit from childcare subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to publishing a Childminding Action Plan in the near future.  The Plan will contain short, medium and long term goals for the sector, setting out steps to move towards the wider regulation, support and professional development of childminders.  In the short term, it will include actions to support already eligible childminders to register and participate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 allocated &euro;0.5m to create a team of Childminding Development Officers to support the registration of childminders with Tusla and to help them upskill to the required regulatory standards to be introduced in the coming years.  <\/p>  <p>  Recent developments for childminders include the opening of a bursary fund under the DCYA Learner Fund to support childminders to obtain a relevant NFQ Level 5 qualification, which is currently required for childminders to register with Tusla. It is anticipated that this financial support will incentivise more childminders eligible to register with Tusla to do so in advance of the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  DCYA also currently provide childminding development grants of up to &euro;1,000 for childminders who provide a home based childminding service.  This grant can be applied for every 2 years to make modifications to the service or to purchase toys, educational material or equipment.  To be eligible for the grant, a childminder must have completed the Quality Awareness Programme or Children First: Child Protection and Welfare training, and be voluntarily notified to their local City\/County Childcare Committee or registered with Tusla.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300059#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parental Leave","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300059#WRB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[52431\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300059#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps she is taking to support stay-at-home parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to supporting parents in caring for young children at home in a range of ways.<\/p>  <p>  Within the remit of my Department, a number of schemes provide support to parents whether they work full time, part time, or look after their children at home.<\/p>  <p>  For example, from September of this year, all children are eligible to avail of two years of universal pre-school, without cost, through the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) prior to beginning primary school. Some 114,000 children are expected to benefit, many of whom will be children of stay-at-home parents.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the current targeted early learning and care subsidy schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, medical cards, or GP Visit cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents.<\/p>  <p>  A universal subsidy is available to all parents of children under the age of three, or whenever the child becomes eligible for the universal preschool programme, regardless of whether parents are working outside the home or not. The Affordable Childcare Scheme, ACS, which is under development will make early learning and care subsidies available on the basis of family income and will be available to stay-at-home parents. This is underpinned by the Childcare Support Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for local parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and young children in the community to support their development through play. Both working parents and stay-at-home parents participate.  <\/p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per child per month is available for all children. Budget 2019 announced an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,500 per year.<\/p>  <p>  There has also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.  Budget 2019 also announced the introduction of a new parental leave scheme which will be available to both fathers and mothers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently led the development and publication of First 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families.

The allowance is not considered as means for Social Welfare purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care.

In that regard, my Department has participated proactively with colleagues in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Education and Skills in agreeing a comprehensive set of actions to be implemented under the Action Plan for the Irish Language 2018 to 2022, launched by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in June 2018.  This five year action plan sets out a range of agreed actions, with associated timeframes, to be implemented in support of the overarching 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has committed to a range of actions designed to affirm the importance of the role that early years settings can play in fostering Irish language proficiency.  The aim of these actions is to build on existing measures, supports and partnerships in the area of Irish-medium early years education and further improve supports and services.  The agreed actions include the creation of two Irish language early years posts to co-ordinate the development of Irish language provision in the early years sector in non Gaeltacht areas, and the establishment of a baseline of supports for na&iacute;onra&iacute; that will inform future policy plans.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts are also being made within my Department to ensure improved communication with Irish speaking childcare services, in particular in the context of the major national childcare schemes that my Department funds.  For example, in relation to the forthcoming Affordable Childcare Scheme, the website currently in development will be available in Irish, as will the parent application portal.  Communications in relation to the launch of the new Scheme will also be available in Irish.  The contact support centre will have Irish speakers on staff.  Training for the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) that helps children with a disability to participate in the ECCE scheme has been made available through Irish for Gaeltacht pre-school settings, and the AIM website and materials are available in the Irish language.  These are just some examples of the ways in which my Department is engaging with, and ensuring that, Irish medium childcare services are facilitated to provide their services through the Irish language.<\/p>  <p>  A Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families was launched on 19th November. This ambitious ten year plan contains two actions specifically aimed at supporting the development of the Irish language within the early learning and care sector.  These actions are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Introduce measures to ensure that children in Gaeltacht areas have access to Irish-medium ELC provision;<\/p>  <p>  - Develop mechanisms to provide Irish-language supports to ELC provision where there are high proportions of children who are learning through the medium of Irish.<\/p>  <p>   An implementation plan for the actions contained within that Strategy will be published within six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300059#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value for Money Reviews","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300059#WRB04800"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[52295\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300059#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if a value for money review will be undertaken of the national childcare investment programme which operated from 2006 to 2010 with a particular focus on the private sector capital funding element of the programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1362","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>The NCIP (National Childcare Investment Programme, 2006 - 2010) Capital Programme was a strategic infrastructural programme within the childcare sector with an aim to address local needs and meet local demands in the provision of childcare places.<\/p><p>A total of &euro;177.8m was awarded under the programme to 847 childcare facilities.

In situations where the Garda&iacute; are involved they make an assessment of the risk and the most appropriate steps to be taken. <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised that, in these cases social work staff follow Garda instructions, while at all times trying to minimise the difficulties for the child and parent. Taking a child into care is an extraordinary event, and transparency and planning are important. In situations where a child may be at immediate or serious risk, it may not  always be appropriate to communicate plans to parents in advance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300059#WRB06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300060#WRC00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300060#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[52493\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300060#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the position regarding the restoration of pay for members of the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>Similar to other sectors in\u00a0the\u00a0public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the\u00a0measures to assist in stabilising national finances during the financial crisis.\u00a0<\/p><p>The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a fair and sustainable recovery in public service pay scales. <\/p><p>Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces\u00a0and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.\u00a0The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. <\/p><p>Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.<\/p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. It is estimated that almost 400,000 people have died, and 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.<\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300060#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300060#WRC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[52631\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300060#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the issues discussed at the recent Foreign and General Affairs Councils; the outcome of such discussions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday 10 December.

I have therefore consulted with the Central Bank on the matters raised by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that the Solvency II Directive represented a substantial overhaul of European insurance regulation. It set out new, more comprehensive EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection. The Directive entered into force\u00a0on 1 January 2016, and is transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (SI 485 of 2015).\u00a0\u00a0 All insurance undertakings across the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Directive (with certain limited exceptions). Failure to comply with its duties and obligations can result in the withdrawal of an insurance company&rsquo;s authorisation under Article 144 of the Directive. Further detailed provisions are also in place around their capital requirements and what happens should they breach them (Articles 136 to 143).<\/p>  <p>  A central element of Solvency II Directive is that it allows an insurance undertaking authorised in one member state to conduct business in another EU\/EEA state either through:<\/p>  <p>  - establishing a branch operation in the host country and thus conducting business on a &lsquo;freedom of establishment&rsquo; (FOE) basis; or<\/p>  <p>  - writing business from the home country (i.e. where authorised) into the host country on a &lsquo;freedom of services&rsquo; (FOS) basis.<\/p>  <p>  Where an insurer conducts business in this State either through FOE or FOS, the supervisory authority who has authorised the company (Home supervisor) is responsible for the prudential supervision and regulation of the Irish business of such undertakings. \u00a0However,\u00a0I have been informed that the Central Bank actively engages with the National Supervisory Authorities of all entities writing material levels of business in Ireland in order to keep itself up to date on developments.

It is important therefore that EU supervisors properly and consistently supervise the insurers that they authorise, and that there is greater communications between supervisors across the EU about their respective companies conducting cross-border business. It should be noted that as part of the ongoing review\u00a0of the European Supervisory architecture, there is a proposal to further improve cross-border co-operation and communication through the strengthening of Cross-Border Collaboration Platforms. These already operate on an ad-hoc basis, however this proposal would ensure a more formal structure is put in place where an insurer is doing a lot of cross border business.

I have therefore consulted with the Central Bank on the matters raised by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised me that all firms conducting business within the EU must comply with the requirements of the Solvency II Directive, which came into force from 1 January 2016. Solvency II was designed to modernise supervision, deepen market integration and increase the competitiveness of European insurers. <\/p>  <p>  EIOPA is part of the European System of Financial Supervision which is an integrated network of national and European supervisory authorities that provides the necessary links between the macro and micro prudential levels, leaving day-to-day supervision to the national level. <\/p>  <p>  EIOPA&rsquo;s core responsibilities are to support the stability of the financial system, transparency of markets and financial products as well as the protection of policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries. EIOPA is commissioned to monitor and identify trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities stemming from the micro-prudential level, across borders and across sectors.<\/p>  <p>  EIOPA, where necessary, provides for non-legally binding guidelines and recommendations concerning the implementation of the provisions of the Solvency II Directive and its implementing measures in order to enhance the convergence of supervisory practices. <\/p>  <p>  EIOPA and the supervisory authorities of the Member States collaborate closely with each other to facilitate the supervision of insurance and reinsurance within the EU and including the \u00a0examination of any difficulties, which may arise in the application of the Solvency II Directive.<\/p>  <p>  National Supervisory authorities are required to inform EIOPA of any major difficulties in the application of the Solvency II Directive and both EIOPA and the supervisory authorities of the Member States concerned in such situation shall examine those difficulties as quickly as possible in order to find an appropriate solution. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with their founding EU Regulation (1094\/2010 EU) ,EIOPA may investigate non-application by national supervisory authorities of the Solvency II Regulations, or their application in a way, which appears to be a breach of Union law, resulting in a written recommendation to that supervisory authority. \u00a0Where the competent national authority does not follow the recommendation, the EU Commission may issue a formal opinion taking into account the EIOPA recommendation, requiring the competent authority to take the actions necessary to ensure compliance with Union law.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in exceptional situations of persistent inaction by the competent authority concerned, EIOPA may, as a last resort, adopt decisions addressed to individual financial institutions.\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, EIOPA is required to report regularly and at least every two years to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the progress of the supervisory convergence in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that it fully participates, endorses and supports EIOPA&rsquo;s mandate to contribute to the establishment of high quality common regulatory and supervisory standards and procedures and regularly contributes and provides feedback to enhance such convergence. <\/p>  <p>  In February 2017, EIOPA developed a cross-border platform of cooperation between National Supervisory Authorities, and the Central Bank of Ireland has advised me that they participate fully in these platforms with other relevant supervisory authorities. These platforms provide all National Supervisory Authorities with the opportunity to discuss concerns in relation to specific undertakings, local markets and share general market developments.\u00a0 It should be noted that as part of the ongoing review\u00a0of the European Supervisory architecture, there is a proposal to further improve cross-border co-operation and communication through the strengthening of these Cross-Border Collaboration Platforms in order to give supervisors of countries into which insurance is written a greater insight into how the business is being conducted.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland was also part of the EIOPA working group set up to amend the General Protocol to increase the level of information shared between National Supervisory Authorities. In January 2017, EIOPA revised the General Protocol now called EIOPA Decision on the collaboration of the insurance supervisory authorities. The new Decision addresses new flows of information and increased collaboration between supervisory authorities and strengthens EIOPA&rsquo;s role as the central hub for information collection and sharing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300060#WRC06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[52647\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300060#WRC06900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if managing general agents in the insurance industry have a role in ensuring the companies they represent are financially healthy or acting in compliance with European regulations; the level of regulation in place for such agents here; if the Central Bank has a register of such agents; the number operating here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>At the outset I would like to say that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and have no role in the day to day supervision of insurance companies.

In the case of freedom of service business the role of a managing general agent (MGA) is in general terms, to provide access to the market for the cross border insurer. In carrying out this function it must comply with the relevant domestic insurance distribution legislation and the conduct of business rules. While an MGA has a responsibility to its consumers to treat them in a fair and transparent way, and it is in their interests to be selling products from a financially sound insurer, it has no insight into the underlying financial health of such companies other than \u00a0any publically available information. In addition the overarching prudential framework (Solvency II) is designed to provide them with the necessary certainty that any insurer they act on behalf of is financially sound <\/p><p>Despite the many safeguards in the solvency framework which are designed to minimise the likelihood of insurance failure and the costs to policyholders in the event of failure, it should be noted that Solvency II is not a 'no-failure' regime. It is not possible to build a viable system that provides a cast iron guarantee that no insurer will ever fail. Solvency II is a risk based approach and it is not feasible for insurers to hold sufficient capital to cover every possible event. Instead, it provides that sufficient capital be held in order to ensure that insurers will be in a position, with a probability of 99.5%, to meet their obligations to policyholders and beneficiaries over the following 12 months. \u00a0In the design of any regulatory system, it must be kept in mind that protection comes at a cost, in other words the higher the level of the guarantee, the higher the cost to policyholders and the economy as a whole. A balance has to be struck in order that insurers can offer affordable, yet sufficiently safe insurance products.<\/p><p>The Deputy should also note that the Central Bank actively engages with the National Supervisory Authorities of all entities writing material levels of business into the Irish market. I understand that it has developed close working relations and established regular contact with the Home Authorities to discuss concerns, issues and market changes and challenges.<\/p><p>In relation to the regulation of MGA&rsquo;s the Central Bank is the competent authority in Ireland for the authorisation and supervision of insurance intermediaries under the European Communities (Insurance Distribution) Regulations 2018 (IDR).\u00a0 The supervision process for an insurance intermediary mirrors the general supervision approach of the Central Bank.\u00a0 This general supervision approach seeks to ensure that all regulated financial services providers meet their responsibilities to have strong management, internal control and compliance procedures in place, and have people of integrity and competence at all levels in their organisations.<\/p><p>The Central Bank recently published the findings from a thematic inspection of Retail Intermediaries acting as Managing General Agents (MGAs).\u00a0 The report can be found here:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The Central Bank maintains a register of Insurance Intermediaries that is publically available on its website.\u00a0 As MGAs are authorised under the IDR they are included in this register.

On the other hand, however, Ireland is a major beneficiary of the cross border passporting regime particularly on the Life insurance side. In addition, as you are aware all interested observers of the Irish motor insurance market in recent years have been signalling the need to make it more competitive\u00a0by encouraging new entrants. Generally because of the relatively small scale of the Irish market most new entrants will be freedom of service operators. Consequently, whilst there are undoubtedly some problems with the passporting model, it is likely that consumers would have greater difficulty getting competitively priced cover in its absence.<\/p><p>In relation to engaging at European level, my officials attend the Commission Expert Group on Insurance issues which is held at least three times per year (e.g. 6 February, 29 May and 20 September 2018 this year). \u00a0This Group provides a forum to discuss issues such as\u00a0the consistent application of Solvency II as well as proposals for any amendments to the Directive including Commission Delegated Regulations.

However, there have been a number of reports and initiatives in this area in recent years including:<\/p><p>- A 2010 Commission white paper on the introduction of an EU wide framework of Insurance Guarantee Systems. No significant progress was made on this framework subsequently as the development of Solvency II was the priority piece of work.<\/p><p>- A 2015 Commission discussion paper on the possibility of introducing a recovery and resolution regime for insurance undertakings which could include an Insurance guarantee Scheme.<\/p><p>- In 2017 the Commission issued a questionnaire to all Member States seeking information on Recovery and Resolution including experiences with failures and near-failures of insurers.<\/p><p>- The European Systemic Risk Board published a report &ldquo;Recovery and Resolution for the EU insurance sector: a macro prudential perspective&rdquo; in August 2017. The Central Bank of Ireland was represented on the drafting team.<\/p><p>- EIOPA published an Opinion to Institutions of the European Union on the Harmonisation of Recovery and Resolution Frameworks for (Re) Insurers (July 2017).<\/p><p>- Work is also underway at an EIOPA level, where a project group has been set up to examine more broadly recovery and resolution within insurance and in relation to Insurance Guarantee Schemes, a discussion paper was published on this topic:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Recently, in May 2018 the European Commission proposed an amendment to the Motor Insurance Directive which would oblige member states to set up Insurance Guarantee Schemes to cover the cost of insolvent motor insurers.

There are a number of reasons why it might be necessary to take a minor into wardship, with some being discharged from wardship when they turn 18. The most common reason is that the child has been awarded substantial damages by the Court and has special housing or care needs. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that wardship is declared only where it is considered to be necessary for the protection and\/or benefit of the child. In the cases where there are ongoing care and related needs, it is often more efficient and less costly to the child if such matters can be looked after by the Wards of Court Office in consultation with the child&rsquo;s guardians and under the direction of the President of the High Court. The guardians appointed by the President of the High Court are usually the child's parents. <\/p>  <p>  The Wards of Court Office appoints a case officer for each ward of court when he\/she is brought into wardship. The case officer meets with the guardian(s) and will liaise with them throughout the wardship to ensure that the care and monetary needs of the child are met, taking into account the initial award. Any questions raised by family members regarding any issue or concern are dealt with by direct contact between the guardian(s) and the case officer. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, wardship funds are not public funds. The funds of a person who is taken into wardship move into the custody and supervision of the High Court which then holds and invests those funds as appropriate for the benefit of the ward. The Courts Service has advised that the management of court funds by the Courts Service is sensitive to, and takes full account of, the needs of the wards of court. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has informed me that a conservative investment policy is followed. When deciding where and how to invest court funds, the overriding objective is the achievement of an optimal total financial return having regard to the need for liquidity and capital security, taking account of income generation and capital growth requirements. Where there is a requirement to generate a higher return to sustain the value of the funds for the longest period possible, such funds are invested in longer term growth and income generating strategies. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I have signed the Commencement Order bringing Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 into operation with effect from 1 October 2018. The Act, which allows courts the power to award periodic payments rather than a lump sum payment in cases of catastrophic injury, will provide much needed financial security to persons requiring lifelong care and assistance following a catastrophic injury. I believe that the availability of a periodic payment to catastrophically injured persons will ensure that they will receive the care and assistance they require for the rest of their lives.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of other legislation, the Deputy will be aware the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for the repeal of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 and the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811. The current Wards of Court system for adults will be phased out over a three year period from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act. The Act offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability. <\/p>  <p>  Each adult ward (a ward who has attained the age of 18 years by the date of commencement of Part 6 of the Act) will be reviewed in accordance with the new system. A ward who is found to have capacity will be discharged from wardship. A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the support option most appropriate to his or her needs. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that no further legislative changes are anticipated at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300061#WRD05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation Provision","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300061#WRD05200"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[52488\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300061#WRD05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans for a new court house in Tralee, County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>As the Deputy\u00a0is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions.  <\/p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that, as part of\u00a0its provincial\u00a0capital building programme, one of the\u00a0objectives\u00a0is to\u00a0provide improved court accommodation in Tralee which\u00a0is one of a number of provincial city\/county town venues nationwide still requiring new or upgraded courthouse accommodation.\u00a0Collectively\u00a0these venues will be the\u00a0next priority for investment in courthouse facilities outside the capital.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Courts Service has advised that it envisages a courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related facilities (consultation rooms, custody facilities, facilities for juries and vulnerable witnesses, and legal practitioner&rsquo;s suites) as being required to meet current and future needs in Tralee and that\u00a0this will require a building significantly larger than the existing courthouse on Ashe Street.

All the information provided to parents about vaccination takes into account the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL).<\/p>  <p>  The Patient Information Leaflet provides information on the vaccine, its uses and on any precautions that require advice from a healthcare professional before it is administered.\u00a0 Therefore, like other countries providing school immunisation programmes, the Patient Information Leaflet\u00a0is replaced by\u00a0an information leaflet\u00a0which provides the same information on the potential side effects of the vaccine in\u00a0a manner that ensures that it is easily understood.<\/p>  <p>  The information is presented in clear and simple language\u00a0which has been\u00a0approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency, ensuring\u00a0that it can be understood by all adults. The Health Information and Quality Authority guide &lsquo;Communicating in plain English&rsquo; (2015), developed in partnership with NALA, states that &ldquo;one in six people find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult: for example, reading a health leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to all school immunisations, parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter. The information packs for all immunisations are standardised nationally. The information booklets include information on all the known potential side effects that can occur after each vaccination (as is the case with the HPV vaccine, Gardasil).\u00a0Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the case that parents are being denied the information on the Patient Information Leaflet.\u00a0 In fact, the HSE parent information leaflet refers parents to the HPV website (hpv.ie) where links to additional information including the licensing documentation, the Summary of Products Characteristics and the Patient Information Leaflet for each vaccine can be found.\u00a0The HPV website has been endorsed by the World Health Organisation.<\/p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised in September 2006 both nationally and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland.\u00a0The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions through this system.\u00a0All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.\u00a0 Gardasil is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.\u00a0 The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information. The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and \/or swelling at the point of injection and fever.\u00a0These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination.\u00a0Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents.\u00a0Mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination are not unusual.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that all medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.\u00a0Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks.\u00a0The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to reassure anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.\u00a0 As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.<\/p>  <p>  I would urge any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination to engage with your family doctor, or alternatively to visit the HPV website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300063#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300063#WRF01900"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[52537\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300063#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the impending retirements of general practitioners at medical centres (details supplied); his plans to ensure that services do not diminish due to possible delays in securing replacement general practitioners; his plans to ensure the recruitment campaign for these specific medical centres is adequate in securing the services required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>As this question relates to\u00a0service matters, I have arranged for it to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300063#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300063#WRF02200"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[52539\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300063#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an application by an organisation (details supplied) for increased funding will be considered based on its increased caseload of psychotherapy in the instances of bereaved children; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the charity provides a service with most referrals originating from hospitals here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>There is no specific funding made available directly by the Department of Health to voluntary organisations.

Since then the HSE established a Rehabilitation Medicine Programme which aims to ensure the optimal care pathway for different clinical needs.  <\/p>  <p>  This Programme provides a national, strategic, and coordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services and includes the standardisation of access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services nationally as well as better linkages with primary care services. The scope of the Programme covers the whole of the patient journey from self-management and prevention through to primary, secondary and tertiary care. <\/p>  <p>  The Model of Care for Neurology was launched by the HSE in late 2016. This was developed by the HSE&rsquo;s National Clinical Programme for Neurology in collaboration with consultants, nurses, health and social care professionals and patient support groups. It aims to address the need for strategic development of neurology services in the provision of better care for these patients.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 a number of significant investments were made for the diagnosis and treatment of a number of neurology related conditions.

This is a key political priority for me and\u00a0the Government. The Taoiseach has described tackling child poverty as a moral imperative and this is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently. Under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020), my Department and other relevant Departments, are taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty. It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed.\u00a0 My officials are working closely with that Department on this important issue.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, the Government set a child-specific poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two-thirds on 2011 levels by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  When we set ourselves this target in 2014, it was a challenging ambition.\u00a0 It aimed to lift 70,000 children out of poverty by 2020.\u00a0 The baseline target against 2011 means that today we need to lift 102,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Consistent poverty means that these children are living in households with incomes below 60% of the national average income and experience deprivation according to official Government indicators.\u00a0 Consistent poverty involves a diverse cohort of children and it is an issue that we are determined to resolve.<\/p>  <p>  We have made some modest progress.\u00a0 From a peak of 152,000 children in consistent poverty in 2014, we have seen a 9% decrease in 2015 of 13,680 children in consistent poverty.\u00a0This downward trend continued with an 11.1% rate of consistent poverty in 2016, a further reduction of 6,320 or 4.5%, with a total of 132,000 children deemed to be in a consistent poverty.\u00a0 I understand that updated child poverty data (Survey on Income and Living Conditions data) for 2017 will be released by the Central Statistics\u00a0 Office next Monday, 17th December.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the target to reduce child poverty by more than 100,000 children, or two thirds of the 2011 rate, is unlikely to be met. However, there is nothing inevitable about child poverty, and there is clear evidence about what works in terms of reducing child poverty rates. Ireland&rsquo;s historical approach to tackling child poverty has focused on cash transfers, and this approach has resulted in Ireland consistently ranking as one of the top performing EU countries in the poverty reduction effect of social transfers.<\/p>  <p>  The paper on the Whole-of-Government Approach to Tackling Child Poverty, which was\u00a0published in October 2017, outlines six key priorities including;<\/p>  <p>  - Providing universal access to GP care for under 18s<\/p>  <p>  - Reducing the cost of education<\/p>  <p>  - Housing<\/p>  <p>  - Affordable childcare<\/p>  <p>  - Labour activation<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of in-work benefits.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These priority actions are being advanced by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Health, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills, through the Better Outcomes, Brighter Future implementation structures.\u00a0While the targets are increasingly challenging, we will continue our work across government on these priority actions to try to ensure that those most impacted by child poverty experience real and positive progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[52672\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which her Department continues to support a group (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.

In recognition of the whole of government approach required, in July 2018, the Taoiseach launched the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19.

These provide for the welfare of the child, including their health, education, assessment of need, care planning, supervision of placement, contact with family, general care practices, care records, and safety precautions. <\/p>  <p>  A range of accommodation is available to meet the needs of children at risk. Children and young people, depending on their identified needs, may be placed\u00a0 in foster care, either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, high support or special care or other placement types. The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care. <\/p>  <p>  A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.<\/p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA). Private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against National Standards. Inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by\u00a0Department officials. The overview of these reports provides\u00a0the Department\u00a0with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children who are at risk.<\/p>  <p>  Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection, and is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians.\u00a0 As of the 30\u00a0September 2018, of the children in care, 92% were in foster care nationally; there were 4,005 children in general foster care, 1,595 in relative care and 374 children were in a residential care placement, with the remaining children in other care placements appropriate to their assessed needs.<\/p>  <p>  There are regular area recruitment campaigns to meet foster care demands. Fostering teams are responsible for the recruitment and assessment of foster carers. When an assessment is complete, a report is presented to the Foster Care Committee who decide whether or not to approve the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and retention of an appropriate range of foster carers is part of Tusla's business plan. Tusla are particularly interested in recruiting foster carers with the skills required to look after children with complex needs, or from a range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.<\/p>  <p>  For children who cannot live either at home or in an alternative family environment such as foster care, there are a number of types of residential care settings that may be appropriate, of which secure care is one type.<\/p>  <p>  A very small number of children (1.6%) are in other care placements.\u00a0 Such placements\u00a0can include supported lodgings, at home under a care order, detention centre\/prison, youth homeless facilities, other residential centres e.g. therapeutic, disability, residential assessment, designated mother and baby units.<\/p>  <p>  It is a fact that sometimes children are detained for their safety in order to provide the care they need.\u00a0 It is used only where a young person's behaviour poses a real and substantial risk of harm to their life, health, safety, development or welfare.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  New regulations were put in place earlier this year.\u00a0 These place special care on a full statutory footing for the first time.\u00a0 The legislation sets a clear time limited and short term period for the use of special care.<\/p>  <p>  Staff working in special care are trained in a range of behaviour management techniques and in de-escalation. As far as possible, staff use the least restrictive practices they can to keep the children safe.\u00a0 However, situations can arise where there is a risk of significant harm\u00a0to self or to others and, in line with policy, may need the assistance of the Garda&iacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection Services Provision","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ02500"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[52677\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which her Department remains in a position to quickly respond to complaints of children at risk with particular reference to the time taken to intervene; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":537,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the statutory body with responsibility for child protection in Ireland.

It is not possible, at present, to indicate a date for the full roll out of training but it is hoped that this can be commenced shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, the GRO, the Department of Health, and the HSE are maintaining their best efforts to ensure that commencement of this legislation can be brought about as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I will arrange for officials from my Department to contact the Deputy to follow up in relation to the circumstances outlined in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Data","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[52486\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300066#WRJ05000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons in County Kerry in receipt of rent allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>At the end of October there were 25,654 recipients of Rent Supplement nationally, of whom 825 were resident in Kerry.<\/p><p>At the same time, there were\u00a071\u00a0recipients of a Rent Allowance payment nationally.

This was also fully surveyed and recorded. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In 2013, the landowners commissioned an environmental impact statement in connection with a peat extraction licence application to the Environmental Protection Agency. As part of the assessment process, the peatlands were fully examined by a qualified archaeological consultant and, aside from the plank togher, no further finds or features of archaeological significance were identified at that time. <\/p>  <p>  In 2014, at my Department&rsquo;s request, another inspection was commissioned by the landowners to assess the status of both toghers.\u00a0 During 2015, and also at the request of my Department, the landowners commissioned a series of excavations which were carried out at three separate locations on both toghers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In 2016, with the permission of the landowners, my Department commissioned an Induced Polarisation Survey (an advanced geophysical technique) to examine an area of high bog to the east of the open industrial bog at Mayne. This methodology was previously used successfully at Edercloon, County Longford, to identify wooden structures outside the road corridor where other parts of the structures were under excavation by the National Roads Authority.\u00a0 Due to the heavily waterlogged nature of the high bog at Mayne, the geophysical survey was inconclusive in tracking the togher into the higher peatlands. During 2017, my Department commissioned a further survey using metal probes inserted through the peat, as developed and employed successfully in research at C&eacute;ide Fields in North Mayo.\u00a0 The survey successfully identified that the togher continues to the east from the edge of the high bog for a minimum distance of 200 metres at depths from the surface varying from 1 to 2.4 metres. <\/p>  <p>  In the course of 2018 my Department licensed\u00a0a further assessment by the landowners of the archaeological potential of the area of the bog\u00a0that is subject to peat extraction.  The fieldwork component of this project has been completed and under the conditions of the licence, the archaeologist is obliged to submit a report to the Department's\u00a0National Monuments Service which will be\u00a0shared with the local authority. <\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0also hopes\u00a0to commission a further\u00a0survey in 2019 of the area of Mayne Bog which has not been subject to peat extraction, with a view to further clarifying the location and state of preservation of the area of trackway in that part of the bog.\u00a0 The\u00a0Department is and will continue to engage with all stakeholders, including the local authority and the landowners, to progress the preservation of the togher in the high bog. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the measures being taken with regard to the protection of the toghers uncovered at Mayne represent the best approach to securing an optimal outcome. Unlike cases involving delivery of key infrastructure which are supported by the Codes of Practice agreed and in place between my Department and the various State utility providers, archeological discoveries arising from private development have to be dealt with on a case by case basis. In such instances the practice is to seek the co-operation of private landowners with the protection and recording of monuments in line, for example, with my Department&rsquo;s engagement with farmers under Glas, the current agri-environmental scheme.\u00a0 Such engagement is undertaken in a collaborative and transparent manner and I am satisfied that it is proving to be the best mechanism for guaranteeing the survival of these monuments into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300067#WRK04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
