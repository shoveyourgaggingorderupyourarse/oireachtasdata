It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.<\/p><p>These decisions are not taken lightly, and I am acutely conscious of the impact it is having on businesses. That is why since the beginning of the pandemic, the Government has worked to support businesses through this difficult time with a comprehensive range of measures for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.

The IDA has a significant role to play in helping us achieve that objective. The Agency has been working hard, through its staff both here and abroad, to encourage overseas investors to locate or expand in Ireland&rsquo;s regions. The Agency&rsquo;s performance in recent years demonstrates that these efforts are producing results. For example, 54,868 jobs were created outside of Dublin over the past five years leading to 33,118 additional direct jobs (net) on the ground in regions at the end of the IDA&rsquo;s 5-year strategy. <\/p><p>Between 2010 and 2019 there were two new name investments located in County Donegal, one each in 2011 and 2012.<\/p><p>These statistics reflect one element of FDI performance, which is not accurately measured by the number of new-name investors.  A more accurate reflection of FDI performance is demonstrated in the Annual Employment Survey which demonstrates a strong performance in Co Donegal over the last decade.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>2010 <\/th>       <th>2011 <\/th>       <th>2012 <\/th>       <th>2013 <\/th>       <th>2014 <\/th>       <th>2015 <\/th>       <th>2016 <\/th>       <th>2017 <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>       <th>2019 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>No.of Companies <\/td>       <td>12 <\/td>       <td>12 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Jobs <\/td>       <td>1,847 <\/td>       <td>2,101 <\/td>       <td>2,223 <\/td>       <td>2,382 <\/td>       <td>2,607 <\/td>       <td>2,925 <\/td>       <td>3,048 <\/td>       <td>3,400 <\/td>       <td>3,506 <\/td>       <td>3,776 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The table above details how Donegal, along with many other parts of the country, has benefitted from this strong regional focus. The County has experienced a significant increase in FDI-driven employment since 2010, with job numbers in IDA client firms there increasing from 1,847 in 2010 to 3,776 at the end of 2019. The County is now home to 13 IDA companies including Abbott, Optum and Pramerica.<\/p><p>The IDA&rsquo;s experience, over many decades, has shown that the growth of existing overseas firms here can produce as many jobs, if not more, than new name investors. That is why the IDA focuses on both supporting the growth and expansion of its current clients here as well as securing new investors to locate for the first time in locations like Donegal. Pursuing that twin-track strategy has helped produce record FDI results in recent years and should lead to further investment and job creation in the years ahead.<\/p><p>While clear progress has been made in creating new jobs and economic opportunity in Donegal, the Government is determined to achieve more. Efforts will continue in 2020 and beyond, whether in support of indigenous or overseas enterprise, to help create more employment and economic opportunities in the County.<\/p><p>In November 2020, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has announced that Swiss Consultancy firm, Pangea is to establish its operational hub for Finance, Human Resources and Operations in the Donegal Gaeltacht in Gweedore. IDA worked in partnership with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to deliver this project.<\/p><p>The number of Site Visits to County Donegal for the period 2010 to 2019 and to date in 2020 are shown below: <table>    <tr>       <th>County <\/th>       <th>2010 <\/th>       <th>2011 <\/th>       <th>2012 <\/th>       <th>2013 <\/th>       <th>2014 <\/th>       <th>2015 <\/th>       <th>2016 <\/th>       <th>2017 <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>       <th>2019 <\/th>       <th>2020 to date <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal <\/td>       <td>4 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>       <td>7 <\/td>       <td>6 <\/td>       <td>5 <\/td>       <td>7 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>       <td>8 <\/td>       <td>12 <\/td>       <td>1 E-Site Visit to Q3<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Last year there were a total 12 site visits to Donegal. The introduction of international travel restrictions related to Covid-19 has, amongst other things, led to the cancellation or postponement of scheduled IDA site visits and client meetings in every region of the country, including Donegal.  <\/p><p>As an alternative to site visits, the IDA has migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. The Agency has developed new digital content and has also put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors. There have been a total of 131 in-person site visits and 101 E-visits nationally as of the third quarter and this is the latest data available.<\/p><p>It should be noted that site visits are one measure only in a company&rsquo;s interest in a particular location and may not necessarily be a true measure of the overall level of foreign direct investment (FDI) activity in a region or county.  Potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once. These figures represent individual visits and are therefore not indicative of the number of companies that have visited. The final decision on where to locate an investment is always decided by the client and not by IDA Ireland.Regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders are important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI and in this respect IDA Ireland continues to engage with Stakeholders as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations to generate additional jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800063#WRE05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800064#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[41726\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800064#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the number of manufacturing start-ups compared to IT companies which have been issued Enterprise Ireland grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>My Department, working through our agency Enterprise Ireland, supports companies throughout the country to start, scale and succeed in international markets.

It applies to businesses who, under the specific terms of the regulations, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict members of the public from accessing their business premises, with the result that the business is required to temporarily close or to operate at significantly reduced levels. Support provided under CRSS is intended to enable businesses to meet normal fixed costs associated with their business premises such as rent, insurance, utilities and so on, during the period which they are subject to such restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Domestic travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, the applicable restrictions should require the business to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing the business premises in which the relevant business activity is carried on.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been an easing of restrictions on businesses, with a phased move to Level 3 restrictions nationally from 1 December, with some restrictions easing from 4 December and 18 December respectively.  Since 1 December, hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;B&rsquo;s have been allowed to reopen to provide accommodation services to the general public. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools, including those within hotels, were also allowed to reopen for individual use. From 4 December, bars, cafes and restaurants (including hotel restaurants and bars) which serve substantial meals prepared onsite are allowed to open for indoor dining. <\/p>  <p>  In most cases, hotels ceased to be significantly restricted from operating from 4 December and therefore cease to qualify for CRSS from that date.  However, a hotel, like other businesses reopening after the period of restrictions, will be eligible to claim an additional week&rsquo;s support under CRSS (referred to as a &lsquo;restart week&rsquo;) to assist the hotel in meeting the costs of reopening. <\/p>  <p>  Depending on the particular trade of a hotel, the hotel may, under the current public health regulations, continue to be subject to some level of restrictions. For example, nightclubs are not allowed to reopen under the current public health regulations and restrictions on indoor gatherings remain, which may impact a hotel with significant conferencing facilities or a hotel whose trade consists substantially of the hosting of large wedding receptions (which are limited to 25 patrons under current regulations). In certain limited cases, restrictions under the current public health regulations might amount to significant restrictions for a hotel, having regard to the mix of its services.  If so, the hotel will continue to be eligible to claim under CRSS.  If a hotel business forms the view that, having regard to the totality of its trade carried on from the hotel premises, it continues to be significantly restricted under the regulations, and therefore is eligible to claim under CRSS, it should retain evidence to support the basis of its claim for future checking by Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Pubs that serve substantial meals prepared on the premises were allowed to reopen on 4 December and therefore, from that date, ceased to qualify for CRSS. However, they are eligible to claim the restart week on reopening.  Pubs that do not serve substantial meals which are prepared on the premises are not allowed to reopen and, therefore, remain eligible to claim under CRSS.  I announced an additional seasonal support for businesses who cannot reopen through December. Payable for a period of three weeks beginning 21 December, the additional support will provide up to double the amount of the weekly CRSS support payment due subject to the statutory maximum payment of &euro;5,000 per week. <\/p>  <p>  This additional seasonal support is being made available in recognition of the additional financial impact on those business of being closed at Christmas time, which for many would be a particularly busy trading period.  All businesses benefiting from this additional seasonal support will still qualify for the additional &lsquo;restart week&rsquo; under CRSS once they can reopen.<\/p>  <p>  Any business that can reopen without having to prohibit or significantly restrict access to their business premises, but chooses not to reopen, will not be eligible to claim under CRSS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800067#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[41331\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800067#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider tax breaks and reliefs for workers who have incurred additional individual travel costs due to the reduction in carpooling to work during the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>\u00a0As the Deputy will be aware, employees may claim a tax deduction in respect of (a) the cost of travelling expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of their employment or office; and (b) the cost of other expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal.

In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.

Ulster Bank also confirmed that there is no set timetable for this review and that it is fully aware of the strategically important role that Ulster Bank plays in the provision of financial services to the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  The continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market would be the most welcome outcome. Ulster Bank is a significant employer\u00a0with 2800 employees and has 88 branches across the country. Ulster Bank is also important in terms of providing competition in the Irish retail banking market.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of direct knowledge about NatWest&rsquo;s strategic review of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s operations,\u00a0I cannot and will not comment\u00a0or speculate on\u00a0possible outcomes as\u00a0there is no basis for such speculation, which would be open to misinterpretation.<\/p>  <p>  While I will have further engagement with the bank as the review process continues, I would like to emphasise that I have no role in the review or any commercial decisions arising from it. My officials will continue to monitor developments.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the responsibility for competition policy rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body that is responsible for the enforcement of competition law in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is concentrated by international standards, with five retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending, and three retail banks accounting for the majority of new bank lending to SMEs. However, the wider context is one of improving competition in the provision of financial services, with new entrants to both bank and non-bank lending markets for households and businesses in Ireland already announced.\u00a0 Indeed,\u00a0it is\u00a0a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the\u00a0market.\u00a0 This\u00a0will be of benefit to\u00a0new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Price competition is possible even in a concentrated system. It should be noted that recent\u00a0trends indicate\u00a0that rates have been falling. For example, interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.64% in\u00a0September of this year. There have also been reductions in interest rates on loans to SMEs from 5.19% to 4.33% over the period Q1 2015 to Q2 2020, as well as reductions in interest rates on consumer loans (for example, from 8.3 to 7.54% on APRC consumer loans from January 2015 to September 2020).<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Finance published a paper in 2019 by Indecon Consulting on an Evaluation of the Concept of Community Banking in Ireland. This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by the Department of Finance in 2018. The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.\u00a0 Indecon&rsquo;s report also\u00a0noted that there is extensive provision of and access to banking services through some 1,900 bank branches, credit union offices and An Post branches across the country, as well as a wide range of Exchequer funded existing supports.<\/p>  <p>  Credit unions are increasing the offering of financial products for their members. The\u00a0Credit Union Act,\u00a01997\u00a0(the 1997 Act) and the\u00a0Credit Union Act 1997\u00a0(Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016\u00a0set out the services\u00a0that credit unions may provide to their members. These include loans and\u00a0savings under the 1997 Act and a further suite of services under the 2016\u00a0Regulations such as third party payments; ATM services; bureau de change and\u00a0certain insurance services on an agency basis. I understand that a number\u00a0of credit unions provide some of the services provided for under the 2016\u00a0Regulations. Where a credit union wishes to provide other services to its\u00a0members, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to\u00a0provide such services in accordance with the provisions set out in\u00a0sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.<\/p>  <p>  One such additional service\u00a0includes the Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS). In 2016, the\u00a0Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as\u00a0MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current\u00a0accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services\u00a0within an appropriate risk framework. To date, 54 credit unions have been\u00a0approved to provide MPCAS.<\/p>  <p>  An Post offers financial\u00a0services including a payment account, personal loans, credit cards, a range of insurances, money transmission and foreign exchange services. An\u00a0Post offers counter services for a number of retail banks, allowing\u00a0customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches. There is there is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within five kilometres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800067#WRJ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800067#WRJ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[41227\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800067#WRJ05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his Department&rsquo;s current projection of the extent to which the economy will contract in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>The latest data shows the economy recovered in the third quarter of this year, with GDP increasing by 11 per cent relative to the previous quarter, following the sharp decline seen in the second quarter, a pattern seen in all economies. As a result, GDP was 8.1 per cent higher on an annual basis. However, as has been well documented GDP is not an accurate measure of what is going on in the domestic economy, given the size of the multinational sector. In the third quarter, modified domestic demand &ndash; a proxy for the domestic economy &ndash; was down -2.4 per cent year-on-year, with personal consumption down by -5.7 per cent and (modified) investment down by -4.4 per cent. On the other hand, exports were up 5.5 per cent, due to strong growth in the multinational dominated pharmaceutical sector.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, a contraction in the domestic economy is expected for the fourth quarter as a result of the move to Level 5 of the Living with Covid Plan.

In the labour market, while the numbers of persons in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment has increased by around 105,000 to 350,000 since Level 5 restrictions were introduced, the overall number of recipients has remained well below the peak of 600,000 in early May.<\/p>  <p>  While GDP growth may in the end be positive for the year, modified domestic demand will almost certainly still be negative, in line with previous expectations, with private consumption expected to be particularly hard-hit from the restrictions.

This approach is intended to reduce the risk of fraud for all types of electronic payments (especially online payments) and to protect the confidentiality of the user&rsquo;s financial data.<\/p>  <p>  PSPs are obliged to apply strong customer authentication (SCA) when a payer initiates an electronic payment transaction. SCA under PSD2 requires the customer to go through two-factor authentication made up of elements from two of three separate categories: knowledge, possession, and inherence. SCA is a combination of something you know (a password or PIN), something you have (a card reader or token generator) and something you are (a fingerprint).<\/p>  <p>  The European Banking Authority (EBA) was tasked with developing standards for strong customer authentication and secure communication. These standards were published on 13 March 2018 and came into effect from 14 September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In an Opinion published on 16 October 2019 the EBA set the final deadline for full compliance with SCA requirements at 31 December 2020. The EBA felt that this time should be sufficient for issuing and acquiring payment service providers and their merchants to migrate to SCA-compliant approaches and solutions.<\/p>  <p>  Following the outbreak of Covid-19 earlier this year industry bodies from across the EU, including the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI), wrote to the EU Commission and the EBA seeking a further extension to the deadline for compliance with the SCA requirements. They outlined that Covid-19 was clearly having an impact on all sectors of the EU economy and that industry was unlikely to be able to meet the current deadline of 31 December 2020 for SCA migration.<\/p>  <p>  Where a regulated payment service provider (PSP) is in a position to implement the requirements with effect from 1 January 2021, the Central Bank expects them to do so, in a manner that does not cause customer detriment.<\/p>  <p>  Through engagements with regulated PSPs on the progress of their SCA migration plans, the Central Bank is aware of some issues around the full implementation of SCA by 31 December 2020. The Central Bank has communicated to these PSPs that they are required to implement the Requirements as soon as possible in a manner that does not cause customer detriment.<\/p>  <p>  As the deadline for SCA implementation approaches, Department officials will continue to work with the Central Bank and BPFI to minimise payment disruption experienced by consumers and merchants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800067#WRJ06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":421,"content":"<p>Question No. 180 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":422,"content":"<p>Question No. 181 answered with Question No. 177.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":423,"content":"<p>Question No. 182 answered with Question No. 166.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800068#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[41366\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800068#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to address the issue of life assurance providers delaying coverage to those with a 100% loading due to the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[42135\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800068#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of persons with underlying health conditions who are currently struggling to obtain life assurance due to the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 200 together.<\/p>  <p>  While I have an appreciation of the difficulties individuals may find themselves in as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.\u00a0 Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions apply.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance and what terms to apply.\u00a0 These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle.\u00a0 In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.\u00a0 In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule.\u00a0 In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  My officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers on this issue.\u00a0 It stated that while most customers are still\u00a0able to get life; critical illness; or mortgage protection insurance at this challenging time it is aware\u00a0of a\u00a0small number\u00a0of cases where\u00a0a\u00a0final decision on some applications is being postponed for\u00a0a\u00a0period\u00a0of\u00a0time where applicants have an underlying health condition. However, it stated that while unaware\u00a0of\u00a0any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on\u00a0a\u00a0case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions, will be taken into account by\u00a0the\u00a0underwriters,\u00a0as\u00a0was\u00a0the\u00a0case pre-COVID-19. Insurance Ireland further noted that it understands that mortgage protection is not\u00a0a\u00a0universal requirement by banks, who\u00a0in\u00a0practice apply\u00a0the\u00a0following exceptions to holding life cover when an applicant applies for\u00a0a\u00a0mortgage:<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0applicant already has sufficient life cover.<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0applicant is over age 50.<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0mortgage is not on\u00a0the\u00a0applicant&rsquo;s principal private residence.<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0applicant cannot get insurance, or only at\u00a0a\u00a0much higher rate than normal.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this,\u00a0the\u00a0Deputy will be aware that both I and Minister\u00a0of\u00a0State Fleming have consistently and publicly stated that\u00a0in the\u00a0context\u00a0of COVID-19\u00a0we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and\u00a0in\u00a0accordance with\u00a0the\u00a0Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. \u00a0The Government will continue to work to protect customers during and after the COVID-19 crisis, and engage with the insurance industry in relation to how it responds to the needs of its customers. This commitment is included in the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by\u00a0a\u00a0particular insurance provider, they have\u00a0the\u00a0option\u00a0of\u00a0making\u00a0a\u00a0complaint to\u00a0the\u00a0Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).\u00a0The\u00a0FSPO acts\u00a0as\u00a0an independent arbiter\u00a0of\u00a0disputes which consumers\u00a0may\u00a0have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.\u00a0The\u00a0FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800068#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Laundering","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800068#WRK00900"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[41376\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800068#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to introduce laundered diesel testing as a core component of the national car test and commercial vehicle road tests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1497","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it does not have any plans to introduce laundered diesel testing as part of the NCT and DOE road tests. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Revenue takes a multifaceted approach to tackling the misuse of fuel. Its compliance activities in this area include roadside sampling of private and commercial vehicles at checkpoints combined with a risk based targeted sampling programme based on enhanced supply chain reporting for suppliers and retailers. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it conducted a random National Sampling Programme in the years 2016 to 2019 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The 2019 programme involved samples being taken from over 200 randomly selected licenced fuel outlets and transport sector trades. Evidence of misuse of fuel was discovered in only 3 cases. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The results represent confirmation of the effectiveness of the various measures introduced by Revenue in recent years to enhance compliance in the fuel trade and among users of diesel. The random sampling programme results do not signify the complete elimination of the illicit trade in fuel. However, they do demonstrate that systematic selling of illicit fuel through retail outlets and its use in the transport sector is negligible. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Despite this success, I am assured by Revenue that combating such criminality continues to be a priority. Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against cross-border fuel crime and also cooperate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers transparency and value for money outcomes.<\/p><p>Regulation\u00a067 of the SI 286 of 2016 - European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations\u00a0sets out that the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) should be assessed on the basis of the best price-quality ratio, which should always include a price or cost element.\u00a0 It is important to note that the Regulations do not preclude the use of cost as the sole criterion in a MEAT award.\u00a0 It is for contracting authorities to determine the award criteria to identify the MEAT to meet their particular requirements in relation to the contract. The procurement directive applies to all public works contracts with a value in excess of &euro;5.35m and construction-related services with a value in excess of &euro;139k for Government Departments and Bodies and &euro;214k for Local Authorities.<\/p><p>The general requirements for works and works-related contracts are set out in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF). The CWMF represents the tools that a public body must use to procure and manage the external resources necessary to deliver a public works project that is to be delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan. This guidance incorporates key elements of EU legislation that have been transposed into Irish law and is complemented by circulars and guidance issued by this Department and the Office of Government Procurement.<\/p><p>The award criterion for works contracts (above &euro;1m) and for the engagement of consultants under the CWMF is the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) meeting the specified minimum criteria (if any). The MEAT is determined in accordance with the award criteria set out in the Particulars to the standard CWMF Instructions to Tenderer. The award criterion associated with the form of\u00a0contract most commonly used for works below &euro;1m is the lowest price.<\/p><p>Generally speaking where public works are concerned, the better defined the project requirements the greater the weighting that should be given to price. Under the CWMF, works projects that are delivered using the traditional approach are required to be well defined prior to tender.\u00a0 In these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate for price to be given a majority weighting. In a design and build contract, where the contractor is required to prepare the design as part of their tender submission the majority weighting should be given to quality (or technical merit).\u00a0 A majority weighting for quality should properly interrogate the innovation, technical achievements and durability of the solutions offered. There is a balance to be struck in deciding to award a public contract between value for money and a quality project outcome. \u00a0<\/p><p>The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.\u00a0 It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.<\/p><p>A review of the policies and practices deployed in the procurement of public works projects commenced in March 2019 and is ongoing.\u00a0 The review is being conducted by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) with the support of the Government Construction Contracts Committee (GCCC).

The initial focus of the review is on the procurement of consultancy services. Overall improvement in project definition is required &ndash; to be delivered through establishing minimum standards for information at the different stages of a project&rsquo;s development.<\/p><p>The OGP has developed a high-level strategy with the GCCC to guide the implementation which will be addressed primarily through the progressive refinement and enhancement of the CWMF.\u00a0 The following objectives summarise the strategy:<\/p><p>The CWMF will enable the delivery of sustainable assets under the NDP by: <\/p><p>- Developing procurement and contracting\u00a0strategies that prioritise quality\u00a0solutions and support the most efficient means of delivery;\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Embedding\u00a0appropriate risk management measures within the project development, procurement and construction stages;<\/p><p>- Deploying\u00a0digital solutions throughout the project delivery stages.<\/p><p>The review will deliver significant changes to the CWMF over the coming years. The OGP has prepared a methodology for extensive structured engagement, both with industry stakeholders, and with the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects to inform the implementation of the strategy. It is planned to publish a series of position papers on a broad range of issues to foster debate and engagement on specific issues such as:<\/p><p>- price variation;<\/p><p>- risk management;<\/p><p>- reflecting\u00a0quality in the award of contracts;<\/p><p>- adoption\u00a0of Building Information Modelling (BIM) on public works projects;<\/p><p>- liability,\u00a0indemnity and insurance requirements;<\/p><p>- performance\u00a0evaluation;<\/p><p>- encouraging\u00a0collaborative working.<\/p><p>Upon conclusion of the consultation period for each issue, the GCCC will prepare a recommendation for approval at the appropriate level.\u00a0 It is envisaged that the process of engagement will extend over the next 12 &ndash; 18 months, however where the GCCC&rsquo;s recommendations are accepted they may be implemented without waiting for the entire process to conclude providing it is practicable to do so.<\/p><p>The onset of Covid-19 impacted on the conduct of the review both in terms of engagement with stakeholders and reassignment of internal resources in order to address the impact of the shutdown and the restart phase on the NDP.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":481,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL01500"},{"type":"question","counter":482,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[41123\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason Vote 12 was transferred from his Department Vote group to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2011.","asker":"1485","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":483,"content":"<p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) was established in 2011 to reduce public spending to more sustainable levels and to reform and improve our public services under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the establishment of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, certain functions primarily focussed on expenditure including Vote 12 Superannuation and Retired Allowances were transferred from Minister for Finance and these functions are outlined in Section 9 of the above Act entitled &ldquo;Transfer of certain other functions to Minister&rdquo;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL01800"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[41412\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the list of flood relief projects that are expected to commence in 2021; and the estimated completion timeframe for each flood relief project.

If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has specifically referred to individuals who retired in 2008. In that context, it is necessary to distinguish between those who retired before 1 March 2012 and those who retired after that date.<\/p>  <p>  Generally, individuals who retired pre-March 2012 will have retired either before imposition of the first FEMPI pay reduction in 2010 or they were protected by the first 'grace period' so their pension does not reflect this reduction. As a result, some pensioners in this cohort are not eligible for pension increases arising from PSSA increases to serving staff as the salary on which their pension is based is still higher than the salary of serving staff on the same grade\/scale point. <\/p>  <p>  Individuals who retired from 1 March 2012 onwards retired either before the second round of FEMPI reductions were imposed in July 2013, were not affected by this second round of reductions as it only applied to salaries above &euro;65,000, or the salary on which their pension is based does not reflect these reductions as a result of the second 'grace period'. Given that the salary on which their pension is based encompasses the first FEMPI reduction in 2010, this cohort of retirees are generally eligible for pension increases arising from PSSA pay increases as their pensionable salary will be lower than the salary of serving staff, following each of those pay increases.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I note that the question asks about pension increases in the &lsquo;public sector&rsquo;, which is generally understood as including the commercial semi State bodies. Under the various pension scheme rules operational to such bodies, in the first instance, it is a matter for the Government Department under whose aegis responsibility for individual commercial semi State Bodies falls to consider and approve any pension increase sought, with the consent of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform. Obviously, as part of such decisions, account must also be taken of the overall funding position in the relevant pension funds prior to taking any decisions on pension increases. The impact of pension increases on the sustainability of pension funds is an important overall consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL03300"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[41682\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a review of the status of a person (details supplied) in 1989 has been considered; if his attention has been drawn to the full status of their employment with the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>My Department has no role in this matter and it should be referred to\u00a0my colleague the Minister for Justice in the first instance.\u00a0<\/p><p>I understand\u00a0that this matter\u00a0has been the subject of extensive correspondence with the party in question and that the position has been outlined in correspondence including a number of\u00a0Parliamentary Questions to the Minister\u00a0for Justice dating from 2014 to 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL03600"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[41720\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800069#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a copy of the five-case review that examined five OPW property acquisitions to identify accountability vulnerabilities will be provided.

Its membership includes a range of Government Departments, Agencies whose remit covers aspects of the Night-time Economy and who have valuable input to contribute from a legislative and or policy perspective. The Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Cork are also members of the Taskforce given the significant experience in developing the Night-time Economy in Dublin and Cork.  Give us the Night are also represented on the Taskforce.  Give us the Night is an independent volunteer group of professionals operating within the night-time industry and articulates the views of this Sector to the wider Taskforce.  I am confident that the Taskforce represents a wide range of policy perspectives on the Night-time Economy and I look forward to the outcome of their work.<\/p><p>As part of their work, I have asked the Taskforce to conduct an intensive stakeholder engagement process with all relevant sectors and interested parties who have a significant role in the night-time economy to ensure that all views and ideas are considered by the Taskforce.  Well over 100 stakeholders from community organisations, business and industry, civic society, cultural sector and sporting organisations were invited to submit their views.  Some 58 submissions were received as part of this process and the responses are currently being considered by the Taskforce.  <\/p><p>As part of this process, the Taskforce has currently invited a number of groups to present their views to the Group over the course of December.  They have already heard from the HSE Alcohol and Mental Health Programme, the HSE National Social Inclusion Office, Alcohol Action Ireland and the Purple Flag Initiative.  Further presentations from Groups representing the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well as groups representing a resident's association and events and entertainment industries will also be part of this process.  The Taskforce may also invite further groups in to present their views as they develop their work.<\/p><p>The Taskforce will review the results of the consultation process and is also considering the development of a focus group structure to look at some of the findings and see how they can progress the various issues arising.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations.<\/p><p>With regard to exemptions for solar panels, Class 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides an exemption for the installation or erection of a solar panel on, or within the curtilage of a house or any buildings within the curtilage of a house, subject to certain siting and size conditions. <\/p><p>Class 56 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides an exemption for the installation or erection on a business premises or industrial\/light industrial building, or any ancillary buildings within the curtilage of such premises or building, of solar panels (thermal collector or photo-voltaic), subject to certain siting and size conditions.<\/p><p>Furthermore, Class 18 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides an exemption for the installation or erection on an agricultural structure, or within the curtilage of an agricultural holding, of solar panels (thermal collector or photo-voltaic), again subject to a number of conditions. <\/p><p>As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations - to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate more widespread generation of energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review, which continues to be shaped by recommendations of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.<\/p><p>The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for &quot;glint and glare&quot; impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department is presently engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport\/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. As such, these maps, which are a fundamental aspect of any amendments to the exemptions, are expected to be finalised in Q3 2021.<\/p><p>As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. The draft regulations will also be subject to environmental assessment reporting considerations before being finalised and signed into force.

As part of this, measures and proposals to support more serviced sites closer to urban settlements such as towns and villages will be examined, within the broader context of the issues effecting such places as already outlined. It is anticipated that any recommendations forthcoming from the TCF approach will be developed over the next six months.<\/p>  <p>The NPF acknowledges that rural settlements are not suitable for a suburban or a high density approach to development and tailored design approaches are needed. As such, this initiative is intended to address rural-focused issues with a view to supporting settlements at risk of vacancy and decline. The NPF also recognises that in rural Ireland many people seek to have an opportunity to build their own homes.\u00a0 Under National Policy Objective 18b my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.<\/p>  <p>  Consideration will also need to be given to the expansion of towns and villages in a sustainable manner.\u00a0 Such development will be incremental, small scale, walkable (including to and from the town\/village centre) and will occur on sites that have access adequate water supply and provision for disposal of domestic effluent.\u00a0 Such extensions should also be guided by responsive design principles so that they appear as a natural extensions to the town\/village with a close visual relationship to the prevailing vernacular.\u00a0 My Department is addressing this in the context the development of proposed\u00a0&lsquo;sustainable settlement guidance&rsquo;.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800072#WRO04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":664,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800072#WRO05000"},{"type":"question","counter":665,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[41447\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800072#WRO05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress to date in expanding the role of vacant homes officers in local authorities and support local authorities to bring vacant stock into productive use as outlined in the Programme for Government.

For example, the 2015 scheme was intended to be financed by the interest payable on deposits lodged; this is no longer viable, given the current financial market conditions. <\/p><p>Furthermore, it is noteworthy that disputes relating to deposits are no longer the most common dispute type referred to the RTB. Prior to 2013, deposit retention had been the most common dispute type. However, deposit retention is now the third most common rental dispute type, included in 20% of dispute applications in 2019. \u00a02019 saw 364,099 registered tenancies with the RTB of which there were 6,185 applications for dispute resolution and, among those, 1,264 pertained to deposit retention issues &ndash; this correlates with 0.35% of tenancies overall. (In terms of case outcomes, in 73% of cases in 2019, it was found that the deposit should be fully or partially refunded to the tenant, which compares to 80% in 2018.) <\/p><p>Financing the operation of the scheme is an important\u00a0consideration, particularly in terms of ensuring that the likely outcomes of a new scheme are achieved efficiently and effectively and that the best value from public funds is secured. Careful consideration is therefore required to introduce any necessary reforms and enhancements to the 2015 scheme, with a view to considering whether and how to introduce a re-designed scheme that is fit for purpose and suitable for current and future rental and financial markets.\u00a0<\/p><p>Any review of the scope and provisions of a Deposit Protection scheme will need to take account of changes in the residential sectors since the 2015 Deposit Protection Scheme legal provisions were enacted, to inform any necessary legislative change. Consideration will need to be given as to whether or not it is feasible to proceed to revise and implement a deposit protection scheme at this time, or to\u00a0defer to a later point in time, when the\u00a0RTB's Change Management Plan has been fully implemented and more robust data and information is available for consideration.<\/p><p>The RTB has cut case times for deposit-related disputes as the introduction of new processes has borne fruit and the question of proportionality is key and it is imperative to question whether the scale of spending and intervention required is commensurate with the scale of the issue. From a value-for-money perspective at a time when the rental market is experiencing extreme pressure in terms of supply and costs, the introduction of a deposit protection scheme would require careful consideration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800072#WRO05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Compulsory Purchase Orders","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800072#WRO05600"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[41449\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800072#WRO05700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress to date in reforming and consolidating compulsory purchase order laws as outlined in the Programme for Government.

scheme.\u00a0 This information is available on the Agency's website at the following link:<\/p><p>. \u00a0<\/p><p>A Review of the\u00a0MTR scheme\u00a0for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions published in February 2017 explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and identified a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.\u00a0 My Department and the Housing Agency have\u00a0worked with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.\u00a0 As a result of the improvements implemented, an upward trend in case completions has been evident since 2018.<\/p><p>The MTR Review taking account of capacity within the\u00a0Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector, also recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet\u00a0potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale.\u00a0 An\u00a0Expressions of Interest\u00a0(EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model.<\/p><p>Under this alternatively funded model,\u00a0a participant from the private sector\u00a0purchases a property or properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home.\u00a0 The outcome from the\u00a0EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model\u00a0was announced\u00a0in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.<\/p><p>AHBs are\u00a0an integral part of the MTR scheme and their participation in the scheme has enabled and continues to enable a significant number of borrowers to remain in their homes as social housing tenants.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The primary difference between an\u00a0AHB acquiring a property under the MTR scheme and a private company\u00a0acquiring a property is\u00a0that in the private company's\u00a0case private funding is used to purchase the MTR property as opposed to Exchequer funding.\u00a0 The same MTR eligibility criteria apply and the social housing tenant status of those entering the scheme are the same.\u00a0<\/p><p>The MTR process involves the Housing Agency commissioning an independent property valuation and it is on the basis of this valuation that\u00a0MTR providers, both AHBs and Home for Life Ltd.,\u00a0are invited to express an interest in a particular property.\u00a0 Should\u00a0more than one provider\u00a0express an interest in a particular property, the Housing\u00a0Agency then randomly selects the provider and assigns the case to that provider.<\/p><p>In addition, any MTR provider may\u00a0work directly with lenders to develop joint-agreements to purchase properties at discounts on market values.\u00a0 Such an approach can achieve a greater number of successful MTR cases as well as the benefit of discounted purchase prices.<\/p><p>Given the nature of the individual property transaction underpinning MTR,\u00a0the decision to purchase a property under the MTR scheme is a matter\u00a0for\u00a0the MTR provider.\u00a0 In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focussed on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to strengthen\u00a0the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it. Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since 2017,\u00a0my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency to identify any further\u00a0improvements\u00a0required to the scheme.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800072#WRO06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment","counter":678,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800073#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":679,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[41548\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800073#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his ministerial regulations allow a single person who requires an apartment on their own on medical grounds, for example, cystic fibrosis, access a higher level of housing assistance payment than is normal for a single person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":680,"content":"<p>Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a form of social housing support for people, including people with disabilities, who have a long-term housing need.

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern. In order to provide a better understanding on this matter, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) and the HSE have jointly commissioned a detailed review of recent deaths in homeless services. It is important that we establish\u00a0the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response as policy makers and elected representatives on the best\u00a0knowledge and evidence available.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit into permanent housing solutions and that those with complex health and mental health needs are provided with the supports they need. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in respect of these issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs.\u00a0It commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided. The provision of addiction and mental health supports has featured prominently in meetings of the High Level Homelessness Task Force that I established and in my regular interactions with the Minister for Health. The issue of deaths in homeless services has also been\u00a0discussed at the Task Force.<\/p>  <p>  Engaging with rough sleepers is vital. This engagement is first and foremost to encourage those rough sleeping to avail of shelter.\u00a0 But critically, it also allows their health needs to be assessed and provided for.<\/p>  <p>  As we move further into the winter months, cold weather arrangements are in place nationally. My Department is providing funding to allow for an increase in the overall bed capacity, the provision of 24 hour services in facilities with meals provided, and enhancements to outreach operations. The DRHE, which has responsibility for over 70% of all homeless persons nationally, has assured me that sufficient capacity exists in services to ensure that no person should sleep outside for the need of an emergency bed.<\/p>  <p>  My Department publishes a detailed monthly report on homelessness,\u00a0based on data provided by housing authorities. The Report outlines\u00a0details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.<\/p>  <p>  While the information requested by the Deputies is not collated by my Department, I understand that the Department of Health has commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a one-year feasibility study to collect data on deaths among people who were homeless. I have been advised that the research will apply the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, commenced earlier this year and will review approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800073#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800073#WRP01600"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[41922\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800073#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 239 of 26 November 2020, when applicants for funding can expect to hear from the NPWS; if the funding set aside will be enough to cover the applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":692,"content":"<p>Applications for the emergency funding scheme for zoos, announced on the 21st November,\u00a0have been\u00a0received to date from 64 establishments.\u00a0Under the scheme, these zoos and aquaria are\u00a0allocated an amount of\u00a0funding based on the size and costs involved in maintaining the welfare of their animal collections.<\/p><p>&euro;500,000 has been set aside for small and medium zoos while an amount of &euro;1.1 million will be divided between Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park, reflecting the large scale of their\u00a0operations and their importance both nationally and internationally.<\/p><p>Provision of funding is contingent on establishments being in compliance with the zoo licensing\u00a0standards\u00a0as set out by the Zoo Regulations and the Irish Standards of Modern Zoo Practice.<\/p><p>Virtual inspections are being carried out by my Department at the moment\u00a0and I understand that these should be concluded next week.

In Conclusions adopted at the same time as the Action Plan, the Council made clear that respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights will continue to underpin all areas of EU external action, including in relation to trade.<\/p>  <p>  Achieving the objectives of the Action Plan will require the systematic and coordinated use of the full range of instruments at the EU&rsquo;s disposal, including political, human rights and sectoral policy dialogues with third countries and regional organisations; the development of human rights and democracy country strategies; actions in multilateral and regional human rights fora; election missions and their follow-up; regular dialogue with civil society, human rights defenders, national human rights institutions, the business sector and other relevant stakeholders; and restrictive measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan includes specific commitments to strengthen the implementation of human rights provisions in EU trade policy, including through the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), and by promoting labour rights in the context of Free Trade Agreements.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan also contains a wide-ranging series of commitments to promote implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment\u00a0has responsibility for trade policy, and for the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s trade interests at EU\u00a0trade policy negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800074#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":731,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800074#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":732,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[41140\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800074#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the actions Ireland is taking in relation to the ongoing crisis in Belarus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The repression of the Belarusian people and the denial of their democratic rights is unacceptable. We have seen mass and indiscriminate detentions of adults and minors, curtailments of fundamental freedoms, media freedoms and internet shutdowns, and credible reports of torture, ill-treatment and sexual violence against detainees. Ireland has repeatedly called for the repression to end and we have condemned the ongoing use of State violence against peaceful protesters, which recently led to the death of Raman Bandarenka in police custody.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supported the imposition of EU sanctions against 55 key figures of the Belarusian administration who were responsible for the fraudulent Presidential election in August and the violence we have seen. The latest tranche of sanctions included Alexander Lukashenko and his son Viktor, and along with our EU partners, we stand ready to take further measures. We also strongly support the EU in re-directing EU funds towards Belarusian civil society and away from the authorities. Complementing these efforts, Ireland has contributed funds to projects in Belarus managed by the European Endowment for Democracy that seek to protect fundamental human rights and media freedoms in the country.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We have repeatedly expressed our deep concerns about the appalling state of human rights in Belarus in international settings, including most recently at the Human Rights Council (HRC) on 4 December. We have called on the Belarusian authorities to implement the recommendations of the OSCE Rapporteur's Moscow Mechanism Report and the recommendations made by the international community during the recent Universal Periodic Review cycle at the HRC. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also shares\u00a0the concerns of UN Special Rapporteur Lawlor on the persecution of women human rights defenders and we are deeply troubled by the prosecutions of Maria Rabkova, Irina Sukhiy and Marina Dubina.

This is shared by the SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and which led the decision not to run the state examinations this summer.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the return to schools of students for the 2020\/21 academic year my Department published a range of documentation and support material as part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School, which is available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. That schools have remained open throughout level 5 restrictions has been very encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  Specific guidance was provided to post-primary schools in the Returning to School: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post-primary school leaders and teachers. In the guidance on in-school assessment advised that:<\/p>  <p>  It is, however, important that over-assessment is avoided and that an appropriate balance is achieved between formative and summative assessment. The provision of timely feedback to students will be particularly important in this school year given the context where, during the school closure period, the opportunities for and quality of feedback to students on their work varied from school to school and sometimes from subject to subject.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment of students&rsquo; learning should reflect the aims and learning outcomes of specifications, priority learning units and syllabuses as relevant, ensuring accessibility to the mode of assessment for all students. In planning for assessment, the use of self- assessment by learners of their own progress, as well as peer assessment could be usefully included as a strategy to support assessment activities.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.<\/p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019\/20 and may occur in 2020\/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  Further clarification on the assessment arrangements for 2021 for certain subjects will issue shortly. <\/p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations is significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.\u00a0 The measures relating to COVID-19 that have been put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The SEC has commenced its contingency planning for the 2021 examinations, recognising that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19. \u00a0It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects have issued earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.\u00a0 These changes to the Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 are deigned to provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November in an online meeting to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the NCCA and the Department, including the National Educational Psychological Service. Representatives from the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are also represented on the advisory group to ensure liaison with the third level sector.<\/p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers.

That schools have remained open throughout level 5 restrictions has been very encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.<\/p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019\/20 and may occur in 2020\/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  Further clarification on the assessment arrangements for 2021 for certain subjects will issue shortly. <\/p>  <p>  It is my firm intention\u00a0to operate the conventional 2021 state examinations, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. This is shared by the SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations<\/p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations is significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.\u00a0 The measures relating to COVID-19 that have been put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The SEC has commenced its contingency planning for the 2021 examinations, recognising that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19. \u00a0It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects have issued earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.\u00a0 These changes to the Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 are deigned to provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November in an online meeting to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the NCCA and the Department, including the National Educational Psychological Service. Representatives from the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are also represented on the advisory group to ensure liaison with the third level sector.<\/p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers.

The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. <\/p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty.\u00a0It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty trap.<\/p>  <p>  The NCS includes two types of financial subsidies towards the cost of quality childcare:<\/p>  <p>  - A universal subsidy payable for children aged between 24 weeks and 36 months who are availing of childcare from an approved childcare provider. The subsidy rate is &euro;0.50 per hour and covers a maximum of up to 45 hours per week. It&rsquo;s payable for children older than 36 months who do not yet qualify for the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families at any income level. <\/p>  <p>  - An income-related subsidy payable for children aged from 24 weeks to 15 years who are availing of childcare from an approved childcare provider. The level of subsidy paid for the child is determined by the family&rsquo;s reckonable income (gross income minus tax, other deductibles and any applicable multiple children discount). The reckonable income must be between &euro;26,000 and &euro;60,000. The enhanced hours available are up to a maximum of 45 hours per week and the standard hours available are up to a maximum of 20 hours per week. The NCS acknowledges that childcare needs differ widely across families, offering subsidies at an hourly rate allowing for flexible childcare arrangements to be made based on parental needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the NCS higher subsidies are awarded to families with younger children, to reflect the higher cost of providing childcare for younger children because of the higher adult-child ratios required by the Early Years Regulations. Subsidies taper downwards from a maximum of &euro;5.10 per hour for children between 6 months and 1 year, to a maximum of &euro;3.75 for school aged children. The number of hours a child is eligible for depends on whether the parent is engaged in work, training or study. <\/p>  <p>  Please note that in the examples provided by the Deputy\u00a0insufficient particulars were supplied, including the child&rsquo;s age\/education stage, the net income of the family and the hours of childcare required.These criteria affect the level of subsidy that can be allocated to an applicant. The assumptions required to finalise an estimate are noted in the examples below.<\/p>  <p>  Where the Deputy notes &ldquo;person&rdquo;, we assume this to mean &ldquo;household&rdquo; where all assessable individuals are in work or study. That is we assume the noted income is for the entire household.<\/p>  <p>  There are also many variables in the calculation of net income. We have estimated a net income to enable the calculations as noted below.<\/p>  <p>  Example 1: In the case of a household with\u00a0one child aged\u00a02\u00a0and with household earnings of approx. &euro;30,000 gross (assume &euro;27,000 net), the\u00a0applicant would receive a weekly subsidy of &euro;190 for 45 hours childcare per week.<\/p>  <p>  Example 2: In the case of a\u00a0household with earnings of &euro;30,000 gross (assume &euro;27,000 net) with\u00a0two children - a 7 year old (in first class) and an 11 month old, the applicant would receive a weekly subsidy of &euro;297 during term and time and &euro;398 out of term for 45 hours childcare.<\/p>  <p>  Example 3: In the case of a\u00a0household with earnings of &euro;40,000 gross (assume &euro;34,000 net) with a 3 year old and 5 year old child, the applicant would receive a weekly subsidy of &euro;195 during term time and &euro;327 out of term for 45 hours childcare. To note the family would receive an additional 15 hours free childcare per week during term time whilst the 3 year old was in the ECCE scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Example 4: In the case of a household\u00a0on a wage of 80,000 gross (&euro;57,000 net)\u00a0with three children -\u00a0a child aged 10 (in fifth class), a\u00a07 year old (in first class) and\u00a0a 2 year old, the applicant\u00a0would receive a weekly subsidy of &euro;134 during term time and &euro;197 out of term time for 45 hours childcare per week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":1129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1130,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[41238\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will report on the friends of the centre aspect of the new proposed direct provision centre in Letterkenny, County Donegal; the other centres and counties that have friends of the centre structures; the organisations involved in such structures; the decision-making process; the person or body to which the groups are accountable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1131,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[41239\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the feedback and complaints mechanisms that will be available to the new residents of the proposed direct provision centre in Letterkenny, County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1132,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[41240\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if there will be staff trained specifically in dealing with trauma, integration and other well-being areas in the new proposed direct provision centre in Letterkenny, County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1133,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[41241\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the timeframe for move-ins he is expecting for the new proposed direct provision centre in Letterkenny, County Donegal; the consultation he is taking with Government colleagues on ensuring that all necessary infrastructural issues are resolved in Letterkenny in the coming month; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1134,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444 to 447, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  An accommodation centre for families in the International Protection process will open on Port Road in Letterkenny in early 2021. It is expected that residents will move into the centre on a phased basis over a period of 8 to 10 weeks thereafter. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While their application is being examined, all applicants for International Protection are offered free of charge: accommodation, meals or food supplies\u00a0(where self-catering is available) and personal care products.\u00a0 Other supports such as healthcare, education for children and classes for adults, and a weekly payment for personal expenditure are provided through the relevant\u00a0State services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As part of the establishment of any such accommodation centre my Department, through the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS), develops close working relationships with all state and local agencies including the Departments of Social Protection and Education and the HSE.\u00a0 This ensures that the whole of Government service envisioned by the system is delivered directly to all residents in all accommodation services by the relevant government department or State agency. <\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department has already engaged with state service providers in preparation for the arrival of residents to the Port Road Accommodation Centre and will continue to liaise with them as necessary for as long as the centre remains in operation. Officials from my Department have also met with the Letterkenny Municipal Council to brief councillors on the planned opening and will continue to engage and update Council members in coming weeks and months. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I can also assure the Deputy that the ongoing welfare needs of International Protection applicants is of upmost importance to my Department and is taken into consideration during the procurement process for accommodation centres. Potential contractors are required to propose an implementation plan to provide for the welfare needs of residents. This plan must provide details regarding the experience and qualifications of staff in providing social care in a residential facility, ideally in a multicultural environment. \u00a0Particular consideration is given to the qualifications or experience of staff in dealing with vulnerable people and people suffering from the effects of trauma.<\/p>  <p>  The Port Road Accommodation Centre in Letterkenny\u00a0will be\u00a0operated by Bridgestock Care which has extensive experience of\u00a0providing services to protection applicants (asylum seekers) and refugees in social care settings across multiple locations\u00a0both in Ireland and abroad. The team of people available to Bridgestock Care\u00a0for the centre in\u00a0Letterkenny is highly qualified and very experienced in providing social care in multicultural environments. <\/p>  <p>  The IPAS has also recently engaged Barnardos to provide training to all centres and emergency accommodation locations, on 'Understanding Child Development through a Trauma Informed Lens'. This training will assist with ensuring centre staff and managers are aware of the impact of trauma on children and understand how that may inform the behaviour of any child or indeed adult who has been impacted by trauma.<\/p>  <p>  The IPAS has a complaints procedure which is set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection applicants. \u00a0Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution. \u00a0If the person concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, he or she may make a complaint to IPAS who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate. \u00a0In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how his or her complaint is dealt with, he or she has full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a\u00a0confidential Freephone telephone support service, funded by, but independent of, my Department, was also established in May 2020 to provide further support to residents that are being accommodated by my Department. This Freephone confidential support helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS).\u00a0 Any complaint made through this service may be passed in confidence to IPAS for investigation and resolution. <\/p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that all centre operators are contractually bound to facilitate the establishment of\u00a0a &lsquo;Friends of the Centre&rsquo; group and must make a room available to facilitate meetings. \u00a0The operation of the &lsquo;Friends of the Centre&rsquo; group is facilitated by staff from the accommodation centre. <\/p>  <p>  The composition of each group varies from centre to centre but will include residents, staff members and volunteers from the local community. Officials from the IPAS will occasionally attend meetings if invited by the group to do so. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the group is to help establish links between the residents of accommodation centres and local community, voluntary and sporting groups which promotes integration across the community and assists residents to\u00a0have meaningful interaction with the local community. They are a valuable support to residents and to centre managers and staff.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The groups promote relationships between the centre and the local community and local clubs so residents may take part in a variety of activities outside the centre, in the community, to assist with their integration. \u00a0There is no decision making responsibility in respect of residents associated with the groups.<\/p>  <p>  The scope of and the types of activities engaged in by the group vary from centre to centre. They reflect the type of residents being accommodated in a centre and also the voluntary groups that are active in a particular locality. For example, the activities engaged in by a group based in a centre that accommodates only single adults will be different to those engaged in by a group based on a centre accommodating families. Examples of groups that have engaged with Friends of the Centre include local Tidy Towns committees, sports clubs, Men's Sheds and Mother and Baby clubs.\u00a0 Groups providing for activities, in the centres or externally, with the aim of integrating residents of the centres into the community are eligible to apply for funding under the Communities Integration Fund (CIF).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The new Centre in Letterkenny will also have an Activities Co-Ordinator to assist residents this through a range of different initiatives including but not limited to:<\/p>  <p>  - A comprehensive Induction Seminar for all residents the day after arrival that includes information and briefing on all integration initiatives at the Centre<\/p>  <p>  - English classes provided by the Education Training Board <\/p>  <p>  - Attendance by the Activites Co-Ordinator (by agreement) with parents at parent\/teacher meetings at local schools particularly in cases where they may be language difficulties<\/p>  <p>  - Ongoing support and guidance\u00a0from the management team in helping residents who obtain a permission to reside in the State to find suitable accommodation in the community and integrate into society once they leave the centre.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the &lsquo;Friends of the Centre&rsquo; group will be facilitated by the Activities Co-Ordinator and other staff from the accommodation centre. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that\u00a0a number of local groups in Letterkenny have already made contact with\u00a0my Department to offer their support and assistance to the families when they arrive.\u00a0 I envisage that the Friends of the Centre Group for the\u00a0Port Road Accommodation Centre will develop into a thriving and productive forum linking the centre with the local community, ensuring the local community have an opportunity to become an active part of the Centre as well as facilitating local engagement with the residents of the Centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":1135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1136,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[41304\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800081#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the Blue Skies initiative will be rolled out to the high growth area of Saggart, Rathcoole, Newcastle County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1137,"content":"<p>The Tusla\u00a0ABC Programme within Tusla's Partnership Participation and Family Support is an area based Prevention and Early Intervention initiative currently being delivered across 12 sites of urban disadvantage, including one in Clondalkin where the Blue Skies programme is situated.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions continue to take place across the ABC programme to explore the potential scaling of the learnings from the programme, and broadening its reach, taking into consideration identified need, resources available and scope of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla Dublin South Central is aware of the increasing needs and population growth of the Saggart\/Rathcoole \/Newcastle areas and is working with partner agencies to ensure provision of early interventions services to families and children.

Priority groups include those studying in disciplines that are dependent on in-person small group learning as is the case for ELE and as restrictions ease there is an expectation that there should be greater opportunity to provide increasing levels of small group learning. <\/p>  <p>  They also acknowledge that education providers will make their own plans for how they move forward based on their own context specific assessments and will communicate them with their students, learners and staff.\u00a0 Within the plans, the health and safety of students, learners and staff must always come first, with an understanding that they will need to adapt as the situation changes, in line with the public health advice. Every effort must continue to facilitate social distancing and limit congregation, adhering closely to the guidance to safeguard the health and safety of everyone.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the nature and demands of quality English language education, the need to meet the pedagogical requirements of its students, alongside recognising the serious challenges that have arisen within this sector as it transitioned to online delivery, ELE providers should in Level 3 commence the process of providing English language education in-person and in classroom based settings where it can take place safely and in small groups. This is consistent with the approach being adopted in further and higher education. <\/p>  <p>  English language education provided on that basis should, therefore, be regarded as encompassed within the priority groups highlighted by the Minister that are dependent on in-person small group learning. However, classroom based provision is only possible once it is safe to do so and is in line with public health guidelines. <\/p>  <p>Consequently, ELE providers are requested to examine and assess their individual arrangements to provide classroom based learning for small groups in a safe manner. However, it is acknowledged that while some providers, based on their assessments, will decide that it is safe to return to in-person classroom learning, other providers may consider it necessary to develop a structured plan, implementing online or blended learning solutions during this period of Level 3 restrictions, building towards increasing levels of in-person small group learning over time. If such a plan is necessary, it should be notified to the Department of Justice prior to 7 January 2021. <\/p>  <p>  It is a priority for this sector to urgently develop and put in place the sector specific guidance and protocols required to ensure that in person English language education, safeguards learners, staff and the communities in which providers are located.\u00a0 Pending the finalisation and implementation of these protocols it is obviously essential that ELE providers continue to strictly comply with the HSA Return to Work Protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800082#WRY01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology","counter":1179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800082#WRY01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1180,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[41165\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800082#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to fractured industrial relations in Waterford Institute of Technology that are resulting in a large number of cases in the WRC and courts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1181,"content":"<p>Employees, in Higher Education Institutions, have a number of industrial relation mechanisms available to them to address queries on employment matters, with either their employer or their union representatives. <\/p><p>If unions wish\u00a0to raise issues, there are also structures within which they can do so, which include Fora for unions representing a wide range of staff. <\/p><p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) promotes the maintenance of good\u00a0 workplace relations and all parties are free to access this service, so as to ensure the compliance of the relevant employment laws.\u00a0 My department supports the work of the WRC in bringing the relevant parties together to seek resolutions on industrial relations matters and encourages the parties to use the available mechanisms that promotes the improvement of industrial relations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800082#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[41166\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800082#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount spent over the past four years by Waterford Institute of Technology or on behalf of the Institute or Department on legal fees, awards and settlements associated with staff grievances and lawsuits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1184,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[41167\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800082#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount spent over the past four years by Waterford Institute of Technology or on its behalf on consultants for improving industrial relations and increases in insurance premiums; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1185,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 464 and 465 together.<\/p>  <p>My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions.

Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.<\/p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.\u00a0 It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that CAB published its Strategic Plan for 2020 to 2023 in July of this year.\u00a0 The strategic plan describes the structure of CAB and its key programmes of activity to deliver its remit. CAB has trained a nationwide network of asset profilers to identify assets acquired from the proceeds of criminal conduct. The Bureau continues to develop specialist expertise and technology to trace and investigate these assets. It also continues to work closely with international crime investigation agencies, and has successfully targeted proceeds of foreign criminality from countries such as the US and the UK.<\/p><p>The Criminal Assets Bureau normally conducts training courses for asset profilers twice per year.\u00a0 For the most part asset profilers are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from local divisions and from special units.\u00a0 In addition, a small number have been trained from the\u00a0Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>During 2019, the Criminal Assets Bureau provided Divisional Asset Profiler Training for 100 personnel.

However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.\u00a0 In some instances, completing the necessary checks, including security checks\u00a0can take a considerable period of time with the\u00a0result in\u00a0some applications taking longer than the average timescale. <\/p><p>At the end of October there were 23,187 applications being processed at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received by the Citizenship Division to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony. <\/p><p>It is very likely that a significant proportion of these applications would have progressed to completion during 2020 if it had been possible for citizenship ceremonies to go ahead. \u00a0It should be noted that the Citizenship Division did not suspend the receipt or processing of applications at any stage during COVID-19 restrictions, although processing rates have been negatively impacted by health and safety related restrictions.<\/p><p>The breakdown of applications by length of time open is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Length of time open<\/th>       <th>No. of applications<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt; 6 months<\/td>       <td>4,625<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>6 -12 months<\/td>       <td>5,304<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12 - 18 months<\/td>       <td>4,677<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>18 - 24 months<\/td>       <td>3,202<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 24 months<\/td>       <td>5,379<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>23,187<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Processing timescales\u00a0can be\u00a0impacted by\u00a0incomplete applications having to be returned;\u00a0further documentation being required from the applicant; where\u00a0the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service of my Department. In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues\u00a0can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is\u00a0required\u00a0to be considered before a final decision is taken.<\/p><p>Additionally a\u00a0number of\u00a0issues have impacted on the\u00a0processing of citizenship applications\u00a0over the past 12 months.\u00a0 A\u00a0High Court case which was\u00a0subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal\u00a0resulted in significant delays last year. This has been compounded by the COVID-19 restrictions\u00a0which have impacted\u00a0the delivery of normal services to date this year. The combined impact of the Jones judgement and the COVID-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months processing time. \u00a0As a result, the\u00a0processing timeline for standard applications has increased to 12 months.<\/p><p>I recently\u00a0announced that citizenship ceremonies will be temporarily replaced, \u00a0while COVID-19 restrictions are in place, \u00a0with a requirement for citizenship applicants to sign an affidavit declaring loyalty to the State.\u00a0Work is at an advanced stage in my Department on the preparation of the necessary regulations under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 to make provision for this.\u00a0It is intended that the regulations will be finalised very early in 2021 and information on the new\u00a0requirements will be posted on the Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) website at that time. <\/p><p>In addition, work is well advanced on the following suite of measures designed to deal with the current unprecedented level of demand: <\/p><p>Additional staffing is being assigned to the Citizenship Division and is expected to be in place by year&rsquo;s end. Attendant to this development, restructuring of the organisational structure of the Division is currently underway to ensure optimal customer service delivery.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Citizenship website has been significantly revisited with a view to increasing clarity and enhancing the customer\u00a0. As part of this process, a new online chat conversation application, or &ldquo;Chatbot&rdquo; has just been introduced called Tara. This\u00a0is providing users with an instant response to frequently asked questions and will mimic real-time text or message exchange with a member of staff.\u00a0<\/p><p>Plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are well advanced, in line with my recent announcement to significantly modernise the Justice Sector through increased digital and ICT investment. As part of this process, on-line payments have been trialled for applications from minors and the process is currently being rolled out to adult applications on a phased basis.<\/p><p>Citizenship\u00a0Division will also be moving from a paper based transaction model currently utilised with the Garda National Vetting Bureau to a digital platform. It is anticipated that this will substantially cut application processing times once it is fully operational.<\/p><p>The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up additional resources to focus on enhanced customer service delivery, ensuring the integrity of the process is protected and processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, \u00a0in order to improve service to our customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800085#WRBB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge","counter":1366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800085#WRBB02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1367,"qnumday":529,"qnumall":"[42053\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800085#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"cad iad na c&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; &aacute; nglacadh aici le cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh Gaeilge ag na breithi&uacute;na ar fad a cheapfar le freastal ar na C&uacute;irteanna D&uacute;iche agus na C&uacute;irteanna Cuarda sna ceantair ar fad a bhfuil Gaeltacht iontu, mar at&aacute; leagtha amach san Acht C&uacute;irteanna Breithi&uacute;nais, 1924; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1575","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1368,"content":"<p>Is mian liom a chur in i&uacute;l don Teachta go bhfor&aacute;iltear mar a leanas in alt 44 den Acht C&uacute;irteanna Breithi&uacute;nais, 1924 (Uimh. 10 de 1924):<\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Sa mh&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; agus gach n&iacute; a bhaineann leis an sc&eacute;al d&rsquo;&aacute;ireamh, beidh ag an mBreitheamh Cuarda, a ceapfar d&rsquo;aon Chuaird ina bhfuil an Ghaedhilg in &uacute;s&aacute;id ghener&aacute;lta, oiread eolais ar an nGaedhilg agus chuirfadh ar a chumas d&eacute;anamh in &eacute;amais conganta o fhear teangan agus fianaise &aacute; tabhairt sa teangain sin.&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; for&aacute;il den tsamhail sin maidir le Breithi&uacute;na den Ch&uacute;irt D&uacute;iche in alt 71 d&rsquo;Acht sin 1924, chomh maith:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Sa mh&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; agus gach n&iacute; a bhaineann leis an sc&eacute;al d&rsquo;&aacute;ireamh, beidh ag an mBreitheamh den Ch&uacute;irt D&uacute;ithche, a ceapfar do Dh&uacute;thaigh ina bhfuil l&iacute;omat&aacute;iste ina bhfuil an Ghaedhilg in &uacute;s&aacute;id ghener&aacute;lta, oiread eolais ar an nGaedhilg agus chuirfadh ar a chumas d&eacute;anamh in &eacute;amais conganta o fhear teangan agus fianaise &aacute; tabhairt sa teangain sin.&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  Faoi alt 16(1) d&rsquo;Acht na gC&uacute;irteanna agus na nOifigeach C&uacute;irte, 1995, t&aacute; ar dhaoine ar mian leo go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; iad a mheas chun a gceaptha chuig oifig bhreithi&uacute;nachta &eacute; sin a chur in i&uacute;l, i scr&iacute;bhinn, don Bhord Comhairleach um Cheapach&aacute;in Bhreithi&uacute;na, tr&iacute; fhoirm iarratais don Ch&uacute;irt iomchu&iacute; a l&iacute;onadh isteach.

This report is submitted to the National Disability Authority (NDA).<\/p><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s 2018 report indicated that 146 out of 2488 employees, or 5.9%, reported having a disability. The 2019 report indicated that 144 out of 2676 employees, or 5.4%, reported having a disability. This exceeds the current 3% target of employment of persons with disabilities set in the Disability Act 2005. Officials in my Department are currently preparing the 2020 return.<\/p><p>Considerable work is undertaken within my Department to retain staff with disabilities and to improve the quality of their experience within the work environment. Efforts across a range of areas such as role adjustments, redeployment in some cases, additional and specific training, physical work space adjustments and use of assistive technologies have enabled staff within my Department who have a disability to perform effectively in their role and make a meaningful contribution to the work of the organisation. <\/p><p>My Department follows the Civil Service Code of Practice on the employment of people with disabilities. My Department&rsquo;s Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) is available to assist and support staff with disabilities, in confidence, and their line managers by providing information, guidance, and support, as well as assisting in the provision of reasonable accommodations. My Department will roll out Disability and Autism Awareness training to all staff next year in line with the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2121. \u00a0<\/p><p>At induction, new entrants are advised in relation to the role of the DLO and how the Department works to facilitate staff with disabilities. If additional training is required to facilitate an individual to meet the job requirements, the Corporate Learning Unit will source the training. My Department has purchased additional assistive technologies, which allow greater access to training and courses conducted within the organisation.\u00a0All invitations to attend courses specifically ask participants to identify any special requirements.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department takes part in the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme every year. WAM is an initiative of the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD), which offers a six-month paid mentored work experience placement to graduates with disabilities. My Department also participates in the Job Shadow Day initiative, which brings people with disabilities and local employers together for one day in the workplace. <\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question regarding the number or percentage\u00a0of staff in my Department, this information is provided in tabular format below. <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Justice<\/td>       <td>5.9%<\/td>       <td>5.4%<\/td>       <td>N\/a*<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na** <\/td>       <td>3%<\/td>       <td>3%<\/td>       <td>3%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Courts\u00a0 Service<\/td>       <td>3.2%<\/td>       <td>3.2%<\/td>       <td>3.3%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Judicial\u00a0Council<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Services Regulatory Authority<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>3.7%<\/td>       <td>2.6%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Aid Board<\/td>       <td>18 staff<\/td>       <td>7 staff<\/td>       <td>12 staff<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>* Currently preparing the 2020 return \u00a0<\/p><p>** This figure is an estimation from returns of the Staff Census form, which all Garda Staff employees are furnished with when they are commencing employment within An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.

The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018.

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus.\u00a0The Plan is framed to account for periods during\u00a0which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a\u00a0high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.\u00a0Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time.

The Committee also heard from Consultants involved in the specialist management of patients with hATTR amyloidosis.<\/p>  <p>  The RDTRC continued its review of Patisiran at its subsequent meeting on 5 November which included patient input on the impact of hATTR amyloidosis.<\/p>  <p>  The RDTRC finalised a statement summarising the clinician and patient engagement on Patisiran which was forwarded to the HSE Drugs Group the week ending 27 November.\u00a0The HSE has advised that the\u00a0 Drugs Group is expected to consider Patisiran again to include the output of the Committee early in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The application for Patisiran remains under consideration with the HSE and is being assessed in line with the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800091#WRHH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":1680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800091#WRHH01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1681,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[41519\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800091#WRHH01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider removing the valid to expiry date on medical cards for citizens aged 70 years or older and allowing these to be held without need for renewal;

CHI at Crumlin have recommenced the majority of outpatient and diagnostic services, albeit at reduced numbers, due to public health guidelines on social distancing.  Currently, Consultant Rheumatologists are seeing a number of patients in the outpatient suite including urgent patients and those who were deferred during the early phases of COVID-19.  <\/p><p>CHI has further advised that there is an active recruitment campaign for an additional Rheumatology Consultant underway. This addition to the medical staff will allow for an increased number of patients to be seen, diagnosed and treatment initiated, as part of the comprehensive Rheumatology service.<\/p><p>In relation to the provision of MRI services, the demand for specialist imaging has increased over recent years due to increased activity and acuity in CHI, as well as an increasing trend to utilise imaging in diagnosis and treatment.  CHI have advised that, uniquely to Paediatrics, younger children and children up to 18 years old with complex needs may be unable to remain still in an MRI for the lengthy periods required to complete the scan, resulting in the requirement for a General Anaesthetic (GA) to be delivered by a Paediatric Anaesthesiologist.  This limits the ability for these scans to be performed outside of CHI hospitals. CHI have confirmed to my Department that each request for an MRI scan is carefully examined by Consultant Radiologists who must prioritise, based on clinical urgency, each case in terms of access to the scanner.  <\/p><p>CHI has advised that patients with Down Syndrome who present to Rheumatology services with suspicion of arthritis are clinically assessed and diagnosed by the clinical team. A cohort of these patients will require an MRI scan based on the individualised clinical examination and recommendation.  <\/p><p>With regard to waiting lists for MRI, the HSE advises that a pilot project commenced in 2016 by the HSE Acute Hospitals Division to progress the collection of national radiology waiting list data.  The data is reported quarterly, and the attached table shows the waiting list by time band at CHI at the end of Quarter 3, 2020. Due to the nature of this data the HSE have advised that it is not possible to determine the proportion of the waiting list associated with specific specialties such as Rheumatology diagnosis or treatment.<\/p><p>In relation to waiting lists for Rheumatology Outpatient appointments and Inpatient and Day Case procedures the tables attached show the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) published figures at the end of October 2020. NTPF waiting lists are collected in respect of outpatient specialties and inpatient\/daycase procedures. Waiting times can be examined in terms of the appointment or procedure that a patient is waiting for, however it is not possible to identify patients based on their clinical diagnosis. <\/p><p><b>Quarter 3 2020 waiting list for MRI at Children's Health Ireland<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>0-3 mths<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>3-6 mths<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>6-9 mths<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>9-12 mths<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>12-15 mths<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>15-18 mths<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>18+ mths<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Total<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>886<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>487<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>507<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>400<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>290<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>255<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>504<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>3329<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800093#WRKK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1795,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800093#WRKK02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1796,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[41854\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800093#WRKK02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns regarding the availability of paediatric rheumatologists here with the current waiting list being three years; if his attention has been further drawn to the particular concern for children with Down syndrome associated arthritis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1797,"content":"<p>I sincerely regret that children can experience a long waiting time for Rheumatology treatment, and I am conscious of the burden that this places on them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) has advised my Department that during the initial phases of COVID-19, all face to face hospital outpatient reviews and most of the planned diagnostic tests, including MRI, were deferred in response to the pandemic.\u00a0CHI at Crumlin have recommenced the majority of outpatient and diagnostic services, albeit at reduced numbers, due to public health guidelines on social distancing.\u00a0 Currently, Consultant Rheumatologists are seeing a number of patients in the outpatient suite including urgent patients and those who were deferred during the early phases of COVID-19.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  CHI has further advised that there is an active recruitment campaign for an additional Rheumatology Consultant underway.

The General Scheme was approved by the Government and has been referred to the Oireachtas Committee on Health for pre-legislative scrutiny.

These Regulations prohibit advertisements for e-cigarettes online and in printed publications except for those directed at persons in the e-cigarette industry. In addition, advertisements for e-cigarettes are prohibited on television, on-demand television services and on radio. Finally, any form of contribution to an event, activity or person with the aim of promoting e-cigarettes and with a cross-border effect is also prohibited. The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to curb the advertising of nicotine-inhaling products near schools, on public transport and in cinemas.<\/p>  <p>  The protection of children is at the heart of Tobacco Free Ireland, Ireland&rsquo;s current tobacco control policy. Measures including the workplace smoking ban in 2004 which brought an end to smoking in restaurants and cafes, prohibitions on the advertising of tobacco products at the point of sale and the introduction of plain packaging, have greatly reduced young people&rsquo;s exposure to tobacco products. Local initiatives, such as Not Around Us in Limerick that promote smoke free environments have sought to further reduce the areas where smoking and vaping are present in daily public life. At a national level, the HSE adopted a Tobacco Free Campus policy for its facilities in 2012, and that was extended to electronic cigarettes in 2014. Under the Tobacco Free Ireland Programme the HSE has held discussions with several Irish universities and colleges a number of which have introduced similar policies for their own campuses. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent data on smoking among young people in Ireland is from the European Schools Project on Alcohol and other Drugs 2019 Ireland report.

Separately, the Health Behaviour in School Age Children Study 2018 found that the number of 12-17 year olds who reported having tried smoking dropped by 5%, from 16% in 2014 to 11% in 2018. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800096#WROO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Screening Programmes","counter":1964,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800096#WROO04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1965,"qnumday":780,"qnumall":"[42087\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800096#WROO04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the research that has been done into a lung cancer screening programme in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1966,"content":"<p>Lung cancer screening is receiving increasing attention worldwide, both with\u00a0medical professionals and the general public.

It is hoped that the targeted lung cancer awareness campaigns referenced above will result in more cancer's being detected earlier, leading to better outcomes for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800097#WRPP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1983,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 788 and 789 answered with Question No. 538.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1984,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800097#WRPP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1985,"qnumday":790,"qnumall":"[42125\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800097#WRPP01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if clinical guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK, which states that women who are 28 weeks pregnant and beyond are at increased risk of becoming severely ill should they contract Covid-19, has been considered in line with the HSE's policy with regard to risks that Covid-19 poses to women; and if health and safety leave will be granted in the event that a pregnant woman's doctor recommends going on leave due to a heightened risk of falling severely ill (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.

No 62 of 2016)(as amended).<\/p><p>Proper identification is comprised of four\u00a0elements, all of which must be in place within twelve\u00a0months of the date of birth of the animal. These comprise:<\/p> <blockquote> \t- a single lifetime identification document (passport)\u00a0\u00a0containing a unique lifetime identification number (UELN) in respect of\u00a0the animal, issued by an approved Passport Issuing Organisation (PIO); <br \/><br \/>- all equines issued with a passport since 1<sup>st<\/sup>July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip inserted, by a practicing\u00a0veterinary surgeon, the unique number of which is recorded on the corresponding passport to ensure an unequivocal link between the animal and the identification document;<br \/><br \/>- a database recording of specific identification data\u00a0in the database of the PIO that issued the passport; and <br \/><br \/>- a database entry in the central equine database of the country where the issuing PIO is approved. <\/blockquote>  <p>In addition, persons in charge of any premises in which equines are kept are required to register their premises with my Department and to maintain records to assist the Department in tracing horses,\u00a0should a disease outbreak occur. Furthermore, as part of the identification process for equines resident in Ireland, an owner\/keeper who applies to have their horse identified is requested to provide the premises registration number of the holding where the animal will be normally resident to the issuing PIO.<\/p><p>The Equidae (Transfer of Ownership) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No 201 of 2016) governs the transfer of ownership of equine animals and requires that transfer of ownership details be notified to the relevant PIO and the central database within 30 days of date of transfer.<\/p><p>My Department\u00a0continues to dedicate a substantial level of resources and funding to animal welfare. In December 2019, the largest ever\u00a0allocation of funding from my Department of &euro;2.906m to 106 animal welfare organisations was announced.\u00a0\u00a0A number of\u00a0other organisations undertake work with equines. I\u00a0will make an announcement of funding for 2020 shortly.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Programme for Government also contains commitments to provide additional urban horse welfare programmes. My Department continues to take a proactive approach in tackling challenges by developing facilities for\u00a0urban and Traveller horse populations and in educating young people among these communities in the care and welfare of horses. This work is\u00a0carried out\u00a0in close collaboration with the local authorities, and will be reflected in the new Animal Welfare Strategy which I will launch shortly.<\/p><p>My\u00a0Department continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to disadvantaged areas.\u00a0As an example,\u00a0the\u00a0DSPCA with financial assistance from my Department,\u00a0continues to\u00a0facilitate castration and ID clinics and education programmes in an effort to address\u00a0the problem of over-breeding which can add to\u00a0welfare issues.<\/p><p>The Control of Horses Act, 1996 is currently under review within my Department and plans for replacement legislation are well advanced.\u00a0 My Department will be further engaging on this with stakeholders at an early date. Under the Act,\u00a0local authorities may take a range of actions in relation to equines including prohibiting horses in certain areas, the issuing of licences, the seizure of horses in contravention of the Act.\u00a0 These powers can be used in respect of\u00a0straying horses which includes horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission, including public land.\u00a0 The local authorities may also prosecute offenders under the\u00a0Control of Horses Act.\u00a0 While still at an unacceptable level, the overall numbers of equines seized have been falling year-on-year from a high of approximately 5,000 in 2014 to less than 900 in 2019.<\/p><p>My Department continues to support other agencies and local authorities in the enforcement of horse welfare related matters.<\/p><p>The Deputy may\u00a0be aware\u00a0that my Department operates a confidential\u00a0animal welfare helpline through which members of the public can report incidents of animal cruelty or neglect for investigation. If the Deputy wishes to pass on\u00a0details of any\u00a0cases of alleged neglect or cruelty that she is aware of, they will be fully investigated by my\u00a0Department and appropriate actions, up to and including prosecution, may be taken.<\/p><p>The dedicated e-mail address and Helpline\u00a0in place for reporting suspected cases of animal welfare are:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHelpline Phone No. Call Save - 0761 064408, phone - 01 607 2379 and the email address -<i>animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie<\/i>. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800097#WRPP05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":2021,"qnumday":802,"qnumall":"[41259\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800097#WRPP05400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps that have been taken in conjunction with local authorities to ensure that the licensing and welfare of horses is taken seriously, especially in built-up areas.

This is compared to only five\u00a0stocks in 2009. This is clear evidence of progress through the CFP and the shared aim of sustainable fishing.<\/p>  <p>  The report implies that Ireland deliberately sought to have TACs set in excess of the scientific advice and attempted to\u00a0ignore or downplay the specific circumstances of each stock. These findings do not reflect the complexity of fisheries management and the TAC-setting mechanisms and the relationship to scientific advice.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s goals for sustainable fisheries are supported through the CFP. The CFP provides the framework for the long-term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission makes proposals each year for TAC levels for each stock, these are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks. It also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice. The TAC&rsquo;s are adopted by the EU Council which involves all Member States and the European Commission,\u00a0not just Ireland. The vast majority of stocks in which Ireland has an interest are shared with other Member States and each has their own views and concerns.<\/p>  <p>  At last year&rsquo;s December Council, TACs and quotas were agreed for 47 stocks of interest to Ireland. For 32 target stocks, the\u00a0TACs for 2020 were set at or below the scientific advice where available, meeting MSY criteria. For four\u00a0vulnerable stocks of interest to Ireland, where the advice was for no fishing, restrictive TACs and quotas were set. This allows for unavoidable by-catches of these stocks, in circumstances where they are part of mixed fisheries. The Council also agreed to very small TACs and quotas to allow for the collection of scientific data for three\u00a0depleted herring stocks. For the eight\u00a0 remaining stocks, it was agreed to set precautionary quotas considering the scientific advice available, and the status of many of these as minor by-catches. <\/p>  <p>  In November, I launched a public consultation on the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for 2021 fishing opportunities and the scientific advice for stocks as part of my Sustainability Impact Assessment.\u00a0 Each year, in order to inform Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the December Fisheries Council, an assessment of the potential impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken.\u00a0 To facilitate the assessment, an open consultation process is carried out, whereby stakeholders may submit comments and observations.\u00a0 I also met with stakeholders, including environmental NGO&rsquo;s, on 26 November to further discuss the proposal.\u00a0 The Sustainability Impact Assessment, which is informed by the scientific and technical experts of the Marine Institute and BIM and the views received from stakeholders, was presented to the Oireachtas and I discussed the issues and concerns with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture\u00a0and the Marine last week, in advance of the\u00a0negotiations on TACs and quota setting for 2021.\u00a0 The negotiations this year\u00a0will involve EU negotiations with\u00a0the UK in respect of shared stocks.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets down an ambitious programme of actions that promote a sustainable seafood industry,\u00a0technical measures that promote sustainability, decrease by-catch and protect fish stocks for the future, \u00a0aggressively tackle the issue of waste in our seas,\u00a0 work to eliminate illegal fishing and promote a culture of compliance.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to working to continue to build on the progress that has been\u00a0made to secure a sustainable future for our fishing industry and the coastal communities which depend upon it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800098#WRQQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme","counter":2048,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800098#WRQQ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2049,"qnumday":811,"qnumall":"[41379\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800098#WRQQ02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a decision has been made on an appeal relating to an ANC payment by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2050,"content":"<p>In order to be eligible for the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme, farmers must apply for the scheme by completing the relevant section of the Basic Payment Scheme application form.

Achieving single species MSY in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. MSY is rarely, if ever, attainable simultaneously for all species. Therefore, a predictions model based on all stocks being fished at MSY\u00a0is likely to be unrealistic and potentially misleading,\u00a0containing such degrees of uncertainty as to make them unusable in policy making. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800099#WRRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":2089,"qnumday":824,"qnumall":"[41574\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120800099#WRRR00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if it will be ensured that the 2018 commitments to ensure that effective bycatch reduction plans are developed which will progressively restore stocks that are subject to bycatch TACs will be delivered;
