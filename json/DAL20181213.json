The particular initiatives include co-operation in multi-agency responses, linkage of Tusla child and family support networks with family hubs and the provision of facilities in family resource centres.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla works in partnership with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and is a key partner on several inter-agency groups.  Bilateral meetings between the DRHE and Tusla take place monthly.  Tusla supports one-stop-shop assessment centres being led by the DRHE.  Tusla staff participate as required on issues involving child protection and welfare, educational welfare as well as domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  A key role in co-ordinating this multi-agency response is played by the Tusla homelessness liaison officer.<\/p>  <p>  While homelessness is not a reason for a referral to child protection services, there may be child protection or welfare concerns for some children.  Work is under way to ensure effective identification, referral, tracking and service response processes for children and families experiencing homelessness.  Tusla also undertakes visits to family hubs and emergency accommodation providers to ensure they are aware of their requirements under children first legislation and to clarify referral queries.  Tusla has progressed plans for the linkage of child and family support networks with family hubs and other homeless accommodation, and this work will continue in 2019.  Tusla is liaising with family resource centres to provide facilities where children can do their homework, receive nutritious food, avail of laundry facilities and receive family support services and other relevant supports.  This model operates in Mulhuddart, Ballyfermot and Ballymun.

To address affordability and quality, we have secured a 117% increase in funding over the past four budgets, which has doubled the number of children in receipt of various forms of subsidisation.  I have repeatedly stated that much more needs to be done over successive budgets to meet our aims fully in this area.<\/p> <p> I have been unequivocal in my support for better pay and conditions for childcare workers and the need for the sector to bring forward a sectoral employment order.  I have also introduced practical steps to improve the conditions of staff.  These have included an increase to ECCE capitation of 7% intended to improve pay rates in the sector.  Furthermore, by the end of 2019, my Department will have paid more than &euro;55 million to childcare providers in recognition of the administrative role they play in delivering the current childcare schemes.

While the targeted subsidies are welcome, the majority of families are still paying the equivalent of a second mortgage and there are major problems retaining staff.

Second, as the Deputy knows, because of the lack of investment for so many years, given that costs are going up, childcare providers are allowed some reasonable increase in fees and I think a 2% increase is reasonable.  The other thing the Pobal sector profile demonstrated is that the average rate of pay has gone up - not significantly but it is going up so it is important to attend to that.

Yes, I have and I have also sat down with a working group on which unions are also represented in terms of the wider employment forum set up by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

I have been speaking with organisations representing the employers sector.  They have not moved to the point where they can take part in that sectoral employment order but I have been encouraging and speaking to them.

Should it not be left up to the parents to make some of these decisions by transferring the nature of the subsidy from the cr&egrave;che institution to the parents to give them the flexibility to decide the best approach?  The recent 2016 census showed that 83% of parents were satisfied with their arrangements.  I believe they are satisfied typically because they make the arrangements.

It recognised the diverse range of family configurations in Ireland and the need for supports to be inclusive of all family forms so as to be effective.  In addition, I am pleased to confirm that, as promised in First 5, my Department recently established a dedicated parenting support policy unit, which will lead in co-ordinating the direction of parenting support policy and activity across Departments and State agencies.

The review was undertaken by two international experts in this field, Professor Barry Goldson and Professor Nicholas Hardwick.  The board carefully reviewed each recommendation made in the report and published its recommendations, together with the board&rsquo;s response, in July 2017.  The publication of the report's recommendations ensured that the supportive and developmental aims of the review were met.<\/p>  <p>  I established a review implementation group in March 2017 to oversee the implementation of all the various recommendations arising from a number of reviews carried out around the same time, including the recommendations of the operational review.  The group produced a coherent plan to implement all the recommendations, and its action plan, completed in May 2018, was published on my Department's  website.<\/p>  <p>  Since this group was established I am pleased to say that there is real evidence of positive change in the day to day operations of Oberstown, and this change is most recently reflected in HIQA's report of its inspections into the campus.  The board of management of Oberstown had a number of concerns about the publication of the report of the operational review and decided, after a careful and lengthy process of deliberation, including the commissioning of independent legal advice, that it was not safe to publish the full report of the review.  I sought legal advice from the Attorney General on the matter, who gave me similar advice that there would be significant legal risk in publishing the report in full.  Accordingly, after careful consideration, I concluded that it was not appropriate to publish the full report.<\/p>  <p>  I emphasise that my Department&rsquo;s focus, and that of Oberstown Children Detention Campus, is on the implementation of the recommendations so as to ensure there is a safe and stable environment in Oberstown for children detained there by the Children&rsquo;s Courts and for the staff who work there.  The terms of reference for the operational review included a provision for a feedback visit from the reviewers to present concluding observations and recommendations to staff, management and young people.<\/p><p> Oberstown envisaged that the visit would take place before the reviewers had finalised their report so that any comments could be taken into account in the final version of the report.  However, the reviewers maintained that it would not be possible to provide feedback until the final report had been completed.  As a result, the visit did not take place.<\/p> <p> I have no difficulty, in principle, if the reviewers wish to visit Oberstown again at this stage.

The proportion of staff with third-level qualifications is now 22%, up from 20% in 2017 and 18% in 2016.  Some 94% of staff now have, at a minimum, a relevant qualification at level 5, an increase of 6% since 2015.

My Department is not the employer and it does not pay the workers' salaries.  I cannot, therefore, set pay levels or determine working conditions.  However, I have taken several measures to help the sector address how its workforce is valued.  The Government has provided a 117% increase in investment in the sector over the past four budgets.  I have used some of this funding to raise the early childhood care and education, ECCE, capitation rate by 7% this September, to make programme support payments in recognition of administrative work and to provide a higher rate of capitation payment for graduate-led preschool rooms.  I hope that these measures, particularly the ECCE capitation increase, will have impacted on salaries when Pobal next reports in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly in the medium and long term, First 5, a whole-of-Government ten-year strategy for babies, young children and their families which I recently published, sets out a number of critical commitments to address workforce conditions.

As the Deputy will be aware, things change every day as Mr. Elliott continues his work on the investigation of files and alleged victims or abuse survivors contact Tusla as well as the Garda.

I wish to take this opportunity to note that children who arrive with their families and seek asylum remain in the care and custody of their parents.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that some of the referrals made to Tusla in respect of separated children seeking asylum are found to relate either to young people over the age of 18 or to those who are reunited with a parent or guardian who is already in the country.  As the Deputy knows, where a young person is under 18, they are taken into the care of Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  The Tusla separated children seeking asylum team has developed an effective model of working with the affected children and young people to identify the supports they need.  I am satisfied that the care provided to separated children seeking asylum is of a high standard and equal to that provided to other children in care.  The report notes specifically that the standard of assessment and the provision of services provided to separated children in Ireland compare favourably to those provided in many European jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  All separated children seeking asylum are assessed by a social worker from the specialist team working with these children on the day of their referral arrival and are placed in the care of Tusla.  The immigration arrangements of young asylum seekers, mainly in the age group of 15 to 17 years, are considered in the broader, holistic context of the child's needs.<\/p>  <p>  Many of these children may have high levels of vulnerability and have experienced trauma.  Many face problems and challenges on issues including separation and bereavement from family and friends, social isolation, language barriers, emotional and mental health problems, discrimination and racism.  In addition, they must live with the anxiety brought on by their possible removal from the country or uncertainty as to their future.<\/p>  <p>  Based on a clinical decision approach, they may be deemed to need a period of stability and care before being supported in making their application for residency.<\/p>  <p>  The new single procedures that have been put in place in the wake of the International Protection Act have seen significant improvements in waiting times for young people, especially those in aftercare.  Of the 93 aftercare cases currently open to Tusla's team for separated children's aftercare service, 70 have some form of residency permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300011#J00800","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1544701800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The Minister will have an opportunity to come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300011#J00900","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1544701800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We know there is some good care for the kids under 18 years of age.  So far this year, however, 105 children have arrived in Ireland seeking asylum status without a parent or guardian, yet to date this year only 15 have been granted international protection, while last year only 11 children were granted protection.  These are low figures.  I remind the Minister of some of the contents of the report.  It found that although Tusla is responsible for making an application on behalf of an unaccompanied minor, some social workers delay submitting applications for reasons including the view that an application is not in the child's best interest and that he or she may not be deemed ready for international protection, as well as the fear that negative decisions might lead to the child going missing.

Some of these children have come through horrible experiences, and at times a social worker may see fit to ensure that the child or young person is provided with counselling or other mental health supports in advance of the rigorous application process.  The social worker may believe it would be unwise and not in the child's best interest to put him or her through numerous interviews and applications while in a vulnerable state.  Such actions could cause undue trauma to the child.  I emphasise this rigorous application process.  Is the decision to delay wrong then?  Does it necessarily have a negative impact?

We are all aware of the potential economic and social impact of Brexit.  The staggeringly high stakes do not appear to bother many in the British political system.  When one reflects on yesterday's events Shakespeare's \"...day of sound and fury, Signifying nothing...\" is the most apt description.  The fundamental position remains the same as it was at this time yesterday, that barring some vague promises the backstop and the agreement as agreed remain.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to endorse that again today.<\/p>  <p>  In the face of the political chaos in Westminster our role must be to stand firm behind our deal and hope that our EU partners stand firm with us.  However, in spite of that support we still risk being the meat in the Brexit sandwich, with collateral damage to our economy due to the straitjacket politics of Brexiteers.  We must continue to work to ensure the backstop is upheld.  We must ensure that we avoid a disastrous hard border extending across the island from Newry to Derry.  In contrast to the slow car crash chaos in the UK we must provide clarity and certainty in this country.  However, instead of providing that clarity and certainty the Government continues to delay and prevaricate in publishing its plans for the case of a no-deal Brexit.

The UK has more than 100 plans that are constantly being refined and updated.  The EU Commission has published 70 updated plans.  The Irish Government has none.  How many plans has the Government commissioned?  When will it publish the detailed no-deal plans so all our citizens can buy into them and understand the consequences of a no-deal Brexit on their daily lives?  Can the T&aacute;naiste give a specific date for the plans to be published?

First, a European Council meeting is taking place today and tomorrow in which there will be a genuine effort by EU leaders and institutions to respond to the request of the British Prime Minister for more reassurance and clarity regarding the backstop, which has been the focus of so much political attention in Westminster in recent days.  However, that cannot happen in a way that undermines the purpose of the backstop or its implementation.  Nobody has been asked by the British Prime Minister to change the wording of the withdrawal agreement and nobody is talking about that.  What is being considered seriously now is how a political declaration can be put together that is real and provides reassurance for the many in Westminster who need it that the backstop represents no threat to them or the United Kingdom and instead is about providing reassurance on the island of Ireland, consistent with the obligations of the British and Irish Governments in the context of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, that under no circumstances in the future will border infrastructure re-emerge between the two jurisdictions on this island as a result of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to contingency, the Deputy knows there has been and continues to be a huge amount of work in preparation for all contingencies.

Last night the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il confirmed that he has once again bent the knee to renew Fine Gael's deal for another year.  On the one hand he is quite happy to come to the House and criticise the Government week in, week out for the Government's very obvious failings.  On the other hand he and his party, through the confidence and supply deal, are keeping the T&aacute;naiste and his Government in office.  It is a nonsensical position and we hear some of it again this morning.<\/p>  <p>  When it was cobbled together in 2016 the confidence and supply deal was heralded as a new beginning of new politics.  It has been anything but.  It has proved to be a political con job, designed to allow Fianna F&aacute;il the pretence of being in opposition while it is actually in government in all but name.  I believe it has been bad for politics, but more important it has been bad for citizens, not least the tens of thousands of citizens affected by the housing and homelessness crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Rents and house prices are out of control and continue to rise.  We see it time and again and I have raised the issue in this Chamber over and over.  It is borne out in the Residential Tenancies Board rent index, which was published this morning.  It shows that the national average rent is now &euro;1,122 per month.  In Dublin the average monthly rent is now a staggering &euro;1,620.  Not a single affordable home to rent or buy has been delivered by the Government over the past three years.  An entire generation of young people face the prospect of never owning their own home.  Under Fine Gael's watch homelessness has reached unprecedented levels, with some 10,000 people homeless.  Scandalously, 4,000 children will spend their Christmas in emergency accommodation this year.  We are aware that the real number of those who are homeless is a lot higher, closer to the 13,000 figure, as highlighted by my colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that this is a scandalous record.  It is a record that Fianna F&aacute;il seems happy to endorse.  What has that party got from these so called negotiations?  Absolutely nothing.  That is not surprising because together Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have voted down Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals for real rent certainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300013#L02200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1544703000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>We voted for 1,000-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300013#L02300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1544703000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Fine Gael opposed our proposal to introduce tax relief for renters and, along with Fianna F&aacute;il,  has continuously voted down the Focus Ireland amendment that would stop landlords evicting families into homelessness.

To its credit, Fianna F&aacute;il has recognised that.  It has said that in 2019, in the midst of Brexit preparations, Ireland does not need a general election.

From January 2008 to October of this year, the consumer price index, CPI, rose by 3%.

This has been forcefully stated by the CSO for years but the message does not seem to have penetrated the minds of Government officials.  The CPI, as its name indicates, is a price index.  The goods and services in its fixed basket are not those driving up the cost of living for people who are struggling.  The main problem is the rise in rents.

However, there is another side, and that is workers' pay - people's incomes.  Ireland has a far larger share of workers on low incomes compared to other European countries.  The Irish living wage is calculated on the basis of the actual cost of living facing people in both rural and urban areas.  It is estimated that a single person working on a full-time basis would need to be paid &euro;464 a week in order to meet a basic standard of living.  The national minimum wage is &euro;372 per week, &euro;92 short of meeting basic need, assuming the person is in full-time work.

There is a need to continue to build on the protections that we have for tenants.  However, we also need to be honest about other elements of the data we have seen this week.  We are seeing a declining number of landlords.  Without landlords, we do not get properties that are available for rent.

Undoubtedly, our priority has been to protect tenants at a time when rental prices have been increasing too rapidly.

That is why we need a strong RTB and it is why we have legislated to give it more powers.  We will legislate to give it more powers again to make sure that landlords are not abusing the lack of supply in terms of price gouging.  We will continue to do that and will listen to other political parties in this House that have constructive proposals in that regard, as we have done to date.  Ultimately, the pressures on the housing market generally and on the rental market in particular are as a result of a lack of supply which we are addressing as part of a five-year strategy which we are only halfway through.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of sectoral wage agreements, as the Deputy knows, we need to ensure that the Government commits to wage increases, particularly across the public sector, in line with what we can afford and in line with agreements that have been made.  To accelerate that or to raise expectations without having the Estimates to deliver it in terms of budgets would be highly irresponsible.

That programme does invaluable work because it makes a difference, it is poverty focused, it is about community empowerment, it is directed at the most marginalised and it has been untied.  With the new White Paper coming, how committed is the Government to policy coherence, particularly when we are seeing examples of policy incoherence?  I will give one example on tax.  During a previous Leaders' Questions, I outlined a number of steps where each positive step we took on tax transparency was accompanied by a \"but\" - a backward step.  The policy incoherence is giving the aid but then not following through on the tax justice of the developing world.<\/p>  <p>  At a recent event in Dublin, the Rwandan ambassador made the point that $63 billion in illicit flows leaves the developing world.  That is more than the foreign direct investment and aid going into those developing countries.  Policy coherence would mean Ireland taking meaningful steps on tax justice.  The T&aacute;naiste may say that we got rid of the single malt, which is positive but it does not go far enough.  What was needed was to take the steps the BEPS process has designed to tackle the underlying problem and prevent replacement structures emerging.<\/p>  <p>  The policy incoherence is also seen in trade treaties in the imbalance between what the developed country gains and the minor gains for the developing world.  For example, the Ireland-Ghana tax treaty prevents Ghana taxing the capital gains of mines, factories and large businesses owned by Irish companies.  No spillover analysis was done prior to the treaty, which allowed for that and other examples of unfairness.<\/p>  <p>  It is shameful that because of our aid reputation, countries in the global south want to trade with Ireland because they trust us.  I know our ambassadors and other embassy staff are working on these trade relations.  Are they on that page of policy coherence?  I know there is a role for the private sector, but the danger is that it is moving away from this coherence.  How committed is the Government to including binding human rights agreements, rights standards and environmental standards when negotiating these treaties?  Where stands the Government in implementing our business and human rights policy?<\/p>  <p>  When we discussed the EU-Colombia trade agreement, we were assured about these human rights agreements and yet since then there have been land grabs, forcible displacement, exploitation and intimidation of workers.

The latest budget provided an increase of &euro;110 million on the previous budget allocation across broader overseas development aid.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy would expect, the new White Paper will prioritise areas such as gender equality, reducing humanitarian need, climate action, climate resilience and strengthening governance in different parts of the world.

Of course, we need to try to ensure that domestic policy in Ireland is consistent with what we are trying to do elsewhere, whether that is from a climate perspective, a gender perspective, a reproductive rights perspective or whether it is transparency in taxation to ensure that large multinationals pay their fair share of tax.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach have been clear on that.

That means that as well as giving the aid, we should also support them in their capacity to collect taxes from the multinational companies that are making a fortune in developing countries.  It also means being fair to them when it comes to the tax and trade treaties to which we are party.  To me that is real policy coherence.  The Government could end our opt-out from Article 12 of the OECD multilateral instrument, which is a measure against tax avoidance.  The Government could insist that our tax treaty partners sign up to Article 4.  It could insist on binding human rights and environmental safeguards.<\/p>  <p>  Policy coherence is not a dreamy romantic ideal.  It can be realised and it is a stated aim of the Lisbon treaty.

It is entirely right and appropriate that we in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann take this time, on the eve of the centenary, to remember and reflect on this most significant act in our journey to independence and nationhood.  This week, a century ago, the voice of the people was heard as never before - not through force of arms but through the ballot box, the transformative power of participatory democracy, and pen and paper.<\/p>  <p>  It was truly the first occasion in Irish history when all the people of Ireland, men and women, could take centre stage in shaping the future of their country.  Like all the events we remember as part of the decade of centenaries, the election was not a simple or isolated one.  It was not experienced at the time, nor can it be remembered now, through a single political perspective.  It was the election which saw women vote and run for parliamentary seats for the first time, and the one which saw large swathes of Ireland&rsquo;s disenfranchised poor, that is, those without property, vote for the first time, too.  As a result, more than 1.9 million Irish people were able to exercise their political rights.  Two thirds of them had never voted before in any election.  It was truly an act of mass political participation, never witnessed before on this island.  <\/p>  <p>  The independence movement, or national movement, won more than two thirds of the available seats in Ireland.  It was accepted as a mandate from the electorate to assemble in Dublin as D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to win international recognition and start building up the institutions of what would become an independent Irish State.  In another moment that broke new political ground, Countess Markievicz became the first woman elected to the Westminster Parliament, although she chose instead to take her seat as a Deputy in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>It was also the election which saw the Irish Parliamentary Party, having dedicated so many long years of service to the establishment of a self-governing Home Rule Parliament in Dublin, eclipsed by the demand for greater self-government and overwhelmed by the events of the previous few years.  It is fitting that we, the current guardians of the Irish parliamentary tradition, should acknowledge the role of that party in our nation&rsquo;s story.<\/p> <p> Of course, the 1918 election also underlined a profound political gulf on the island with the increase in seats for the Unionist Party, concentrated in the north eastern part of the island.  As I said, much had passed since the last election had taken place in 1910: the 1913 Lockout, the Home Rule Crisis, the slaughter and destruction of the First World War, the Easter Rising and the executions and repression which followed, the failed Lloyd George negotiations of 1916 and an anti-climactic Irish Convention and in 1918, the mounting threat of conscription.<\/p> <p> Through our commemorations of the centenaries of the major events of those years we have, I hope, engaged with our shared history in a way that is honest, measured, authentic and appropriate.  We have done it in a way that has been open to the participation and contribution of all traditions and communities on the island.  We have done it in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, which was another historic moment of transformative democratic self-determination on this island.<\/p> <p> We will soon commemorate the sitting of the First D&aacute;il in January and other events for which the election in 1918 crucially set the stage.  In the months and years to come, we will mark and reflect on the struggle for Independence; the foundation of this State; the tragedy of our Civil War; partition and the establishment of Northern Ireland; the experience of minorities and Border communities on the island in Ireland in the period 1919-1923; and finally &ldquo;taking her place among the nations of the earth&rdquo; when we joined the League of Nations in September 1923.<\/p> <p> As we mark the centenaries to come, there is an even greater need for us to do so in an inclusive manner, without either apology or partisan glorification, mindful that the events surrounding the achievement of statehood did not come without a price, a very heavy price in some cases, leaving painful legacies that echo to this day.  How we mark our history is a sign of how we want to live our future.  Today, it is fitting that we, as a House, take this moment to recall the extraordinary achievement which the general election of 1918 represented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300017#P02600","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544706000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ar an 14 Nollaig 1918, tharla eachtra a bh&iacute; thar a bheith stairi&uacute;il i stair na h&Eacute;ireann.

First because it was the first election in which all men over 21 and women over 30 years of age had a vote.  Women had to wait until we had a native Government before they got votes on the same basis as men.  It was historic because it was the election that decided to form this D&aacute;il or independent Parliament.  It also was very important because, as has been said by the T&aacute;naiste, Countess Markievicz, who obviously took her seat in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, became the first elected woman either in Britain or Ireland.

The result and the changes were absolutely seismic.<\/p>  <p>  What were the messages from that election?  The electorate spoke out against conscription.  They spoke out in democratic acceptance of the need of the establishment of the First D&aacute;il and indeed independence and spoke out in electing a woman for the very first time.  Countess Markievicz, a warrior queen, powerful, fearless and a decisive and a forceful leader fought for women to be part of society on an equal footing with men, and thus started a century of struggle for equality and for justice.  This year was and has been an opportunity to celebrate exceptional women like Constance, like Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, Winnie Kearney and others who have gone before us.  We stand on their shoulders and the shoulders of women over the past 100 years.  I include our mothers and our grandmothers in that.  Women who day by day, step by step, carried us forward and created opportunity and gave us choice.  They were women who lived through changing times and in small acts and great gestures, they threw off and tore apart the matrix of discrimination.  It has to be accepted that 100 years on from that moment we have still not ended the journey which saw its first major achievement in 1918.<\/p>  <p>  We should use this milestone to reflect on the road ahead and also recognise the achievements of 1918 and to acknowledge, in my limited speaking time, the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas in this, the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 committee chaired by Senator Bacik and the Women's Caucus chaired by Deputy Catherine Martin.  This has been a seminal year for feminism.  The battle for equal rights absolutely continues and to get greater female participation in politics.  More work needs to be done on important societal issues such as sexual and domestic violence, gender pay gaps, pension inequality and maternal and reproductive health, to name but a few.

A defining point when poets, visionaries and soldiers came together with the mass of our nation to build a republic.  They voted for equality and independence.  They voted to break the link with Britain.<\/p><p>They voted to make good the promises of the Proclamation, and they voted for Sinn F&eacute;in.  The election in 1918 was described as the \"Sinn F&eacute;in election\".  The Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto of 1918 stated unequivocally that Sinn F&eacute;in would achieve its aims by withdrawing Irish representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government, or any other foreign Government, to legislate for Ireland.<\/p> <p> As we meet almost 100 years to the day, it is, therefore, telling and ironic that there are those in this D&aacute;il today who would espouse otherwise.

She was an abstentionist MP, Constance Markievicz, the most unmanageable of revolutionaries.  As an Irish woman and the President of Sinn F&eacute;in, I pay a particular tribute to her today, and also to Winifred Carney, who contested the same election in the Victoria ward of east Belfast, but who sadly was not returned.  Markievicz was a disrupter and a rebel of her time.  She was a woman who stood on picket lines with workers.  She stood with tenants against landlords and she stood on battle lines against the British.  She was the scourge of the establishment and she still troubles those in power today.  She remains an inspiration for all of those who hold to the principles of freedom and unity.  I wonder what she would make of the D&aacute;il today, where party-political self-interest pretends to be the national interest.  I have no doubt she would berate those in power and stand for citizens' rights, for equality and for Irish unity, as we do still.  One hundred years on, we are still about transforming Ireland and uniting our country.  We are about building, shaping and leading the Republic.  Our task, like the Sinn F&eacute;in MPs elected in 1918, is to realise the Republic of the 1916 Proclamation.<\/p>  <p>  Today should not simply be about commemoration or remembrance.  It is not good enough to bow our heads to the past.  It is about lifting our faces to the future, delivering on the sacrifices of the past, and building a new united Ireland and a Republic worthy of the name.  Today is an opportunity to reflect on the need to end the division of our country, definitively, and to bring about a united Ireland.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in's central task.  Unfortunately, there are people gathered in this place who take a different view.  Every time Irish unity is raised, they bow the head and say, \"Not now\", that this is not the time.  I say otherwise, because now is the time to build a united Ireland.  Let us plan for a referendum on Irish unity.  Let us give the people of this island their say, North and South, in accordance with provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  Let us not just look back in awe of the great men and women of 1918, but let us look forward and let us finish their work.  That is the only fitting way to honour their legacy.

The Great War had just ended.  A total of 19 million were dead and many more were injured.  There had never before been warfare on that scale, or with such brutality.  The price paid in blood accelerated the already legitimate claim by working people for political equality, and as others have said, they secured the vote for the first time in the momentous election of 1918.  The choice before the people was to vote for a party, nationalist or unionist, which would take its seats in London, or for the new pro-independence party, led by Eamon de Valera, which would not.  As a UK-wide general election, it was conducted using the single-seat, first-past-the-post voting system, not our multi-seat, single-transferable vote.  As such, where three or four candidates were in serious contention, there was a possibility of the vote being split, which would give the seat to the leading candidate, even with a minority of votes.  That was the context.  The result of the 1918 election could not be known in advance, but it could be anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  In the December 1910 general election, Labour had taken 42 seats.  Unfortunately, they were almost all in England, with a few in Scotland and Wales.  It was still a debate as to whether the cause of working people would be better served by the nascent British Labour Party or by the establishment of a separate Irish party.  In 1912, in Clonmel, that question was answered decisively with the foundation of my party, the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress, a single political body designed to further the interests of working people.  James Connolly had taken part in the 1916 Rising.  Connolly's immortal words were that: \"The cause of labour is the cause of Ireland, the cause of Ireland is the cause of labour.\"  1916, and later 1922, split the Labour movement, especially in the North where many workers were also unionists.  In 1918, the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress stood aside from the election.  That avoided any situation where the nationalist vote would be split.  As one test of that, Labour had taken 43% of the vote in Dublin College Green in the 1915 by-election.  It was a probability that Labour would have taken a number of seats all around Ireland, but instead, the people were given a clear choice on the national question.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Parliamentary Party, the legacy of Parnell and Redmond, only retained six of out its 73 seats from the previous election.  The independence movement gained 73 MPs, while Irish Unionists had 26 MPs, five more than in 1910, including three Labour Unionist MPs who won seats in Belfast.  In this decade of centenaries, there is a need for deeper reflection on the complex and nuanced set of political preferences that prevailed in Ireland 100 years ago.<\/p><p>Had Labour stood candidates in that important 1918 election, there could have been a split in the independence vote and the overturning of the Irish Parliamentary Party would probably have been significantly less total.  To have had more Labour MPs and fewer of de Valera's elected then might have been a good thing for Ireland, as things worked out, given partition, civil war and a repressive clerical State, the legacy of which we are still unwinding.  However, none of these things was visible at the time.<\/p> <p> In Connolly's words, the cause of Ireland was to be resolved, and that was the central focus.  Labour stood aside to allow people to choose whether or not they wanted to back the national drive for independence.  However, Labour was not entirely absent from the First D&aacute;il.  The leader of the Labour Party, Tom Johnson, was asked to write the democratic programme of the First D&aacute;il, which we will commemorate next year.  It was read into the record of the D&aacute;il on 17 January 1919, pledging Labour's values of \"Liberty, Equality and Justice for all\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300019#R00800","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544707200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300020#S00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1544707200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The election happened just over one month from the ending of the First World War.  Contrary to establishment versions of history, that war ended because of revolution.  It ended because of German soldiers and sailors refusing to continue the war and, instead, establishing workers, sailors and soldiers councils, with the Kaiser abdicating in a desperate attempt to save capitalism in Germany.  That was one of the many reverberations of the Russian Revolution that had happened a year previously and which spread ideas like workers' control, the liberation of women and national self-determination across Europe and around the world.  It was widely welcomed by workers, the oppressed and those seeking an end to the war.<\/p>  <p>  It was no different in Ireland, which, for example, saw over 10,000 pack into the Mansion House to welcome the October Revolution.  The 1918 election is widely known for being the first parliamentary election here where there was universal male franchise and, after decades of struggle, women winning right to vote.  The key event in 1918 was the mass movement against conscription earlier in the year, which was successful and saw Ireland's first general strike.  That general strike also saw the decisive break with the pro-war, pro-imperialist Irish Parliamentary Party, which was then reflected in the general election.  It demonstrated the power of the working class and the labour movement, which was seen in an explosion in militancy and membership of the trade union movement, with whole new sections becoming unionised.<\/p>  <p>  In 1918 Labour had a stronger base across the island than Sinn F&eacute;in.  The result of the election was the manifestation of the desire for self-determination and a rejection of imperialism, but the result also illustrated sectarian division; for example, in Ulster most contests were along sectarian lines, although in Belfast Labour did contest.  It was a lost opportunity for the labour movement.  It was a mistake for Labour to decide to wait and to allow Sinn F&eacute;in to take a majority in the D&aacute;il.  It was a missed opportunity to put forward working class politics - an internationalist anti-imperialism that would appeal to and unite working class people.  It came just before momentous class battles like the engineers strike in Belfast and the Limerick Soviet.  It was a missed opportunity to bring together working-class people, Catholic and Protestant, to fight for a socialist Ireland where the wealth would be under democratic control, which would be internationalist in outlook and would naturally align with working-class people in Britain and across Europe.  That is a struggle we are still committed to today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300020#S00400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1544707200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I am very proud to commemorate the election of 1918.  We should remind ourselves that what brought this about was a mass movement against conscription and, before that, the 1913 Lockout and the Easter rebellion, as well as, in no small measure, the Suffragettes, who at one stage threw a hatchet at Herbert Asquith, smashed windows in Belfast and Dublin and used very strong civil disobedience to get their right to be recognised and to vote.  Having won recognition of the right to vote, masses of people did vote, with the results we know.<\/p><p>We should commemorate that as the first explosion of the democratic right of the people to vote.  What we need to do now is look at what still needs to be achieved.  If that was a democratic revolution, we now need an economic one.

[there shall be a] scheme for the care of the Nation&rsquo;s aged and infirm, who shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the Nation&rsquo;s gratitude and consideration. ...

We now have to fight for an economic revolution where we get to say what is produced, how it is produced and how it is distributed, where it is not the markets and a tiny elite of less than 5% around the globe who decide for the rest of us how we are serviced by our own labour and by society.  That economic revolution will deliver the democratic programme of 1918.  Ordinary men, women and children will be able, after an economic revolution, to say what is needed and how it is distributed.  It will not be down to the vagaries of a ridiculous, chaotic market that drives us, ultimately, to war, which is what led to the revolutions Deputy Paul Murphy spoke about.

It is rather ironic in light of Brexit.  Breaking that connection meant different things to different people: repeal of the Union, some form of home rule or a republic.  Of course, after 1916, there was no doubt what form breaking that connection would take.  The change had come about because of the extent of the executions in 1916 and the very tragic stories behind some of them, and also the return to Ireland of those who had been imprisoned in England and Wales.<\/p>  <p>  Before the 1918 election we had the by-elections in 1917 and the election of Count Plunkett and of Eamon de Valera.  However, the 1918 election was a key moment in modern Irish history.  It saw the defeat of the Irish Parliamentary Party, a considerable victory for the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and an increase for unionists, and the role of Labour has to be acknowledged.  The historian F.S.L. Lyons called it a bitter, ugly election, but it was a result that completely transformed the face of politics.<\/p>  <p>  It was significant that women, albeit those over the age of 30, were able to vote, along with men over the age of 21.  It was significant also in that it led to the establishment of the First D&aacute;il, which we will commemorate in January.  It was significant for the election of Countess Markievicz, the first woman MP elected to Westminster in spite of British efforts to take that accolade from her.  It was the last parliamentary election for a 32-county republic.  It also saw the ascendancy of Carson and unionism, and the creation of a Protestant state for a Protestant people, which led to decades of institutional prejudice against Catholics, the effects of which we again see re-merging with Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  It was significant for the fact of women voting, the election of Countess Markievicz and the progress that came from that for women in Ireland, albeit slowly.  We are so far ahead of other countries in this regard.  As a woman Teachta D&aacute;la, I am very conscious of those countries where women cannot vote and cannot be members of parliament, where they are not even allowed to drive a car and not allowed outside their homes without a male companion, where they have no say about their sexual health or about the number of children they can have.<\/p>  <p>  Putting all that together, it is very important that we know our history, that we remember it and commemorate it, for example, in regard to the significance of the 1918 election and the First D&aacute;il in January.  It is ironic, however, that as we were coming into the decade of commemorations, history was being downgraded as a subject at junior certificate level, and it is good to see the Minister, Deputy McHugh, is reviewing that.  It is important it is a compulsory subject so our young people can understand their history, know where we came from and develop the critical analysis that goes with the study of history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300020#S00700","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1544707200,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Tomorrow, 14 December, is the 100th anniversary of the general election which saw the First D&aacute;il in 1919.  It was a significant election on so many levels, not least the fact it was the first general election in ten years and it occurred just over one month after Armistice Day, when the war to end all wars stopped.  It was an election that saw the size of the electorate increase from 700,000 voters to 1.93 million by extending the franchise, albeit a franchise limited to women over 30, with specific conditions, and to all men over 21.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that voters were galvanised by anti-military and anti-conscription sentiment throughout the country.  One woman, Countess Markievicz, was elected to that D&aacute;il and became a Minister.  Unbelievably and unfortunately, it took 60 years before we had another female Minister, when a fellow Galwegian, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, was appointed.  From the First to the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, we have gone from one female Minister out of 105 Members to 35 female Deputies, including Ministers, out of 158.<\/p> <p> The glaring absence of female Deputies in the intervening 100 years has had profound and detrimental consequences for women and society in general.  It led to a complete absence of open and balanced public discourse on subjects of vital importance.  Indeed, successive male-dominated Governments worked hand in hand with a male-dominated Catholic hierarchy to shape a society that reflected their narrow and limited version of morality.  They created an Ireland that was unequal and positively hostile to women and mothers.  It gave us the Ireland of denial, deception and deceit in which church and State worked hand in hand with the male-dominated medical profession to defeat the most basic mother and baby scheme in 1951.  It created the Ireland of the institutions, the legacy of which we are still dealing with.  It was the Ireland of the Magdalen laundries, industrial schools and mother and baby homes.  It gave us the Ireland of inequality which allowed men up to 65 to disinherit their wives completely.  It permitted a marriage bar under which married women had to leave their jobs.  It did not consider women fit to sit on juries until the very courageous M&aacute;ir&iacute;n de Burca took her case in 1973.  It was an Ireland that thought it was acceptable to interfere in the marital privacy of the bed, forcing a very courageous woman, Mrs McGee, to go to the Supreme Court which led to the Irish solution to the Irish problem of 1979.  I could go on and on but will restrict myself to a couple of other issues.  Marital rape was unrecognised until 1991 and the eighth amendment took 35 years to remove from the Constitution.  Deputies, particularly female Deputies, have a duty to recognise what has gone before and to shape a different Ireland in which a home and public health are basic human rights.  We must be a voice for peace in circumstances in which we are shaping up, 100 years after a war, to have a European army.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300020#S00800","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544707800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We are celebrating the events which took place on 14 December 100 years ago.  Women were allowed to vote for the first time, which was a huge milestone.  It was the year Countess Markievicz was elected but refused to take her seat at Westminster.  She chose to wait as a revolutionary to be elected to the First D&aacute;il.  She was an inspirational character.  Deputy Howlin referred to the foundation of the Labour Party in my town of Clonmel, which is true.  It has been a generous and hard-working party representing ordinary people and it was a pity that some years ago it was prevented by violent protests from holding the celebration of its 100th anniversary in the town.  There is no place for intimidation like that in a democracy.  We must support all political parties in that regard.  The same is true of the celebration today.  The extension of democracy and our Constitution were wonderful things in terms of the freedom they brought about.  We were enabled to become a sovereign people.<\/p>  <p>  Now, however, we look at Brexit and the discussions in Europe.  In a lot of ways, a heavy-handed Europe is the cause of a lot of what is behind Brexit.  It has not allowed member states to self-determine and there has been too much overreach on its part.  It is sad because, as sovereign countries, we should be allowed to make our own laws and regulations within justifiable reason.  We see also the ongoing persecution of women and children in the Middle East but have no debate on it in this Parliament.  We had one debate about four years ago when a number of Members were able to raise a Topical Issue thanks to the Ceann Comhairle.  However, we turn a blind eye to it in general.  Our neutrality is also being challenged on a daily basis.<\/p>  <p>  Above all, I note that Fine Gael, supported at the time by the Labour Party, abandoned and destroyed local democracy.  There has been too much centralisation of power, which is enormously regressive.  The Labour Party has accepted that a mistake was made - I commend Deputy Howlin on that - and is trying to introduce Private Members' legislation to reverse the removal of accountability and democracy from local people.  Too much centralisation is the reason we are failing to build the houses we need to look after our homeless.  There is too much bureaucracy and centralisation.  I salute the former members of local town councils and local authorities who provided voluntary service out of a sense of community to improve their local areas.  It was not about money.  We have too much of the heavy hand and too much denial of democracy to people.  As we celebrate the 1918 general election 100 years on, we must take a look at ourselves and ask what is happening.  There are 10,000 people on the streets, nearly 4,000 of whom are children.  A half dozen successive housing Ministers have failed utterly to deal with that.  Local authorities are not delivering either.  When we had town councils, borough and district councils, such as the council in Clonmel, there were people on those who gave service and were there to help the people.<\/p>  <p>  Like other Members, I refer to the banking collapse and the punitive behaviour of banks we bailed out.  Permanent TSB is the most recent example as it sells off loans to vulture funds.  A third force militia was operating in Roscommon last week, including, I am told, ex-UVF members from Northern Ireland.  There is no place in our modern democracy for those people.  We have An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which we must support, and our Army if necessary.  We do not need a third force acting at the behest of vulture funds and destroying people's lives.  Those affected include sick and vulnerable people and families who have been split up.  People have been forced into all kinds of situations by the greed of the bankers we bailed out.  As we celebrate this 100th anniversary, we should not allow that to which I refer to go on under our noses.  It is happening everywhere.  Farmers are being evicted or threatened with eviction and ordinary householders are being evicted.  We are trying to solve a housing crisis while turning a blind eye to the mayhem and treachery taking place in the use of a third force militia to evict people from houses and family farms.  They are nothing short of thugs and they would have been dealt with a lot differently 100 years ago.  They have no place in our modern democracy.  We must stand up for our people and support them.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  They are the people who have made the sacrifices to pay the taxes with which we are bailing out these so-called banks and this is the treatment they are receiving.  The courts are not protecting them either while the situation with county sheriffs and their lucrative fees is a further sad indictment as we discuss this event 100 years later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300021#T00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1544707800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300021#T00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1544707800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Not only did we see the franchise extended to some women in that year, we saw it extended also to a huge number of men who had never voted before.  The result was in large part a legacy of the events of 1916 and the First World War when heavily resisted attempts to introduce conscription in Ireland had been made.  Attempts were also made to conscript 1916 internees at Frongoch internment camp in Wales and those were also resisted through effective handling by the prisoners, in particular the camp commandant, Michael Staines, who subsequently stood and was elected in 1918.  My grandfather, who was also an internee at Frongoch, was his director of elections.  Frongoch was dubbed \"the university of revolution\" where prisoners were prepared for release through a major push to reorganise and strengthen the volunteers.  Women played a huge role in the aftermath of the Rising through fundraising and supporting the families of internees.  Many of those women who did not qualify to vote on age and income grounds worked actively on the election campaign as can be seen from the military service records.  The election result was no accident but was highly organised by a cohesive movement.  While the election elected people to a parliament which did not, in effect, exist, the optimism regarding what could be created must have been a major influence on the result.  The democratic programme of the First D&aacute;il was short, visionary and inclusive.  It declared that the nation's sovereignty extended not only to all men and women of the nation, but to all its material possessions.  It reaffirmed that all right to private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare.<\/p><p>It went on to say \"It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter\".

It should also be a regret that we never built the republic aspired to in the Democratic Programme.

The work which has been done by the V&oacute;tail 100 committee and by the women's caucus has been useful in reminding us of the need to open that door ever wider.  It is true that in the first 50 years as Members concentrated and looked inwards to set up the Constitution, to keep this House safe, and to make it stand, the door closed slightly on female emancipation, though no more than slightly.<\/p>  <p>  Equally and worryingly, at the same time 2 million of our people closed the door as they left and took the boat to different parts of the world.

I am nervous because Cork Deputies would, obviously, have a much better knowledge of the issue than I would.  However, I have sufficient knowledge of the city to see what has gone wrong in Cork.  It is probably one of the worst examples of depopulation of a city centre with the sprawl ever outwards, the ever lengthening commute times and under-population in the city.  It also has this very dysfunctional boundary that has existed between the county and the city where the county placed development without consideration of the impact on the city.  As happened in Dublin and elsewhere, both jurisdictions were competing for rates space.  That needs to stop and it needs to change.  Cork is grinding to a halt, as are all our cities, with gridlock.  It needs to start concentrating development again for social, environmental and economic reasons.  This amendment would seek that in any review mechanism of the boundaries and the issue of what type of development is taking place would be looked at, and that a check would be put, in particular on the county, on using the new arrangements to continue the old ways of doing things where they were really ignoring the need for a strategic balance in how the city develops versus the county and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The amendment sets out the specific clause that consideration of what is happening in area development, especially by the county, is a key issue in the consideration of boundaries to try to put a check on that potential for continued, atrocious and unsustainable planning in the Cork city and county areas.  I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300027#DD03200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1544711100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I would like to speak to the amendment.  Deputy Ryan is well able to speak on behalf of the people of Cork, especially as he come down to my parish to get married.  I would never doubt his good intentions for the people of Cork.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will have detrimental consequences for people living in County Cork and in the constituency I represent.  I have no doubt about this.  I have brought this matter up time and again, including on Committee Stage with amendments I tabled and in a motion I tabled in the D&aacute;il last year, which surprisingly got no support from any Cork Deputies, even though most of them are representing County Cork and the areas that are totally opposed to the boundary extension.  This Bill is being rushed through the D&aacute;il.  On Committee Stage, some of my amendments were ruled out of order, which I found a bit strange.  Other Deputies found this with regard to Galway.  We are not getting enough time to debate this issue, which is very serious issue.  While we might have the time to debate it now, it is like chariots with horses racing through to make sure they get across the line.  On the way, tens of thousands of people will be affected.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe the financial settlement needs to be for at least 15 years so the county can continue to grow.  Anything less than that - and there is talk of reviews taking place within the first few months - will be detrimental.  Reviews could affect any compensation package not already in place.  It is like signing a blank cheque at the moment.  We do not know what the county is going to get or what the real terms and conditions are.  We felt from the initial discussions that it was going to be over a number of years.  I gather that this is changing and it could be just a number of months before there are reviews.  We need to have assurances that if Cork City Council is unable or unwilling to make a financial settlement, the Minister of State would guarantee that payment through his Department.  We cannot find ourselves in a situation where Cork County Council and Cork City Council head into court to fight this.<\/p><p>It will create further unnecessary disagreements between two parties that need to work together for the betterment of city and county.  Rural areas such as Blarney and Tower have said through their local representatives that they do not want to be taken in under the city expansion.  This is being forced against them no matter what discussions have taken place at council level.  The message relayed back to me is that Cork County Council completely opposes this.  That includes every councillor from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and across the political spectrum, but they are all being ignored.  Democracy is completely gone out the window here.  The Government is railroading this through regardless.  Approximately 6,000 signatures were handed in from the people of Ballincollig and its surrounds opposing this but they went missing and cannot be found now.  This city boundary could lead to major losses in the county that I represent, where ten businesses have closed in the past two months.  I am not going to go through them again as I have often raised those issues here between post offices, pubs, schools and whatever.  That is rural Ireland and County Cork is haemorrhaging badly.  While I accept that the cities might be building and progressing well, counties are not.  In this situation County Cork is not.<br\/><br\/>We do not know what kind of compensation package is going to be put in place.  We do not know for how long or what guarantees are being put in place.  Cork County Council and the people of Cork county are being forced to accept a blank cheque, which will have detrimental effects going forward.  It is a complete and utter land grab and nothing else.  I found very few people who support it but the support unfortunately came from the powers that be within Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  They should not have supported it.  They should have spoken to their councillors on the ground.  It is the very same as the local authority boundary changes.  We are not allowed speak about them at committee level, we are not allowed speak about them in here when Courtmacsherry, Timoleague and all those areas have been taken out without the consent of the people.  The majority of the people said they wanted to stay in the Clonakilty-Skibbereen electoral area but they were moved and did not have a say.  More and more, as time goes on, people's voices are not being listened to in this country.  The majority of people and the local councillors are not being listened to and this is going to have a detrimental effect.  I refer to the expansion of Cork city to the detriment of the county; a local boundary change for a local authority; the Castletownbere transportation plan to which people are totally opposed; and the Skibbereen plastic factory where I am going to attend a meeting later this evening.  In all these cases the people feel as if their voices are not being heard.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State has to give assurances at least if this is railroaded through and I as an elected representative have no say in it.

That might be the kind of politics they want but it is not the kind of politics that the people on the ground want or what councillors and Fine Gael supporters want.  I tabled a motion in the House last year opposing this but I received no support from any Deputy from Cork.  I knew what damage it was going to cause to my county and I certainly could not support anything like it.  If the city council is unable or unwilling to make a financial settlement for 15 years, will the Minister of State guarantee that his Department will make it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300027#DD03300","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544711700,"counter":374,"content":"<p>There are two very different issues.  I will not accept the amendment but the points Deputy Eamon Ryan made are correct.  The sections about Cork are included in this Bill primarily because of the issues the Deputy raised concerning the city centre being hollowed out.  While much of the development of Cork in the past 30 years has happened outside the existing city boundary, to the outside observer and many public representatives who are not from Cork, that area is naturally in Cork city.  There are large suburbs such as Glanmire on the north side and Togher and others on the south side which are contiguous with Cork city and which should, therefore, be in the same local authority area.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding metropolitan governance in recent years, Deputy Buckley will know about the Cork area strategic plan, CASP, under which the two local authorities examined strategic planning in the areas that crossed boundaries between city and county.  The metropolitan area strategic plans, which are part of the national planning framework, will provide a governance system for future development, not just within the Cork boundary as extended by this legislation, but in the catchment area outside so that the doughnut effect does not happen again.  A paper will go to Cabinet shortly, I hope, on the issue of metropolitan governance itself.  Currently, the Southern Regional Assembly, which is a large body stretching from Wicklow to Clare and covering everything south of that line, has responsibility for regional planning strategies.  Something that is being actively considered is a dedicated part of that authority to examine Cork's planning structures into the future, not just in respect of zonings but also the transportation and retail strategies.  The land use and transportation strategy, LUTS, document goes back many years and is probably well out of date now, which is why this metropolitan governance paper is being prepared.  We need a national plan on how those areas will be dealt with in the future and need to ensure that where plans are out of date they will be updated.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Michael Collins, nothing could be further from the truth in respect of his allegation of it being rammed through.  I entered this House in 2011 and the process of reviewing the boundary between Cork city and county started at end of that year.  The discussion started many years previously but in 2011, the formal process started of reports, engagement with local authorities at membership and management level, engagement with the Department and with every sort of stakeholder in Cork, particularly with people trading in the city and the county.  The point we are at today is, hopefully, one of the end points in an official process that has been going on for the past eight or nine years and an argument that has gone on for 20 years. <\/p>  <p>  I understand the Deputy's position when he says it is bad for Cork but it was not accidental that no other Cork Deputy voted for his motion when it came before the House.  They disagree with him and people are entitled to disagree with one another on these issues and on any other issue.  In response to the specific question he raised, we accepted a number of amendments on Committee Stage along the lines of what he is saying.  There was a perception in County Cork that the financial settlement could be reviewed after a number of months.  The Deputy said it should be 15 years and we are saying that a review mechanism will be available after ten years.  That mechanism will involve both local authorities and whoever is in my role at the time.  It is a significant change from what was in the first draft and relates specifically to the points the Deputy and others raised on Second Stage.  On the Deputy's suggestion that I must guarantee the financial settlement, notwithstanding recent events in other places, I cannot personally guarantee any financial settlements.  What we did include and what was raised, I think by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, on Committee Stage, is the issue of contract debt.<\/p><p>That is a legal term to provide that the city council will have to pay the money in the future and if it does not, the county council has recourse to the same process as every citizen and organisation in the State to pursue the debt in the courts.  That is why that phrase is included.  Those two issues, which are legitimate concerns, were already addressed on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> Deputy Michael Collins referred to Blarney and Tower.  I am familiar with the views of many people in those areas.  I was not responsible for drawing the map.  If we start unpicking different parts of it now, the necessary boundary change would fall apart.  Blarney and Tower were included by the experts who were part of this group.  I refute the Deputy's reference to the local electoral boundaries in west County Cork.  I have received many emails from his constituents recently which indicate that his efforts have not fallen on deaf ears.  An independent commission is established with no politician, former politician or anyone connected to a political party on it.  It comprises statisticians, people from university political faculties and individuals with experience in local government.  The Minister gives them the job of drawing up boundaries.  They have made some decisions of which I cannot make head or tail.<\/p> <p> I come from a little parish of 2,000 on the border of Kilkenny and Wexford.  For the first time in the history of the State, at the next local election half of that parish will vote in the Thomastown electoral area in Kilkenny and the other half will vote in the electoral area we were always in, namely, that of Piltown.  I do not agree with that.  If my neighbours asked me to interfere with an independent process, I would have to inform them that I am not breaking the law.  I have to say the same to the Deputy.  I do not know the boundaries as intimately as he does and I have no doubt that there are legitimate concerns.  However, I will not interfere with the independent process to draw up the electoral boundaries in west County Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300028#EE00200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544712300,"counter":376,"content":"<p>The Minister of State might clarify an issue of geography when he responds.

Cork is the biggest county in Ireland.  As a result of Cork's geographic size, there was good reason to have two administrative bodies.  As the Minister of State is aware, the exact opposite view was taken on the second biggest county in Ireland, namely, Galway.  Unfortunately, or perhaps quite smartly, the Long Title of the Bill includes reference to the chief executive of Galway.  This meant that amendments, including amendment No. 34, could not be debated on Report Stage.  There is significant concern that while there is clarity on the compensation package for Cork City Council and Cork County Council, this is not the case regarding Galway, where there are significant financial concerns which have been highlighted to the Minister of State.  This issue has been ongoing for a number of years.  If it is moved to a unified local authority without addressing the fundamental issues of representation - remember this is the second biggest county in Ireland - and more importantly the issue of funding, this project will come a cropper.  While the legislation outlines in great detail the provisions for Cork, it does not address the issues relating to Galway.  However, there is a definitive provision to the effect that there will be a single unified local authority because there will be a single chief executive to operate that.  That was the concern raised in the context of amendment No. 34.  It is important that the local authorities have clarification on access to resources which are critical for the functioning of both local authorities and a future single local authority in County Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300029#FF00600","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1544712300,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I have listened to the debate today and I listened to what was said on Committee Stage.

Neither the Department nor the Minister of State seems to have a clear single vision as to how local authorities should function.  The argument put forward for the extension of Cork city is an argument the Minister of State denied to Kilkenny city.  I challenged him on this previously.

We had a corporation - an urban council.  It struck its own rates and it was central to the economic development of the city and county.  We had one manager who was the city and county manager.  In the context of the description from local government, it may not have fitted that description of a council within the city, but at the same time there is a city and there are developments all around that city.  The borough boundary, as it was known then, should really be extended in the same way as is being done in Cork.  The city should not stand on its own but be part of the total administrative structure for the city and the county.<\/p>  <p>  While the Minister of State is making the argument for Cork in the way he is, he spoke against that very argument previously.  From what he is saying, it appears that there is no overall plan for the development of cities or urban centres and allowing them the recognition they deserve in the context of their population and growth.  That is what happening in Kilkenny and the reverse is happening in Cork.  The Minister of State refuses to deal not just with Kilkenny but with other similar centres.  Why is that the case?  Why did the Minister of State previously state that he was opposed to that notion?  In principle, he is now addressing the same thing in the context of Cork.  That does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Naughten stated, it does not make sense that there is no attempt to deal overall with not only the administration but also the boundaries and the election of public representatives.  No effort is being made to bring back a level of local democracy throughout the country.  The Minister of State spoke about the centre of cities being boarded up, etc.  However, as he drives through Kilkenny, surely he can also see that the nature of High Street has changed, and that small towns and villages have changed.  They need major investment to restore them to something like what they used to be while at the same time keeping up with modern developments and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The same question arises with planning.  When the planning authority was with Kilkenny Corporation - Kilkenny urban council - it had a direct input.  It was part of a membership of 12 and now it is part of a membership of 24.<\/p><p>The manner in which the Minister of State is bringing forward this Bill is not right.  It is an ill-thought out plan that will affect the whole country.  The Government should go back to the drawing board, back to all of the good things that were happening in local authorities and restore the democratic process at local level in every city, county and urban centre, acknowledging the current growth patterns and projections for future growth.  I encourage the Government to do that because as it weakens local democracy and it detaches the democratic process from the people.  As we have seen in France and other places around the world, when that happens there is disquiet because there is no way of influencing the shape of a local community, city or county.  The former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, divided a city in two before he left for Europe.  He introduced a whole new rural part to electoral areas.  It was impossible to administer and impossible for local public representatives to engage in a meaningful way with those who elected them.  I encourage the Minister of State to go back and look at this again and to learn from the mistakes of the past.  In that way, we can avoid making the same mistakes with Cork and Galway.  The Minister of State must listen to all of the stakeholders, particularly the local communities, in order to establish what they want.  We make decisions here and often exclude the most central stakeholders, namely the local communities and businesses.  The Minister of State must provide leadership on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300029#FF00900","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544712900,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I remind Deputies that while amendment No. 8 is focused on Cork, it is relevant to other areas around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300030#GG00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1544712900,"counter":386,"content":"<p>The Minister has said that all is well and that a strategic approach has been worked out but I will give an example of my concerns here.

An Bord Plean&aacute;la approved the plan.  The development was supposed to have a rail link but there is nothing in the national development plan about an extension spur off the Cork-Mallow railway line in order to provide sustainable transport.  There are plans to upgrade the road network, however, which will mean an additional 10,000 people driving into Cork from north of the city.  This is yet another example of the unsustainable planning that Cork has experienced for decades.  While I hear the Minister of State saying that there are new mechanisms in place to avoid the mistakes of the past, this project was approved only two years ago by An Bord Plean&aacute;la but the national development plan contains no provision for rail infrastructure.  Back in 2016, Monard was part of the county area and was celebrating this as a win over the city.  This type of thing is still going on.<\/p><p>The Minister of State said that he agreed with the arguments I made but did not explain why he could not accept my amendment.

I was listening to the councillors and that is why I tabled an amendment here.  I want to stop this from going ahead because the councillors, from Fine Gael and from all parties and none, are telling us that this is not going to work and that it represents a bad deal for the county of Cork.  Nobody listened to the councillors and as the Minister of State said, nobody listened to me in this House either.  Sadly, no-one from Cork listened to me in here.  Deputies from Galway, Kerry, Tipperary and Dublin supported me but no-one from Cork supported me because the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of a certain political party wag the tail.  We are now left to pick up the pieces here.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that there is no guarantee that the Department will pay going forward if the city is unable to pay.  The only action that will be possible is to take the matter to court.  Cork county could be facing the terrible situation of getting involved in a massive court case against the city.  It is quite possible that will happen.  The redrawing of the map to include Blarney and Tower is just another example of collar and tie pencil pushers drawing maps without consulting people.  The Minister of State referred to the local authority and spoke about people with university experience but nobody has more experience than the people on the ground.

The Minister of State has said that he does not want to interfere but he is entitled to do so.  He can choose not to accept the recommendation that will result in the people of Ring, Timoleague, Courtmacsherry, Darrara and Lislevane being taken out of an electoral area in which they want to remain.

The Bill refers only to the appointment of a single chief executive, which was the situation in Galway until the mid 1980s.  Indeed, as Deputy McGuinness outlined, the same situation existed in Kilkenny until much later.  We are still retaining two separate corporate bodies.  That is why the issues relating to Cork in terms of compensatory packages are for the Galway Bill, which will be brought before the House in the middle of 2019.  The next local government Bill will be primarily concerned with the merger of the two Galway authorities but the provisions in this Bill are not concerned with that.

I do not accept at all the arguments put forward by Deputy McGuinness and others about inconsistency.  The issue here is that in Kilkenny there are 100,000 people and it is perfectly reasonable to think that we should have one local authority there.  Deputy McGuinness believes that people in Kilkenny city should have two ballot papers whereas I believe that everyone in County Kilkenny should get one ballot paper in a local election.

As I said on Committee Stage, this suggests to me that if in the areas where a plebiscite for a directly elected mayor is held and the public decide they did not want a directly elected mayor, the Minister could proceed with the report for a law providing for a directly elected mayor and, conversely, paragraph (b) also refers to &quot;a report specifying the reasons for his or her not preparing and submitting a report under paragraph&quot;, which means the Minister could effectively ignore a plebiscite.  If the public decide they want a directly elected mayor a future Minister could decide not to proceed with the their wish.  That is the reason my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and I have submitted an amendment to the effect that after &quot;Oireachtas&quot; we would insert &quot;in accordance with the result of the plebiscite&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300032#JJ00600","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544714400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.

I want to get clarity from the Minister of State on the issue.  He said in response to a previous amendment that a paper is going to the Cabinet on metropolitan governance.  The reason for my amendment is that I wanted to ensure there would be a draft Bill before people vote on a plebiscite so that they would know what the functions of a directly elected mayor would be, and that they would know how the directly elected mayor would interact with elected members, the executive and other bodies operating within the administrative area.  I do not understand why the amendment was ruled out of order.  I did not bring it up previously because I did not want to interrupt the flow of the debate on the Galway issue.

Not alone that, but the result of the plebiscite will require a Government decision to move to the stage of legislating to enact to provide for the position.  A plebiscite is different from a referendum by nature anyway.  Deputy O'Brien might be familiar with the referendum in 1979 to extend the franchise for the university constituencies in the Seanad but it was never enacted.  Since then, the legislation on holding referendums has been worded differently.  The plebiscites will require further Government action, and I might not be part of the Government.  I might be on the backbenches.  I am not in a position to tie the hands of a future Government decision.  I understand the point underlying Deputy O'Brien's amendment but I do not think it is feasible.  If the electorates in the four areas vote for a directly elected mayor, it will not be politically feasible for whoever is Minister at the time not to act upon that and to report within the two years, as is provided for in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy O'Sullivan, we discussed the matter at length on Committee Stage.  The next step in the process of holding the plebiscites will be a memo to be discussed and, hopefully, approved by the Cabinet in the new year on the exact functions of a directly elected mayor and what his or her relationship will be with councillors and the executive.  Before the memo goes to the Government, I committed to having a debate in this House and in the other House.  I do not care how long that takes.  I do not think there is any big difference of opinion.  My view is that we should give the maximum possible powers to a directly elected mayor, but that would exclude the hiring and firing powers and would exclude certain planning functions in relation to tribunals and inquiries we have had previously.  Before we produce a draft I am open to hearing the views of Members in both Houses and for people to have their say, subject to the agreement of the Business Committee of both Houses.  We get very little time for local government issues because it is not one of those obviously pertinent or important issues.  This is a substantial democratic question and I have no problem allowing as much time as is necessary for debates in both Houses in advance of the memo being prepared and discussed by the Cabinet.  Once it is discussed by the Cabinet then a decision will be made by the Government and the memo will be the basis of the question that is put to the people.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Brien is correct: we have explained in the course of the debate on the Bill, and in the amendments that have been accepted on Committee Stage, that the local authorities in question will be required not later than 30 days before the holding of a plebiscite to distribute the information on what the position is.  I would expect all the political parties to be knocking on people's doors at that stage for local and European elections at least, and referendums.  In some areas people will have five ballot papers, which is a lot, but that is a whole other question.  People will have time in advance to establish their party positions on the questions being asked and to campaign on the issues.  It is not an unreasonable suggestion.  I have nothing to do with the amendment being ruled out of order.  We will get to discuss the issue if the Business Committees agree.  There is no reason we cannot do it very early at the start of the new D&aacute;il term, because generally that is the time when a slot might be available for such a discussion on what kind of directly elected mayors we want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300033#KK00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1544714400,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I am not trying to tie anyone's hands but I am trying to make sure that the will of the people, as expressed in the plebiscite, is reflected in the reports made by any future Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said it would not be politically feasible for someone to ignore that.  I understand that a plebiscite is different from a referendum.  I agree that it is important that we specify that any report that is brought should be in accordance with the vote taken by the people in the plebiscite because at the moment absolute discretion is afforded to the Minister either to bring a report that proposes to bring forward and enact legislation for directly elected mayors or not to do so, regardless of the outcome of the vote.

On that basis I am more than happy to support the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to comment on the Minister of State's response to Deputy O'Sullivan.  The repeal referendum was preceded by a Citizens' Assembly, a special Oireachtas committee and the heads of a Bill.  A significant amount of work went into building the consensus so that when we were out campaigning on the referendum we had a clear sense of what the legislative framework would look like.  I am concerned that a Cabinet memo produced in a short period would not be of the same order.  We clearly said to the Minister of State at the Oireachtas committee that we are willing to work with him.  I am sure that is the case also for Deputies across the Chamber who are not on the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is probably a bit ambitious to think that early in the new year there could be consultation with the Members and that we would agree in principle the shape of the devolution the Minister of State is talking about to such an extent that whatever memo goes to or comes from the Cabinet would get the approval of all sides of the House.<\/p><p>As a result, we would be going into the plebiscites on a much less sure footing than we did in terms of the repeal referenda, when the heads of Bills had been published.  I urge caution.  Those of us spent a lot of time on the directly-elected mayoral fora in Dublin leading up to the non-plebiscite know how difficult it is to deal with this issue.  If there is not clarity in terms of the powers and functions of the directly-elected mayors, that makes winning or losing the plebiscites much more complicated.  I just want to throw that out as a caution.  While we are still happy to work with the Minister of State, I am not sure he is going to be able to do what he has outlined he wants to do in the short period in advance of those plebiscites if this amendment is passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300033#KK00500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544715000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I take the point the Minister of State is making regarding the fact there will be discussion in the chambers and so on.

A plebiscite is not about party politics, it is about people making up their own minds about what kind of local government system they want.  The functions of their directly-elected mayor will be very important in terms of people's perception of how they might vote.

If they are passed, I would absolutely intend to have directly-elected mayoral elections held within 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a lot of shilly-shallying on the issue, some of it for legitimate reasons and some not.  I want to move to a position where every local authority in the country has a directly-elected head.  It is all about rebalancing the relationship between the manager, as we used to call them in my day, and the chair.  Pending the Government decision, this will have no impact on the functions that are reserved for the councillors, and they would still have to approve development plans and budgets and would still be responsible for the distribution of funds in the municipal districts.  I am not talking about impacting on that relationship at all.  At the same time, we have this Victorian-type system in Ireland where too much power rests in an unelected official.  By and large, in the history of the State these officials have been very good people, but it is all about democratic control.

I thank the Minister of State for his engagement on this.  Most of us agreed with the concept.  It is a sizeable addition to the Bill at a late enough stage.  I believe the Minister of State also recognises that.  That was a particular concern which we discussed with my colleagues, Deputies Casey and Butler.  If there are reforms to local government we want to ensure that local authorities which share boundaries, particularly in urban areas,  work better together and that a better structure is put in place for that to happen.  For that to happen we also need to make sure there is full consultation.  As I said, we spent a great deal of time in the select committee debating this proposal and its merits.  The manner in which it was introduced at a late stage has posed some difficulties.  A lot needed to be teased out, particularly in the area of planning.  <\/p><p>The Bill as it stands would give power to these urban area committees to produce local area plans that would supersede county development plans and which would be transposed.  We debated this at length and discussed it with the Minister of State.  I know there is a willingness to ensure proper democratisation within this, to ensure there would be oversight by the local authorities and that unelected people would not be sitting and voting on these committees, and to deal with the area of proportionality.  This is also very important.  We should not have one large local authority telling another smaller local authority what to do.  There is a lot of merit in what the Minister of State brought to this Bill, though late in the game, but there are issues that need to be teased out.  There are concerns in particular about the eight areas that have been selected.  Colleagues of mine will discuss these concerns.  <\/p><p>All of us who spoke on Committee Stage, including myself, Deputies &Oacute; Broin, Casey and others, saw the merits in this concept and in ensuring local authorities work better together, particularly on the planning side, for the good of the citizens they serve and whom councillors represent.  However, we cannot have a democratic deficit either.  We need to make sure locally elected councillors are included in this process.  From a planning perspective, we also have to make sure that committees are not set up which will supersede well-planned and sequenced local area plans and development plans.  It is in that context that we tabled the amendments which seek to remove these sections.  <\/p><p>I know the Minister of State has indicated a willingness to return and look at how this could be done better by way of separate legislation.  That is a sensible approach.  I hope the amendments we have tabled will be supported and that we can look at this again more comprehensively by way of separate legislation.  I firmly believe that is what should have been done in the first place.  The concept of urban area committees was too fundamental to be introduced through a Committee Stage amendment.  We did our best to be constructive on this concept and to tease out the points on Committee Stage.  That will help the process into the future, but we have got to make sure the local authorities named in this Bill are also consulted and that the elected members on the ground are consulted.  We can come back next year with more comprehensive legislation that ensures committees like these are set up on a statutory basis in urban areas to deal with shared services, but we must consult properly and widely on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300036#NN00500","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1544715900,"counter":420,"content":"<p>While I know the Minister of State has trouble on his own patch, I suggest that if he wants a rerun of the Battle of the Boyne between Louth and Meath or between Drogheda and its hinterland, not to mention the Leinster senior football final of 2010-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300036#NN00600","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1544715900,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Louth was robbed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300036#NN00700","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1544715900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>To be fair to him, I believe Deputy Fitzpatrick, who was then Louth manager, described it as a case of Dick Turpin without a mask.

I cannot see any role in that proposal for the rest of the Drogheda councillors, the other members of Louth County Council, or the executive, including professional planning staff.

The community was very motivated on this.  The difficulty is that the boundary commission report that was completed set a bomb ticking in respect of the recommendation.  While it did not recommend that part of County Roscommon be amalgamated into County Westmeath, it did lay down a condition that, if co-operation across the River Shannon and the county boundary was not instituted within a four-year period, the incorporation of Monksland, County Roscommon, into County Westmeath would happen automatically.

The amendments brought in by the Minister of State on Committee Stage, which it is now proposed to delete, were brought in as a replacement for that ticking time bomb.<\/p><p> Local authority elections will take place within the next 23 months.  It is difficult to see progress being made on this.  While there always has been a willingness from the local authority members in the Athlone area to have a co-ordinated approach across the River Shannon, that has not been always the case across both local authorities.  A person, who is on, for the sake of argument, the Mayo county boundary, has equal influence regarding the development of Athlone as a person who is on the Cavan county boundary.  While the councillors locally were prepared to co-operate and work together, that was not always the case.  The objective behind the urban area committee was to ensure a structure underpinned that co-operation and it replaced the recommendation on page 49 of the boundary commission report, which has caused much concern locally in Athlone.  If that report remains in place, by the deletion of these particular sections, the co-operation that has been built up will be undermined and we will not see the progress that needs to be made. <\/p> <p>Many of us here agree on the objective set out in Project Ireland 2040 that Athlone develop as a new emerging city and in that way to provide a counter balance to some of the other growth areas across the country and to give the heartlands region an opportunity to bring employment into the middle of the country which has not been the case to date.  However, Athlone cannot develop without co-operation across the county boundary and the regional structures currently in place.  A statutory footing is required to ensure such co-operation happens in reality.  People would say that co-operation can happen anyway.  We have seen in the past that where such co-operation was on a statutory basis that one of those committees ended up breaking up in disarray.  While currently there is co-operation, it is on the basis that this would be put on a statutory footing.  <\/p> <p> I know I am a lone voice on this issue.  Discussions have been ongoing.  The key political parties are proposing that this would be put forward in separate legislation, but what happens to the recommendations on page 49 of the Athlone boundary report?  I was given assurances that sections 46 and 47 of this legislation superseded the recommendations in that report, but if these sections are being removed from this legislation, what is the status of those recommendations?  Are we back to a situation where a gun is being put to the heads of the councillors and officials in Roscommon County Council to co-operate or Monksland will be taken away?  That should not be the case.<\/p> <p> This legislation provides for equality of treatment regarding co-operation across boundaries.  If that issue of equality is recognised in law, much progress can be made regarding engagement, but that equality has never been there to date.  It has been always the case of one bigger local authority looking over the ditch at the other local authority.  The solution put forward by the Minister of State's officials, the previous Government, and the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, was to move the fence a little out and take in part of County Roscommon into County Westmeath.  That has been the simple solution up to now.  I am vehemently opposed to that, as are the people I represent in County Roscommon and the tens of thousands of people who signed that petition and got the support of every political party in this House at the time.  How stands the position of the people who signed those petitions and were given commitments that they would not be shoehorned into County Westmeath because of a lack of equality of treatment regarding engagement.  This legislation, these amendments and these sections were to provide that specific protection.  They were to ensure that the town of Athlone develops in a co-ordinated manner both in County Westmeath and in County Roscommon.  It was not to benefit either local authority or the local community but to benefit the region as a whole.  It was to attract people to the greater heartlands region, to bring investment into that region and to at long last provide a counter-balance to the investment which, historically, has taken place only on the edges of our island.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that for colleagues in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300036#NN01500","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544716500,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Like a number of colleagues, when these amendments were tabled late on Monday of last week, I was quite critical of them, given that they are substantive, that they propose significant changes to local government structures and powers, and that we were given them at such a late stage without adequate time for pre-legislative scrutiny or proper consideration.  I acknowledge, however, the response of the Minister and his officials.  He gave us a considerable amount of time last week, prior to Committee Stage, to go through this in detail.  We had a very full discussion on Committee Stage and another detailed discussion with a number of members of the joint committee and others this week.  While we are proposing the removal of Part 7 through these amendments, it is not because we do not accept the core principle behind what the Minister is seeking to do.  Both on Committee Stage and in the subsequent discussion, all of us accepted that the intention behind the Minister's amendments is right.  We have pledged to work with him on the separate legislation, which we believe can be done quite early next year, either attached to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill or in stand-alone legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address some of Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s concerns because he has not been privy to our considerations.  His questions were directed to the Minister of State but to ensure he knows where we stand on that, and my comments will be reflective of those of many Opposition Deputies, we absolutely accept that in those 11 urban areas in particular which now cross county boundaries, we have to have a statutory requirement for a comprehensive plan and this has to involve elected members from that particular area.  Leaving it to the voluntary co-operation of the local authorities will not work.  It has not worked in the past, and there are many examples of that.  Our concern was not that we did not want a statutory mechanism for doing this but that, given that we did not have adequate time to scrutinise the proposals and that there had not been in our view adequate consultation with elected members, sitting county managers or elected Members here, more time was required to get it right.<\/p>  <p>  If it is any reassurance to Deputy Naughten, there is a commitment on the part of all the Opposition members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, where this will rest next year to get this done in advance of the local government elections, to provide for a statutory mechanism to do the very thing he is requiring.  We had detailed informal discussions and I understand the Minister and his officials were very receptive to ways of improving what is in the Bill to ensure we get it right.  Nobody is arguing this should not be done before the local elections.  Nobody is arguing for the blocking of the statutory requirement.  It is simply about ensuring it is done correctly.  There is a case for removing it now and returning to it very early next year  We would more than welcome the input of those Deputies who are not members of our committee but who have a significant interest in this to ensure we get it right.  In that way, when members are elected, and approximately 23 local authorities will be affected by this measure, they will understand clearly that there will be a statutory requirement for such a plan and a mechanism that puts it in place.<\/p>  <p>  One of the concerns many of us had was that while it is right and proper to have a statutory requirement for such a plan and a mechanism for co-ordination among councillors across two local authorities, we must ensure also that, for example, all elected members within the municipal districts affected by these plans get input into it.  That is not provided for in the original proposal from the Minister.  It is important that all members of those municipal districts would get a final say.  The exact mechanisms have to be teased out.  It is important that the way those elected members are appointed to any such committee in the future, how decisions are made in terms of the boundary that committee would examine, the specific nature of public consultation and involvement of different sectors of the community, including the community sector, which is not included in this Bill, would be properly taken into account.<\/p><p>Deputies Casey and O'Brien and I were clear at the Select Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government meeting that we want something that does what this intends to do.  We think there is a much better way to do it.  The Minister of State is meeting us halfway, which, to my understanding, is why he will accept amendments Nos. 20, 21, 31 and 32.  We will make sure as much time is provided as is needed early next year by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to facilitate the Minister, his officials and Deputies from all the affected areas who are not members so that we have it in place before the local elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300037#OO00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544717100,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I welcome that the Minister of State will withdraw his amendments, which I believe are unworkable, and accept Opposition amendments.  Using the example of Waterford and Kilkenny where the difficulties thrown up by boundary issues have been high profile in recent weeks, what was proposed in early stages would not work.  The metropolitan area of Waterford city has a population of 47,000.  The Ferrybank area of south Kilkenny has a population of 5,000.  They were going to be represented by three councillors each, the chief executive of each local authority and four other people.  This would have been difficult from the point of view of democracy and proportional representation.  The proposed powers and functions up for consideration beggared belief, including the proposal that the local area plan could be overruled.  It sent shockwaves through the local authorities, councillors and people affected.  It generated a lot of mileage on the national and local airwaves, as one can imagine.  I do not believe what was proposed is the correct solution for a collaborative approach going forward, but I believe we have to have an approach where local authorities can come together and work for the betterment of all the people who live in an area that straddles two different counties or districts. The proposal in its current form would only deepen the divide and drive a deeper wedge between both communities.  That is the last thing we want.  In practical terms, I do not know how this would have worked but I welcome that common sense has prevailed for now and that we will revisit this in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121300038#PP00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1544717100,"counter":434,"content":"<p>This is an important discussion, even on this Stage of the Bill.  I offer my sympathies to the Minister of State who is attempting to solve a problem which is a lively issue in my constituency.  I concur with much of what Deputy Naughten said.  I will give a factual example to show how unworkable what has been proposed is.  Drogheda is in County Louth at the moment but a significant part of the town of Drogheda is in County Meath.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, states the town of Drogheda has a population of 42,000, which makes it the largest town in the country.  It is not too far behind Waterford, which has approximately 52,000 to 53,000 people.  We do not have a council.  We have a significant development in east Meath, which is important to the town and to everybody.  In an attempt to deal with this issue, both Louth and Meath county councils produced an area development plan for the areas that we are talking about.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that the professional plan had buy-in from both councils, the district council in Meath overturned that and the law was that the local council had priority.  The plan, which was appropriate and proper for the area, agreed by both councils, was overruled, and a builder's charter came into force instead.  Hundreds of houses were built.  They did not have planning permission at the time.  We also had fights over where a certain football ground might go.  We had rezoning of land which was going to be zoned for housing in one plan and not in another plan.  There were stories of land valued at potentially millions of euro coming and going, toing and froing - not by Deputy Breathnach.  That was the cynical operation that was being done at the back of all this.  Out of that came things like out of town shopping centres.  We all know that out of town shopping centres have destroyed the urban fabric and heart of our towns.  There were out of town shopping centres outside Drogheda, in County Meath, given permission because Meath then gets the rates income.  All of that codology has gone on for years, and not just in Drogheda but everywhere else as well.<\/p>  <p>  It is time to put a stop to a council taking a significant advantage of a large adjoining population and putting in items which give it an income but destroy the fabric of the other town.  It is also time that we put an end to a developer who was granted extensive planning permission on a condition from An Bord Plean&aacute;la that first and foremost the road network and roundabouts to manage traffic would have to go in.  As it happened, the houses were built with no damned roundabouts and people had to wait for years before they were put in place.  That is another joke.  Sewage was moved at night from a storage tank because the houses were occupied before proper planning permission was put in place.  All that codology happened and continues to happen in counties Louth and Meath.  People are arguing on both sides.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State that there has to be a proper order and a hierarchy of plans.  I agree with the hierarchy of having the county councils make the plans.  There must be significant local input and it must be balanced but what the Minister of State was, and is still, trying to do is to balance that.  The voice of the people in the case I am talking about was the last voice to be heard.  The voice of the developers was heard and that is why we ended up with some of the disgraceful situations that people have to live with.  Houses were built with no facilities, infrastructures or anything but the profit the builder made was in his back pocket.  He then walked away and left houses, which in some cases he kindly built on flood plains.  We know all about that around the country.  We want proper, properly controlled planning, with the interests of the local people being paramount.  Even though I am critical of parts of the councils' plans, they are generally excellent, and that is the appropriate place to draft them.<\/p>  <p>  Whether one has a Meath or a Louth jersey, if one wants to go to a decent school in Drogheda or east Meath or to go to a shopping centre, one has a choice.  Infrastructure, recreational facilities and amenities have to be properly planned.  There is a demand in Drogheda for my town to be in control of its own destiny and to have its own council with full, proper powers.  It is unacceptable to me and the citizens of my town that we have a population greater than the wonderful county of Longford, whom I wish well, and Leitrim.  They have their infrastructure, their chief executive officers, planners, engineers and everything except the population that we have.  We have absolutely nothing.  That creates a significant political crisis in our area.  I know Deputy Breathnach knows it well, fair dues to him.  He should have been there this morning, though he can text me about that.<\/p>  <p>  There is room for deep thought on this and significant collaboration among all of us for the best planning.  We must put an end to cowboy plans and cowboys, and to councillors who do not act in the best interest of the public.  We have evidence of that today from a Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, judgment.<\/p><p>We cannot and must not allow a coach and four to be driven through our planning system by people with pecuniary interests and no concern for future generations or planning.

Dick Turpin was also mentioned.  I want to deal with matters that are much less contentious and much more civilised.  Waterford-Kilkenny is one example of an area that would have been subject to the proposed urban area councils.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, for his co-operation in working with the Opposition on this issue.  As stated earlier by Teachta &Oacute; Broin, we had concerns about elements of what is being proposed in terms of the composition of the committees, the powers and functions of the committees and the lack of clarity around how they would interact in a democratic way with the councils and the metropolitan districts.  We also had a difficulty with the democratic deficit which we believed would have been created in what would be the urban area of the metropolitan area of Waterford and the part of south Kilkenny which would allow for the natural expansion of Waterford city, which the Minister of State will be aware crosses the county boundaries of Waterford and Kilkenny.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time, we have all-party support to work to identify a process to address this issue, which is positive and important.  People have their views on boundary extensions but if, as the Minister of State said boundary extensions are on hold, we now need to look at putting in place processes that will work.  Sinn F&eacute;in has no difficulty with supporting a process or a structure but I agree with Teachta Naughten that it would have to be on a statutory basis.  We would then have to examine the relationship between whatever structure is put in place and the local authorities it would straddle.  We must get this right.  We also have to have maximum consultation on the issue because we have all been contacted by CEOs of councils, councillors and others, expressing genuine concerns.   Everybody wants to make sure we get this right and that we have an appropriate process.  What I am hearing from people at management and council level in the more than dozen local authorities affected is that they want a fair and democratic process, one that practically will work and will deliver for people in those areas.<\/p>  <p>  If we can take the heat and the emotion out of this issue and deal with it in a practical and sensible way, we can find a solution that is appropriate for everybody, especially the people who live in the areas.  I thank the Minister of State for accepting the amendments.  Teachta &Oacute; Broin and I, and hopefully others, will work constructively with the Minister of State to ensure we put in place a process.  Nobody is saying that we can leave things as they are because that is not sustainable.  Everybody accepts that there has to be a solution.

In Limerick, it is different in that only a relatively small number of houses and a piece of the university are in County Clare.  We have not had the kind of larger development described in regard to Waterford-Kilkenny and Athlone.  Deputy Casey gave us a lot of information about Bray.  There is the potential for this abuse to occur in the Limerick-Clare situation because the new road will open up a currently undeveloped rural area and so I can understand why this provision would be needed into the future.

My concern is in regard to the removal of the democratic process.  For example, if I am one of the eight councillors elected to Bray County Council but not one of the three elected to the committee I would have no democratic say in how my local area plan is adopted.  I also agree with Deputy Naughten's remarks in regard to proportionality.  Regardless of what structure is put in place, finding a balanced solution will be difficult.  This piece is missing form the debate.  We have discussed with the Minister of State the idea of the municipal districts or the wards being the bodies that would sign off on plans rather than a select committee of eight people.  We have offered solutions in our contributions today, which I believe the Minister of State will take on board.<\/p>  <p>  We also have concerns regarding the make-up of the committees, in particular the appointment of four outsiders to the committee, although I understand they would not have voting rights.  Currently, local areas plans, county plans and regional plans are adopted without outside involvement.  There is no need for such people to be members of the committee because we could always call on them if we needed them.  The issue of sequencing is also of concern.  This issue has been driven by the national planning framework in regard to the regional plans, the county plans and the local area plans but in this instance, the sequencing is reversed, coming from the ground upwards.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il, and I am sure everybody in this House, is willing to work with the Minister of State to resolve this issue and to give him time to consider it.

Having listened to the Committee Stage debate, I was conscious of the fact that what was proposed, particularly with regard to the local area plan, was a big change and that we should have more time for consideration.  I was also conscious of the fact that nobody disagrees with the idea that we must have a joint structure for towns and cities that cross county boundaries.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane regarding his desire to take the heat out of the issue we are most familiar with in our part of the world.  I will not refer to Dick Turpin or anybody else in that regard.<\/p><p>Deputy Casey is right that the central thesis here is not going to be universally accepted even in the new year.  I have told the assistant secretary in the Department that rather than eating turkey later this month, he will be drafting the relevant sections for a new short legislative measure specifically relating to urban area committees.  It will refer to the structure and also the functions.  There will not be universal agreement.  The <i>status quo<\/i>has to change, as everybody says, but it will only change if there is acceptance on every side of these boundary areas that powers that reside with existing councils will have to be given up.  There will be no fudging our ability to square that circle - powers will have to be given up.<\/p><p>Deputy Naughten said he is a lone voice but, as he probably realises from listening to some of the other contributions, he is not.  I assure him that his is not a lone voice.  He raised specific issues about the status of recommendations in the boundary report relating to Roscommon.  Those recommendations are in no way binding on me or my successors.  They are recommendations for action.  I understand the desire on all sides of the question in Athlone for a solution to be devised.  That is why as early as possible in the new year the staff in the Customs House and in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel will be drafting.  There is largely agreement on the necessity for them to exist.<\/p><p>I am a believer in another point the Deputy made.  The principle here is equality between the authorities that are devising plans of whatever status for the areas concerned.  Unless that equality exists, these structures will be doomed before they come into place.  Whether I use my example or other others from around the country, if there are committees in which there are eight members from one county and two from another, then, as sure as eggs, we know what the outcome will be.  I accept Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's point that one size does not fit all.  That is why in the functions part of the new legislation we will be discussing quite high-level pieces relating to development of these urban centres into the future.  These are pieces that local authorities often do not do very well, such as the spatial planning for what should be in the Clare part of Limerick city in the future as well the areas the Deputy mentioned that will be opened up for development.<\/p><p>In my part of the country, most of the natural development of Waterford city will be on the north side of the Suir.  I will absolutely maintain my position that a county councillor, albeit from the same county but who lives 50 or 100 miles away, should not have an input into a decision that might affect another councillor who lives ten yards away on the wrong side of the boundary.  Currently, that person is excluded.  Deputy Cullinane's point is correct.  In the Waterford context the 18 metropolitan councillors in the Waterford city area should have the say, but the councillors living in Castlecomer and in Tallow should not have the say.  Waterford city is the local town for a third of the people who live in County Kilkenny, not just the 7,000 who live in the Ferrybank area, and there will be many more living there over the next few years.  Deputy O'Dowd also made that point about people living 50 miles away making the decisions as opposed to those who are representing, and living in, the area.  He described it as codology.  The purpose of the amendments as drafted was specifically to avoid the type of codology whereby voluntary groups would come together and draw up a plan which both sides could walk away from afterwards.  Regardless of the shape it takes in the new year, that will not be contained in the Bill.  This is where the democracy element Deputy Butler mentioned is paramount.  The councillors from those parts of the counties in question should have the final ratification.  I have very much come to that view, but that must be borne out in the drafting.  I have read all the reports by the local authorities that made submissions to the four boundary committees.  The central argument in favour of boundary extensions was always that the local authority needed an area included to properly plan and develop into the future.  That is a substantive argument and that is what this structure will have to do in those areas.<\/p><p>I am accepting amendments Nos. 20, 21, 31 and 32 the effect of which is to remove Part 7 of the Bill.

Members' colleagues throughout the country - the CEOs, councillors, council candidates and colleagues in this House - will be opposed to whatever alternative is brought forward.  We need urban area committees across boundaries and they must be placed on a statutory footing.  I am very supportive of co-operation, but co-operation cannot happen unless it is set out in law.
