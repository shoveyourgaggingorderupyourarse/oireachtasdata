It provides us with important ecosystem services such as food, pollination, soil fertility, water and climate regulation.  Globally, these services have been valued at approximately &euro;1.3 trillion annually.  However, national, regional and global assessments have all demonstrated ongoing declines in biodiversity.  Globally, we are degrading our natural assets by up to &euro;19 trillion annually.  The D&aacute;il has recognised the biodiversity crisis by declaring a biodiversity emergency in 2019.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 How has the world responded to this crisis?  At a global level, we have the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which is the sister convention to the climate change convention and both conventions were adopted in Rio in 1992.  All the countries in the world are parties to this convention, apart from the United States and the Vatican.  Decisions are made by the Conference of the Parties, or COP.  The three objectives of the convention are the conservation of biodiversity; the sustainable use of its components, which recognises that we are part of the living fabric and need to use it to exist; and that any benefits arising will be shared equitably.<\/p> <p>  The  National Parks and Wildlife Service acts as the focal point for this convention.  I am the focal point for the scientific subsidiary body to the convention.  The convention is underpinned by a strategic plan and 20 global biodiversity targets, which were due to run out in 2020.  A new global biodiversity framework is being negotiated.  It was due to be adopted at COP15 in China in 2020 but due to the ongoing Covid situation, the convening of COP15 has been delayed and is likely to take place in quarter 4 of this year, with the venue still to be confirmed.  The European Union is also a party to the convention.  For this reason, all of the negotiations at COP are co-ordinated at an EU level to present a strong EU and member state position.  The Czech Republic will facilitate EU negotiations at COP15 as it will hold the EU Presidency in the second half of 2022.<\/p> <p>  Several drafting groups have been set up to work on EU positions, which are agreed by member states at the EU Council working party on international environmental issues.  Council conclusions currently being prepared detail the high-level EU position on the preparations for COP15.  We will circulate Council conclusions to our colleagues across government for comment.<\/p> <p>  Under the draft global biodiversity framework, there are currently four goals and 21 targets being negotiated.\u00a0 These targets include protected area targets; restoration targets; targets for biodiversity-inclusive spatial planning; targets to reduce pollution and invasive alien species; targets to minimise the impact of climate change on biodiversity; targets for sustainable use and the elimination of incentives harmful to biodiversity; targets for business to move towards sustainable extraction and production practices; and, interestingly, a target to encourage and enable people to make responsible choices.  If we tackle overconsumption, the knock-on consequences will be significant.<\/p> <p>  In June, there will be another round of global negotiations in Nairobi to ensure the global biodiversity framework is sufficiently advanced for adoption at COP15 later this year.\u00a0 The Department of Foreign Affairs has provided &euro;100,000 to support the running costs of this very important meeting in June.<\/p> <p>  The convention is underpinned by several programmes of work that cover agriculture; inland water; marine and coastal; and forest biodiversity.  There are also many cross-cutting areas of work, including climate change, sustainable use, invasive alien species and protected areas.<\/p> <p>  EU policy and legislation have both informed and been informed by the global agenda.  The stage has already been set for the EU ambition for the global biodiversity framework with the publication of the EU biodiversity strategy in 2020.  The strategy for 2030 is part of the European Green Deal and is very ambitious.  First, the ambition is to have at least 30% of EU land and 30% of EU sea in a protected area network.\u00a0 The EU is due to publish legislation for legally binding restoration targets under the nature restoration law, which will include actions that will need to be implemented across many sectors, particularly agriculture, forestry and fisheries.  The stark reality is that we need to restore thousands of square kilometres of terrestrial land.\u00a0 There is also an ambition in the EU biodiversity strategy to halt and reverse the decline of pollinators, reduce the use and harmfulness of pesticides and restore freshwater ecosystems, including 25,000 km of free-flowing rivers across the EU.<\/p> <p>  A whole-of-government approach will be required in relation to the nature restoration law.  The nature restoration law proposal and the national restoration plan have significant implications for a range of business units in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other Departments, most notably the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environment, Climate and Communications.  There may need to be consultation and-or co-ordination with other member states on specific sectoral aspects of this proposal.  These will need to be co-ordinated across government and will feed back into the overall national policy positioning.<\/p> <p>  All of these new and emerging policy areas need to be folded into the next and fourth national biodiversity action plan, which is being drafted.  We have had many rounds of stakeholder engagement, including our recent national biodiversity conference attended by over 600 delegates.\u00a0 We hope to have the plan published in early 2023 to ensure that we consider the recommendations that arise from the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss.<\/p> <p>  Last week, at Ireland's second biodiversity conference, the Taoiseach said that biodiversity loss \"will only be successfully tackled as an all-of-Government and all-of-society project, which will require the vigilance of planners, local authorities, agricultural advisers and all manifestations of state who have a hand in regulating interventions in our land, rivers, lakes, seas and air.\"  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, with the support of the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, is working hard with colleagues across government and society to act now for nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lynn for her opening statement.

Does Dr. Lynn envisage that its role will change in the time ahead?<\/p> <p>  On 2 June, this committee heard from the European Commissioner for Energy.  There is a clear stated policy to fast-track planning for renewables projects and perhaps there is a rationale for doing so.

I have been working in the service for almost 20 years.  It has been a long time coming.  There will be an injection of 60 staff.  Many of them will backfill positions we lost since about 2008.  When considering biodiversity, it is important to look at responsibilities across Government and see where we can increase resources and capacity across Government to tackle this very wide-reaching agenda.  The biodiversity agenda touches almost every Department.  We need good education in schools and universities.  We need to address the crossover between biodiversity and health.  Obviously, biodiversity greatly supports the climate agenda.  Biodiversity meets adaptation measures.  It is a front-line defence against climate change with the ability for natural systems to sequester carbon and regulate water supply at times of heavy rainfall. I reiterate that we need to look at responsibilities across Government.  We also need to look at the internal structures in the NPWS to ensure that we are delivering on our legal responsibilities, particularly regarding European legislation.  That exercise still needs to take place.  We need to look across our structures and see where we need to inject additional resources.<\/p> <p>  I understand that we need to embrace renewable energy as part of achieving our climate goals.  However, we still need to adhere to legislation that is in place.  Those principles still apply.

Hopefully, the next round of river basin management planning will address many of these issues and will be able to scale up its programme of measures for our fresh waters.  In the context of biodiversity in some areas, we need even higher water quality than is required by the broader framework directive.  In some areas we will need to focus our efforts to ensure that we retain some of our really precious habitats, particularly some of our marl lakes and also some of our species that require very clean water, especially freshwater pearl mussel.  We certainly have considerable work ahead of us to ensure we continue to improve the condition of our freshwater systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lynn for her opening statement.  I return to a very worthy point raised by Deputy O'Rourke about river basin management.  Dr. Lynn has responsibility for a section within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Resourcing of our local authorities in the context of river basin management is major concern.  This goes beyond the point Deputy O'Rourke made regarding the general capacity of our local authorities, including mine, Fingal County Council.  In Swords, the Ward river valley, which feeds directly into the Broadmeadow Estuary SAC, is of serious concern to me.  The State seems to be heavily reliant on volunteerism.  While that might be great and some wonderful people do some wonderful work, I have concerns about the Department's and local authorities' ability to manage our river basin areas appropriately.  It also has a significant knock-on effect on water quality.  The ability of flora and fauna to thrive in such areas is stymied by waste litter and other issues.  I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising that matter.<\/p> <p>  My other points about the Department and the NPWS relate to comments Dr. Lynn made about targets.  I refer to building regulations and the clearance of natural habitats, including hedgerows, mature and even semi-mature trees for the purposes of development.  In many other countries, I am thinking specifically of Denmark, local authorities work with developers in order to retain such flora and fauna as part of developments and tend to integrate them into any development taking place.  My experience in Swords and Dublin 15, which is the fastest-growing community in Europe, would be that they simply clear fields and build away.  I also have slight concerns that our green spaces are grass only with perhaps a few trees here and there.  The State needs to step up and put in flower beds, bushes and perennial flowers to enhance the biodiversity of a local community. <\/p> <p>  My other two questions are related to building regulation.  Regarding sustainable development of our housing stock, we have an over-reliance on concrete.  There are regulation issues relating to the use of timber, structural or otherwise.  I would like to hear Dr. Lynn's comments on that.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on the eradication of fossil fuel heating sources in A-rated and B-rated homes.  I recently visited a new housing estate in my constituency and was delighted to see that the houses were A2-rated, including things I would like to see becoming normalised such as electric vehicle charging ports and communal spaces.  However, I was very concerned that they had gas boilers.  This is something Senator Higgins has referred to on many occasions in the committee in the last couple of years.  We are building in something with a lifespan of 20 or 30 years beyond our 2030 and 2050 targets.  I am concerned that we are unnecessarily reliant on fossil fuels for high-energy-rated properties.  We are building in the future use of fossil fuels for the purposes of home heating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#C00500","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Deputy Farrell-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#C00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I know the UK is set to ban the installation after 2030.

I am not familiar with many of the building regulations.  We are building up capacity within the local authorities with regard to biodiversity officers.  We hope to roll out biodiversity officers across all local authorities in the coming years.  I think there are only five biodiversity officers at the moment.  Hans Visser is the biodiversity officer in Fingal County Council, which recently published a biodiversity plan.  Mr. Visser noted that the council only has funding for a portion of the actions it needs to take so we need to look at our resourcing to make sure biodiversity action is undertaken at the local level.  We provide some funding to biodiversity and heritage officers but we need to look to all areas to pull in that funding to make sure we take on board local action.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned green spaces.  Many local authorities are embracing the all-island pollinator plan.  My preference would be to appreciate that we have amenity spaces.  Obviously, we have spaces where the youth are playing football or Gaelic games but there should also be areas where there is space for nature.  They do not need to have massive seed mixes from God knows where.  They can just be left.  We do not need to have everything so neat and tidy.  That is what I would really like to see.  I would like to see our communities functioning for different purposes.  It is not that I want everything necessarily to be complete wilderness but there should be those little corners and spaces within our urban environments where nature is allowed to thrive.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities have built up resources relating to climate action.  There are climate action regional offices.  It would be great to see more of a focus on biodiversity even within the climate agenda.  All local authority staff have had mandatory training relating to climate change.  I think they all had about an hour and half of such training.  I believe there may be moves to try to develop a similar programme for biodiversity and water.  Making sure staff in local authorities really understand the issues and solutions they produce for biodiversity at local level would be really excellent.  I look forward to seeing this rolled out in the coming years.  <\/p> <p>  I recently purchased a home with a BER of A3, which involves air to heat.  We are now seeing financial institutions and companies starting to green their portfolios.  I managed to get a really good interest rate based on my BER.  It is encouraging that financial institutions are also trying to green their portfolios.  There is an EU taxonomy regulation and there will be a dedicated act for biodiversity that should be signed off within the coming year.  A lot of these financial institutions would have to make disclosures relating to directions for biodiversity so that is very encouraging.  A lot is happening at EU level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Is there a political aspect to the work of the various Departments in terms of the comments for COP 15 that are being prepared, other than presumably the Department of Foreign Affairs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#D00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Is there a political aspect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Would any line committee such as those dealing with climate action, foreign affairs, etc., have an opportunity to assess the proposed comments that will be prepared for COP15?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#D00500","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>We are working on the Council conclusions, which is the high-level overview of the preparations for COP15.

I do not know whether other people struggle the way I do with the enormity of the challenge facing us.  In terms of mobilising people, if people feel a bit overwhelmed - it involves climate, pollution, species, extraction, farm methods and consumer choices, etc. - it all becomes a bit overwhelming for them.  Are there ways in which we can make it more concrete for Irish people as to what the ambition is?  If it is broken into so many silos, it is hard to mobilise people.  There is goodwill out there and you see people rewilding bits of their gardens.  They do not know to what extent that contributes.  Is it vitally important compared to being more sensitive in respect of what they buy in the supermarket versus buying an electric vehicle?  Does Dr. Lynn think that the advent of circular economy legislation, the attempt to look at sectors as a whole, redesigning the way we deliver various services and scrutinising the materials, methodologies and consumer choices constitute a way of bringing this into one programme in which consumers and the food sector can participate?  I am a bit overwhelmed by all the silos and the different inspectors and many ordinary people, particularly businesspeople, will feel that way.<\/p> <p>  How do we plan to mobilise change?  Dr. Lynn seems to say that we are going to sign up to a lot of ambitions but she does not seem to know what the policy tools that will be used to implement them will be.  I know this is a biodiversity emergency and we have to set targets but to some degree, that is reversing the usual approach of policy where you have a fair idea of what your policy instruments can deliver, and then you set a stretch target relating to whatever instruments you are going to put into the field.  Perhaps I am wrong but we seem to be doing it in reverse.  We are signing up to the targets and then wondering whether there will be policy tools to get us there.  It comes down to whether we are evolving the toolbox of funding streams, incentives, levies - whatever it is.  This is what is missing in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#D00700","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>They are very interesting questions.  Regarding being overwhelmed, I am often overwhelmed by the sheer number of things we should be working on to address the climate and biodiversity crisis.  In terms of trying to break it down for people, it is very important that we engage local communities.  There is an appetite out there among local communities.  They are willing to get involved.  Once they are talking about it at local level, they stop feeling powerless.  We are working with the Community Foundation for Ireland.  We have co-funded some of its work under its environment and nature fund.  This is to link up communities with ecologists to help communities to develop their own local community plans for biodiversity.  About 117 of these community plans are being drafted.  The next stage is for us to put some funding into implementing some of the measures associated with these plans.<\/p><p> On some of the other elements to do with the circular economy, the next generation is quite versed in this.  I have a six-year-old daughter and she is already coming to me and commenting on recycling and turning off the taps.  It is definitely sinking in for that generation.<\/p><p> With regard to how we plan to mobilise change and whether we are signing up to targets without having the means of implementation, the EU biodiversity strategy states we should use existing instruments to achieve the targets.  This is where we really need to look at how we spend our money.  A few years ago, I commissioned UCD to undertake research on biodiversity expenditure across government.  The results show that approximately 10% of funding for biodiversity comes through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Approximately 78% goes through the Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This is where we need to focus.  We need to look at how the money is spent and whether it is being spent effectively.  There is a move towards more results-based approaches.  We are using a lot of EU funding through the LIFE programmes to test and pilot work which is farmer led.  We state what we want the habitat to look like and that when it does we will provide the payments.  It is results based.  We are looking to scale up a lot of this work.<\/p><p> The amount needed for restoration is significant.  We need to look at private investment to support the restoration agenda.  We are exploring this.  We have set up the peatland finance Ireland initiative which will look at how we will be able to mobilise private finance for peatland restoration in particular.  Many private companies are very interested in getting involved in the restoration agenda.  We need to build the mechanisms.  We need to make sure we have a code so that everything is transparent and what we do is scientifically underpinned.

My first question is on the European Green Deal and the ambitious target of protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030.  We have signed up to this on a global and European level but my understanding is that we have not signed up to it at national level.  Does that need to happen?  Will it be included in the upcoming biodiversity action plan?  Is it being looked at?  Unless the targets are set, it will be very difficult to achieve.<\/p> <p>  I would like to know more about the 10% that is highly protected.  There is 30% protected and 10% highly protected.  The next aspect I want to discuss comes back to targets.  The committee has been through setting targets for climate emissions on a legislative basis.  Would it be a good idea to have something similar for biodiversity?  If it is not in legislation, it is more difficult to get it through, particularly for future Governments.  We do not know what will happen down the road.<\/p> <p>  The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, fund was expanded recently to include biodiversity measures.  There is a considerable amount of money in the fund and it tends to be used for climate emission measures.

The targets set in the EU biodiversity strategy are the targets set for EU levels.  It is 30% of EU land and 30% of EU sea.  This does not necessarily translate to the national level.  We will need to discuss internally in the National Parks and Wildlife Service how we tackle it.  A lot of work is being done on marine protected areas.  I hope we will expand the coverage of our marine protected areas considerably.  We will also need to have a lot of discussions about terrestrial land.  The Deputy may be familiar with some of the EU protected areas.  There are special areas of conservation and special protection areas for birds.  It does not need to be that level of protection.  We can have other systems.  We can have contract agreements for example.  We could enter into contract agreements with Bord na M&oacute;na and other public landowners.  There are other effective conservation measures.  There are other areas where we could say we are doing X, Y and Z and, therefore, technically we can include it in our figures.  We have to work out a lot of this.  We have to start making the pledges that will be examined in 2023.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the 10% that is supposedly strictly protected, these are carbon-rich ecosystems.  This means no activity should take place in these areas unless specifically for the conservation of the habitats on the site.  We will look at some of our carbon-rich habitats and bog areas and possibly salt marshes.  There are some other areas that would be quite carbon rich that we should consider for strict protection.<\/p> <p>  With regard to targets in legislation, we have our national biodiversity plan.  We are trying to get some kind of legislative statutory footing for the biodiversity action plan.<\/p><p>This would at least give it more teeth.  We are also seeking to improve the governance of the biodiversity action plan.  It is currently overseen by an interdepartmental group but I hope that we may be able to report to a higher level in the next round so that there will be a greater onus on people when we look for progress on actions in the plan because not all of these actions are undertaken by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Many of them are undertaken by our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, its forest service, the Environmental Protection Agency and many other Departments.  It is very important that there be a little bit more political scrutiny.  We also have a watchdog, the National Biodiversity Forum, which is a multi-stakeholder group that oversees the implementation of the plan and makes recommendations to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  We have increased funding for that forum to make sure that it functions properly, has a functioning secretariat and can really progress and give good recommendations.<\/p><p> On the NORA fund, correct me if I am wrong but the Bord na M&oacute;na rehabilitation scheme was originally funded from the climate action fund.  It may possibly have been passed over to the NORA fund but the &euro;108 million for the rehabilitation of post-production Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands is now being funded by the EU resilience fund.  We should all be looking at all of the available funds to ratchet up our restoration agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The discussion has been really interesting.  I will pick up on a couple of the wider framing issues.  The legislative issue Dr. Lynn mentioned with regard to putting the biodiversity plan on a solid statutory basis is really important.  Things like the pollinator plan also need more teeth.  Dr. Lynn might comment on things like that.  We could then move from these things being aspirational to being very solidly reflected in design.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by what Dr. Lynn said about 10% of the funding for biodiversity coming through the National Parks and Wildlife Service while 78% comes through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Do we need a little bit more to go through the National Parks and Wildlife Service?  The &euro;108 million for the rehabilitation scheme seems very small when we consider the &euro;600 million given out in jet kerosene tax reliefs in Ireland.  I am talking about scaling up.  It comes back to the idea of the mechanisms.  Dr. Lynn has mentioned that there are investors and so on and that a financial mechanism in respect of this work is being created but I am concerned that, in waiting to create this financial mechanism, we may not be doing what we can in the immediate and short term, when those actions are needed.  I am talking about public leadership on this issue with, perhaps, space for investors and about the need for scaling up.  Will Dr. Lynn comment on the issue of not just rehabilitation, but also rewetting and full restoration of peatlands so that there is no further degradation?  This strikes me as something that can either do good or do harm.  <\/p> <p>  I have a concern about over-reliance on the agriculture frame, even though it is important.  I refer to the carbon farming frame.  We might end up in a situation where we are measuring the protection of areas but solely in terms of carbon units.  Ecological care is slightly harder to measure but it is really important.  I am talking about the biodiversity piece.  Will Dr. Lynn comment on the importance of ecological care, biodiversity work and not just considering units of trees that may store carbon in 15 years' time but forests and areas of rich biodiversity and the role that they play?  Will she comment on the importance of making sure that these issues are not sublimated?  I am really interested because these are really important frames in terms of what we can do now and what could be done now, were &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million more put into peatlands, for example.<\/p> <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service and its resources must be strengthened to make sure it has independence and the required resources with regard to staff and so on.  That would be really useful.  There has been some engagement and a review on that issue.  Where is that going?<\/p> <p>  That complements another issue that has come up a lot in this committee's meetings, the issue of things like environmental impact assessments.  There is an under-resourcing with regard to ecologists, people who can deliver that work.  That is one of the reasons for the bottleneck.  It is not that we should be doing fewer environmental impact assessments.  We have even had wind energy companies tell us that they just want the area to be better resourced so that they can be carried out more efficiently.<\/p> <p>  I have two last points.  One relates to the part sound pollution, sonar and seismic activity in marine protected areas, MPAs, play in terms of biodiversity protection.  The other point is really important for right now, in June.  As Dr. Lynn has said, there are new global negotiations in Nairobi.  There seems to be a big international debate.  One piece relates to the protection of 30% of land and sea areas.  I am concerned that a conflict is being allowed to develop with regard to these 30% targets being achieved through working with different partners, including commercial partners, as Dr. Lynn mentioned, and the possibility of an effective land grab from indigenous peoples.  We know that indigenous people make up 5% of the global population but protect 80% of the world's biodiversity and 25% of the land.  We are talking about Nairobi, which is in Kenya, where Masai people live.  We are now seeing Masai people in Tanzania being evicted from their ancestral lands to allow those lands to become a conservation park, which will also be a hunting park for those who might bankroll it.  How do we resolve those tensions?  Can Ireland, which does not have as much tension in that regard, be a constructive voice on the issue within the international negotiations on the role of indigenous persons and protection?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#F00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>There is quite a lot for Dr. Lynn in that but I am sure she will do her best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#F00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>There is a lot to unpack there.  The pollinator plan the Senator mentioned is an amazing plan.  It provides excellent guidelines for different sectoral interests.  There has been a keen uptake.  There has also been support from some in private industry, such as SuperValu.  The pollinator plan was mainly drafted by Professor Jane Stout in Trinity College and the National Biodiversity Data Centre so it is not specifically a Government plan.  We sit on the steering committee and support it where we can.  It is possibly something we need to think about in the future.  I do not want to detract from the plan because it is doing really well.  To give credit where credit is due, it has done an excellent job.<\/p> <p>  On the bottlenecks, the Senator's observations were very interesting, particularly with regard to ecologists and to peatlands.  Restoring peatlands is quite complicated.  You have to make sure you have a really good rehabilitation and restoration plan.  That will involve hydrologists, ecohydrologists and engineers at the very start.  We do not have enough ecohydrologists who understand the interplay between elements of the water story, such as groundwater and the movement of water, and the ecology itself well enough to ensure that we are rehabilitating in the proper way.  If you gave us hundreds of millions tomorrow to ensure we had really good restoration plans, it could still be quite tricky to scale up.  That relates to raised bogs.  The situation is even more complex for blanket bogs with regard to their topography and very degraded systems that have been overgrazed for a long time.<\/p><p>There are complicated landowner systems as well.  It is complex to tease out and work through and that is what we are trying to do through the EU LIFE programme, Wild Atlantic Nature.  There is so much community involvement there, working with partners like Coillte and private investors as well.  They are trialling, testing and seeing what works on the ground and how to have that community buy-in, which is very important.  We probably have the machinery because there has been so much machinery taking the peat out of the ground that there is probably machinery and contract workers that could help with the restoration.  We are at a scientific support bottleneck.  Maybe we need to look elsewhere, to other EU countries, to try to bring in the skills we need to support this restoration agenda, particularly for bogs.<\/p><p> On supporting biodiversity and making sure it is also considered to be a common benefit, we are trying to have a biodiversity score and to work on that.  I refer to water also because the three are all interlinked.  We are working with Intel on a pilot restoration project in the Wicklow uplands.  Intel is interested in water and in seeing how much water will be restored if a bog is restored.  It is about linking all of those together and making sure that when we report back we can say what sort of emissions have been reduced, how biodiversity has improved and, where relevant, how much water has been stored.  Private investors are interested in all of those, for different reasons.  They have to make various disclosures under different processes and it is important for them to show what they are doing for biodiversity.  We are ensuring that we are trying to develop those scores at the same time.<\/p><p> The questions of sonar and the MPAs are probably outside of my area of expertise.  The Convention on Biological Diversity, CBD, is good at producing a lot of guidance and documents and there is a guidance document on underwater noise.  A lot of these documents will be taken through in the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, which is known as the OSPAR Convention, and through EU channels as well.  I am sure our colleagues in our marine section are dealing with a lot of that.<\/p><p> The matter of indigenous peoples is an interesting one.  From the beginning the CBD has involved the views of the indigenous people in local communities.  There is a whole article in the convention dedicated to that and to making sure they are involved in all aspects of decision-making.  It will be interesting to see what will be brought up in Nairobi on what has happened in Kenya recently and on how we deal with a lot of those conflicts.  I know they are very different situations but even in Ireland landowners need to be respected and we need to be able to talk to them and to explain to them the opportunities that are potentially there for them.  Everything has changed, particularly in the potential for carbon farming and the opportunities available to landowners.  They are starting to think in a different way and it will be an interesting next ten years in how all of this evolves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lynn and Senator Higgins.

The key thing for me is the 60 new staff she mentioned and the additional funding of &euro;55 million, which will have enormous benefits for the NPWS.  I know there will be an internal review to improve the service that is there.  I want to compliment Dr. Lynn and her colleagues within the NPWS for the work they do on a daily basis.  Its remit is quite broad, as Dr. Lynn outlined in her opening statement, but I want to touch on a few matters.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues that have been mentioned was the MPAs and the special protection areas, SPAs.  That was interesting to me because I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire, a coastal constituency, and one where we are familiar with the SPAs.  There has to be a balance between the SPAs and other uses of land adjacent to the SPAs.  We need to find that balance in order to try to make progress on various schemes.<\/p> <p>  I was glad to hear Dr. Lynn's emphasis on biodiversity.  The pollination corridors are a key function for some of the Tidy Towns groups.  I know that some officials in the local authorities, such as Anne Murray, the biodiversity officer in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, are keen on promoting them but we can never get enough of them.  I hear what Dr. Lynn is saying about open spaces and Deputy Alan Farrell referred to that as well.  They cannot all be manicured to within an inch of their lives either.  We have to let nature grow and we have to protect bees and other wildlife, such as birds, which Dr. Lynn referenced.  How does Dr. Lynn envisage that we can expand pollinating corridors and other such initiatives to ensure that is a crucial element in the next national biodiversity action plan?  We need to see progress being made, not just in rural areas but in urban areas as well.  In Dublin in particular we need to see greater progress on that.  I also agree with Dr. Lynn that there is great buy-in from the public on this.  They want to be informed so they can co-operate on and facilitate this, be that in their back garden, their estate or their community.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned biodiversity and Dr. Lynn will probably be familiar with Killiney Hill.  I have spoken here several times about the red squirrel project that was launched in 2015.  It was quite innovative at the time but again, local authorities are supported in this way to try to encourage greater biodiversity and protect certain species.  Dalkey Island has an Arctic tern colony and I know the NPWS has been greatly involved in that.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Lynn mentioned water quality and rivers.  We have to make a greater effort to the ensure the quality of water in our rivers.  They have improved in recent years but things like missed connections, particularly in urban areas, are a big issue.  It is amazing what one missed connection can do to the quality of a river in an urban area.  Dr. Lynn might speak to that point.<\/p> <p>  We need to see greater progress on reforestation too.  We need to protect the forests we have.  Again I am speaking from an urban perspective because we need to ensure we do everything we can under the next plan to safeguard the forests we enjoy, which are used by the public as great amenities.  I thank Dr. Lynn for her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#G00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I will comment on some of the Deputy&rsquo;s interesting intervention.  Pollination corridors are important in an urban setting and equally so across the country.  We need this green architecture across agricultural systems as well and it is important that we maintain our hedgerows.  We have a heterogenous landscape.  We are a farming nation, which I understand, and we need to produce food but we also need to make space for nature and to allow species to be able to move across the landscape.<\/p><p>Under the auspices of the next CAP strategic plan, I hope, therefore, that much more space will be made for nature in agricultural systems and that these types of connections will be made, especially in the face of climate change.  Species may have particular areas that they live in because of a specific climate envelope, and if that is shifted, then species may also need to shift.  Species must be able to move through and permeate the landscape, so it is important that we have all these collectivities and green architecture in place.<\/p><p> At the local level in urban areas, regarding embracing the pollinator plan, it has been encouraging just to see the increased level of awareness.  I also noticed that along all the motorways there are little signs for bees.  I drove up and down from Wexford recently, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is leaving the verges of the roads uncut for much of the summer to facilitate pollinators.  It is great to see that as well.  As I said, we provide funding to the heritage and biodiversity officers for local actions.  Many of the actions that are funded relate to pollinator actions.<\/p><p> Turning to the reafforestation, we have one of the lowest rates of native woodland cover in Europe.  I think it is running at less than 2% of native woodland, and this aspect must be addressed.  Through the land use review process, we should look across Ireland and exploring where we should focus our efforts.  I refer in particular to alluvium woodlands.  Many alluvial soils in this context would benefit from being wooded.  We need to protect our older oak woodlands and tackle invasive species.  We must also expand our complement of native woodlands.  Equally, regarding the monoculture of Sitka spruce plantations, I appreciate that it is a crop that we need for wood products, but these plantations must be sited in appropriate areas and certainly not on peatlands.  <\/p><p> The land use review referred to in the programme for Government is a good opportunity for us to come together and to look across the landscape and examine how we live in this landscape, in particular, how people live and how we should be live in harmony with nature within the landscape.  I say that because it is important for us all.  No sector should be polluting.  We really need to look at the common good in this regard.  This is what is important and what should be considered.  I am always very interested when I hear politicians talk about progress and growth, because I do not know what that means if it is not for the common good.  What is progress?  Is progress represented by certain big industries making lots of money?  I do not think that is progress.  Progress is when the common good is considered and that the fact that we all have the right to live in a healthy environment.  <\/p><p> It is great to see the red squirrels on Killiney Hill; I saw one.  It is always a joy to see that flash of red running in front of you.  I saw one in Wexford last weekend as well and your heart just skips a beat.  It is also great to see the pine marten population expanding and controlling the grey squirrel population.  When we get things back in balance, sometimes nature starts to fix itself.  Therefore, it is great to see the red squirrels-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Those red squirrels originate in Wexford, so Dr. Lynn is correct about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#H00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>It is lovely to see when things start improving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I would also like Dr. Lynn to comment on river water quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#H00400","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Again, in urban settings, this subject would be very much outside my remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Okay.

I have seen, possibly since about 2019, biodiversity creeping up the agenda in other Departments.  They are really starting to listen.  We are having many more cross-departmental meetings.

Interestingly, it may be the climate agenda that has spearheaded the way in respect of this agenda infiltrating awareness and achieving a whole-of-government approach to an issue.

The Department of Health, for example, has had a massive agenda of its own to deal with in recent years in the context of Covid-19, but there are also important crossovers between a healthy environment and health issues and, therefore, trying to build up expertise in health and education will also be important for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I have raised the issue of rodenticide with the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, but also that of formaldehyde, glyphosate and all these chemicals that are readily available.

What is Dr. Lynn's sense of the appetite that is there to review very long-standing national legislation?  I am thinking of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, which I looked at recently, and I found a paper written by a young researcher in the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, named Richard Bruton who explored the matter in depth.  I find he is sitting opposite me now, and he might wish to contribute on the point.<\/p> <p>  The Arterial Drainage Act was placed on the Statute Book primarily to facilitate the draining of land for agriculture.  It is fair to say that the impact of the Arterial Drainage Act is that the ability of much of our land to hold on to its water has been compromised.  It has led to much downstream flooding, including flash flooding.  We know this is an issue with the management of flooding and we must consider it in that way but I am also thinking of biodiversity.  There must be serious implications for biodiversity in this country, particularly in wetter land, due to the Arterial Drainage Act.  It is 51 years since the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.  It does not seem consistent to me that we would have an Act - a pillar of the Statute Book - that requires us to drain so much land annually.  We spend much time doing so as well and it seems much of that money could be turned over to biodiversity restoration instead of investing it in draining land.  I am interested to hear Dr. Lynn's views of that, if she has any.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#J00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>From a biodiversity perspective, I am very much in favour of natural systems where possible, including natural flood plains.

We might hear Deputy Bruton's views on the matter.<\/p> <p>  We must assess much of what we do and, in particular, the costs we put in versus the benefits we get.  We must value the ecosystem services that biodiversity gives us in water retention in particular with this instance.  We must consider such a cost-benefit analysis.  I understand the sensitivities around households or urban areas being flooded.  However, and possibly as part of the land use review, we should be looking at all of this, including watershed systems and where water is held.  We should start from the head waters in the mountains and ensure our blanket bogs are in good order so they can retain water before it comes into our lowland systems as well.<\/p> <p>  Under the climate action plan, there are actions relating to the rewetting of agricultural peatlands.

Is that a provocation?  Looking at a programme of drainage in a cost-benefit analysis comes down to what we count as costs versus what we count as benefits.  The reality is that if in ten years we price carbon at &euro;100 per tonne, a hectare of land devoted to beef farming, for example, where margins are extremely low, would be tiny next to the &euro;400 per hectare carbon impact.  The issue is how to measure that and whether it factors into the costs and benefits that a farmer looks at, or, indeed, the policymaker.  The difficulty we have is we are not looking at this in a sufficiently holistic way in order to take account of the carbon impacts as well.  The logic is that we pay farmers to switch the use of their land and take a different view.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should be taking a similar view when it assesses different schemes for support.  If we just look at the very narrow silos I referred to earlier, we tend to become blind to those wider impacts.<\/p> <p>  That is why I strongly favour integrating the way we approach challenges like this into the sort of circular thinking that considers how to design the advantage and pay to make it happen.  The reality is that in ten years, other sectors of the economy will be expending &euro;1,000 per tonne for carbon abatement, which could be done very profitably by many in the rural communities and provide a huge alternative income source to them.  We must be imaginative in developing the instruments for that to happen.  Those instruments are not proceeding as quickly as we are signing up to ambitions.  We must devote more to getting those financial and economics people into the room with the likes of Dr. Lynn in order to design those policies rather than having them sitting in the Departments of Finance or Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or wherever they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#J00700","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I must admit I did not read the ESRI paper from 1982.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#J00800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I would not burden the Chairman with it.

I have a similar perspective to Deputy Bruton on where things are going but a slightly different perspective of how to approach it.  The finance actors and others are very much already there and moving.  What is really important is that public ideas and policy goals can be placed centre stage in order that they are not lost.<\/p><p>It is something we need to be aware of because while the distinction is not as clear in Ireland, it is important internationally.  Indigenous peoples and local communities are not necessarily the same as landowners.  If we use the term \"landowner\" as shorthand for indigenous peoples, it is problematic.  There are many industries that need to deliver on carbon impact abatement.  We are seeing very large international land grabs by massive investment firms because there is a market that they correctly see coming - and it is coming - for carbon.  I do not think they are the people who need motivating.  They are there already.  I do not know the detail of the Intel project; it sounds really interesting.  It is also really important that any carbon sequestration that companies engage in is not done to allow them to expand areas of their business, for example, data centres.  I do not know if that is happening.  Our national targets in carbon emission reductions need to be achieved.  It is imperative that public land in particular, and even semi-private public land and other land, is used as part of the national carbon abatement process.  We should also look at the jobs that we can create and support through that in terms of ecological care, rather than simply motivating the market.  The market is already motivated.  For me, the question is whether our other biodiversity and ecological goals will really be delivered and whether we are doing all that we can with the land that we, as a State, can access.  I think that is important.  That is where the tension will be.  There are huge areas of biodiversity that have been protected by indigenous people.  For countries that want to hit their 30% protection target, the easy thing to do is to relabel a whole area of indigenous land - with a commercial partner - as being a biodiversity protection zone that can be commercially marketed.  It is a real tension.  The good thing is that everybody realises that we need to protect land.  How it is done and the approach taken are really important.  That is where having a public leadership vision is important.  I hope that we scale that up.<\/p><p> I also ask Dr. Lynn to comment on invasive species and the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  The SDGs, and particularly those that focus life on land and life on water and goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, have really interesting targets around biodiversity and habitat protection.  Invasive species is an issue.  The protection of the native honeybee is a measure that we are currently considering in the Seanad at the moment.  It seems to me to fit within those SDGs.  I ask Dr. Lynn to comment on addressing invasive species and the other SDG targets, as well as on the capacity that we need to increase in respect of environmental impact assessments, the habitats directive, the birds directive and the water directive.  Is there potential to have the same kind of tools that we are using there to begin to incorporate and consider some of the SDG targets on biodiversity alongside that work?  Could we upskill in that area in terms of the kind of ecological and environmental impact assessments that we are doing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#J01300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>On invasive species, we are going to be introducing new national legislation to implement the new EU regulation.

There is quite a general crossover with everything that we already do in relation to sustainable use and protecting mountain ecosystems.  There are also targets relating to ecosystem accounting, and making sure that it is built into our national accounts.  It goes back to looking at the value of nature, how we build that into our national accounts and moving on to how we do our cost-benefit analysis and understand those values.  There has been some movement on that.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, will report back to EUROSTAT on some of these elements.  It will start building up expertise in this area.  It is great to see the CSO coming on board.  <\/p> <p>  On the CBD and the public land element, lots of safeguards are built into the convention.  We hope that very strong lines will be taken in terms of the protection of indigenous lands to ensure that the international community is not promoting land grabs.  The ecosystem approach contains 12 principles.  It brings it right back down to the level of the people who were involved with the land at that point.  We are doing work in trying to bring in private investors to help support the restoration agenda.  We are going to produce a peatland code, which will be a sort of restoration code.  We will seek agreement on the code across a lot of different players and stakeholders to ensure that we do not have that slightly sinister move in certain areas towards a land grab.  It has not been happening in Ireland.  None of the companies that we are dealing with are showing any interest in that vein.  They are more keen to support our work.  However, I do not know, in that at the beginning, they might be seeing what is happening and how it works, building up to something.  We are being very careful in the early phases.

As well as looking at the EU tools, including environmental impact assessments and considering the directives, I was asking whether there is an opportunity for upskilling on the SDGs and the targets and indicators within them to enable us to begin to factor them in and think about them in planning processes or decision-making, for example.  My question was around awareness.  The SDGs are meant to be getting integrated into everything that we are doing.

Dr. Lynn is correct.  I have been discussing the issue of land grabbing in the international context.  Dr. Lynn mentioned cost-benefit analysis.  There are other important points to raise in respect of the EU.  First, due diligence legislation is coming through.  Second, according to the EU rules on taxonomy, biodiversity should not be damaged.  It is meant to be one of the safeguards built into the taxonomy.  Therefore, we have one legislative tool and one investment tool that require the collation of solid information around biodiversity and the environment.  Is that done through the CSO or will the Department have to upskill staff to ensure that the relevant information is being gathered as part of due diligence and decisions around the taxonomy?  Lastly, the EU proposal on the nature restoration law is due to be adopted on 22 June.  The law may well be considered by this committee and others.  I ask Dr. Lynn for her thoughts on the new restoration law and the package that goes with it.

I am not clear where the reporting lines go back in when they report back.  I assume that goes in on an EU level, for them to determine whether they have undertaken due diligence and they have proceeded with \"do no harm\".  We have also just launched our own business and biodiversity platform.  We have some founding members for that platform.  We launched it at the biodiversity conference last year.  That is to try to bring businesses on board, to engage them and ensure that they understand the opportunities available to them and their dependencies.  There will be webinars on how they look at their supply chains and how they undertake many of those activities.  There is quite a big business movement ongoing at present at national level and at EU level, where is a business and biodiversity platform.  I think it is called a business movement in the EU biodiversity strategy.  The EU is ramping up, as well, in terms of supporting businesses and bringing them along and both sides exchanging their views.<\/p><p> The nature restoration law will be very significant.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has already requested that very high-level officials get together to discuss the implications of the EU restoration law when it comes out.  There may be different threads to this.  There will be targets relating to the numbers of the EU protected habitats and species returning to favourable status or ensuring no further decline and there could be wider ecosystem targets for restoration.  We have to draw up our own national restoration plan, as well.  We have to have discussions about who leads on these big biodiversity agenda items.  Where restoration has to happen, agricultural policies will have to be considered.  We will have to figure out how we all work together to develop that restoration plan in the next six months.

I have done it in my garden where I have stopped cutting and taken away any of the inputs.  The number of different species in the garden is incredible.  They self-seeded.

I do not know if she has seen any of the articles.  An excellent article was recently written by Dr. Noeleen Smyth who used to work in the National Botanic Gardens and is now an associate professor of horticulture in UCD.  I share her views.  One's back garden is one's own.  One should absolutely be able to plant whatever one likes there.  There is no problem with some urban areas and some communities having a nice floral display, perhaps of seed mix.  It is the messaging in terms of whether it is said to be pro-biodiversity.  In some of those cases, it is not really the best thing for biodiversity.  Many of them are not considered to be from native seed sources.  The best thing for biodiversity is to reduce mowing and cut late in the season to allow flowers to flower, seed and increase diversity and to provide a food source for pollinators throughout the season; one with which these pollinators have evolved.  I love dandelions, which are absolutely beautiful, and regular lawn mixes of daisies, buttercups, dandelions and clover.  It is amazing that one sees many people on Twitter now saying they have left an area for a couple of years and showing what is coming up now.  The amount of diversity that can come through those small grassy areas within a few years is remarkable and a real joy to see.  It depends.  I advise caution but one does not want to get totally preachy about it and say \"absolutely not\" to all seed mixes, in all cases.  People have a right to do what they want in their own gardens.  As far as I am aware, we have not undertaken any studies on the content of these seed mixes.  Dr. Smyth may have started on some of that, but I am not entirely sure.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the current structures within NPWS and whether we can work effectively across Departments, from my own experience it has been very challenging.  My original role had been monitoring and reporting.  We were reporting back to the EU.  We were commissioning many surveys and coming up with trends of status.  One layers on top of that to link in within the climate, restoration, international and EU agendas.  It can be very challenging and it is really heartening to see that has been recognised and that we are getting the injection of staff to at least get us back to 2008 levels and then, with further injections in the years to come.<\/p> <p>  When we start rebuilding, we will, I hope, be a louder and more informed voice.  The agenda is very big.  When one is trying to get one's head around all of the EU regulations and the financial implications, one has to put the time and effort into research and review as well.  It would be great to be able to focus back in on that.  I have come from the scientific unit and the idea is that we will be allowed to breathe more and get back into the science and research, in order that we can have a very good understanding and be able to come to fora such as this to give our expert opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>It has been great to tune into the conversation with Dr. Lynn.

Does Dr. Lynn feel that it would be a good idea that, instead of that being a European average, it is done on a country-by-country basis?  The reason I say that is that some EU nations are quite strong already on their conservation areas and protected areas and some are quite weak, and I would include Ireland in the latter.  If we use this average, is there a tendency to let some countries off lightly?<\/p> <p>  The upcoming agri-environment scheme will be launched shortly.  The NPWS has a role in that, particularly from the points of view of science and data collection.  As for the co-operation areas, that is, the areas, particularly in the west of Ireland, where farmers will be able to avail of the highest payments for results-based or bespoke schemes, I feel there is potentially a lack of data in some of those areas.  For example, the Beara Peninsula and large parts of Kerry in the south west are included, but the Mizen Peninsula, which has very similar features and species to those of the Beara Peninsula, is for some reason excluded.  It is said that that is based on scientific data and NPWS data, but is it worth commenting that there is probably a lack of data in a lot of these areas and that, therefore, they should be looked at again?  I feel there will be very much a missed opportunity if we leave large portions of those areas out.  Dr. Lynn might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I attended the biodiversity conference during the week.  The following is more of a general point.  I would like a comment on it from Dr. Lynn.  One of the recurring comments was that we tend in most western countries to measure wealth specifically as economic and financial wealth and that the wealth of our national heritage and biodiversity does not really feature.  Does Dr. Lynn think we should look at that going forward and that when we measure the wealth of a country or how well a country is doing, we should include that?<\/p> <p>  I have one more question.  I am sorry for overwhelming Dr. Lynn with these.  My last question is about biodiversity officers.  Dr. Lynn touched on it in previous comments.  At the moment we have heritage officers but, unfortunately, when they are in local authorities, the scope of their work is just so broad that biodiversity can sometimes very much take a back seat.  For example, the biodiversity officer in Cork County Council does a fantastic job, but his role is very much focused on heritage, history and the unveiling of plaques for commemorations.  There seems to be very little focus on biodiversity.  I would like an update on the role of biodiversity officers and how quickly we might see them rolled out into local authorities.  Local authorities are significant landowners and, therefore, have a significant role to play in protecting biodiversity and increasing habitat.  Therefore, biodiversity teams - not just an officer - and plans are absolutely essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#M00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>There was plenty there for you, Dr. Lynn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#M00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I will tackle the question of whether all EU countries should have 30% targets.  We really need to look at the landscape of a lot of the EU countries.  Some of them are quite extensively forested with natural forests, and a lot of those are state-owned natural forests, so a lot of those countries may have quite a higher proportion of their areas protected.  Ireland's landscape is quite complex in respect of the average landholding size, particularly in the west, where probably most of our more pristine biodiversity areas are, so it is slightly more complicated.  If you look at how long it took us to get through the process of the 14% we have protected, I think we have learned a lot of lessons from that process.  We really need to sit down and think about where we should target to increase some of that terrestrial area.  We certainly should make sure we have captured any of our remaining old oak forests in that as well as, perhaps, some more of our wetlands and fens.  Both those would be more carbon-rich systems.<\/p> <p>  There is probably a reason for the different percentages in different countries.  Also, Ireland is 90% marine, which is very important to remember.  I think and hope that that is where our contribution will be, proportionately higher than a lot of the other EU countries are in the marine sphere.  We need to look at our State-owned and public lands.  We are looking at our landbanks for housing; we should look at our landbanks for biodiversity purposes as well.  Then we should look very closely at any of the areas where we have been putting EU money in for restoration purposes as well.<\/p> <p>  As for the lack of data and data collection, we have over the years been building up our monitoring data sets.  It is quite costly to go out and get ecologists in the field, particularly in remote and upland areas and to get really good habitat maps of a lot of our upland or coastal complexes.  However, we have been building them over time, and there is the new land cover map that has been produced by Ordnance Survey Ireland in conjunction with the EPA.  That will be released soon and will give us a much better resolution of the type of land cover across Ireland.  We dealt with a much cruder map in previous times, so we should have a lot more information.<\/p> <p>  We also now need to look towards more interpretation of satellite imagery.  I remember trying that back in around 2006, it must have been.  We commissioned some satellite imagery from, I think, somewhere in Mayo.  I remember at the time recognising that there would be cloud cover - it is Ireland and some imaging will be lost to cloud cover - but I did not realise there was cloud shadow as well.  We lost a lot to the shadow of the cloud.<\/p><p> All these technologies are improving over time and different types of remote sensing can also be used to get over this.  We are continually developing in that area.  Some very good EPA-funded projects have been developing habitat mapping using remote imagery.  We hope our data sets will build over time.  In agriculture, people are looking to get biodiversity inventories of many farms.<\/p><p> We need to build a lot of this information together.  The biodiversity data centre has obviously been collecting a large amount of species information for us over time and that is building.  We are undertaking many measures so we need to look at where these conservation measures are being undertaken, whether they are effective and what change has occurred.  We have applied for funding to European mechanisms called strategic integrated projects and strategic nature projects under the EU LIFE instrument.  This funding would enable us to collate much of this information and build the architecture to give us all better access and better up-to-date data and information.  That is building and we have much to do in that area.<\/p><p> On wealth, as I said, I always think we should be measuring progress by our common good.  Various indices are worked on, for example, the happiness index.  There should be a different one rather than having only straightforward GDP because it is not a good measure of how the general population are feeling.  We need to address that.<\/p><p> On the biodiversity officers, we recognised the need for biodiversity officers to be in all local authorities and that programme is being rolled out over the next couple of years.  The Heritage Council is spearheading that development.  I hope that once we get a large number of them in place and they are working effectively with the heritage officers, it will have a snowball effect and we can get more funding, possibly through the local area groups under LEADER and under Agenda 21, which perhaps has been renamed.  We also have funding for that level, from which teams can be built up.  That is what we did in the NPWS.  There could be one scientist who was the expert in an area and that person would have to go out and survey that area throughout the whole country.  In such cases, the work would be commissioned and the person would use the expertise of consultants but would still go out and do the work.  I hope that when teams build up, they will be in a position to engage in a lot of action on the ground and bring on board more expertise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Lynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I will ask one more question since no one else is indicating.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Lynn mentioned that birds were not her area of expertise.

It is to be hoped the curlew project will have some success.  As part of the new agri-environment schemes, we will see more wading species included in the bespoke schemes.  We have seen the success of the hen harrier project and the corncrake project is having success.  Certain species of birds that sometimes go under the radar are disappearing in front of our eyes.  If Dr. Lynn is unable to answer this, perhaps she could feed it back to the Department.  I am thinking of farmland passerines, which include the linnet and buntings such as the yellowhammer.  The yellowhammer in particular is a bird that is pretty much disappearing in front of our eyes.  Unless we intervene, it will meet the same fate as the corn bunting, which is extinct in Ireland.  Is there a plan in the NPWS or the Department to go further than the current schemes for wading species and raptors, which are easier to create, and consider schemes for smaller passerines which are declining at an alarming rate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022061400002#N00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I will have to come back to the Deputy on that.

The section is unconstitutional since the repeal of the eighth amendment.  I am surprised to see this is still here following previous commitments from the Minister about it.  When the 2015 Act was passed, section 85(6) provided that an advance healthcare directive would be valid or applicable insofar as it contained the refusal of treatment that would have a deleterious effect on the unborn.  The 2022 Bill, as it stands, does not remove this language despite the subsequent repeal of the eighth amendment of the Constitution and the enactment of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  I propose the deletion of section 85(6) to ensure that all pregnant people can avail of advance healthcare directives.  The report on the pre-legislative scrutiny also recommended this, in recommendation 54.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 is a red line for me.  I have mentioned it to the Minister a number of times.  It relates to people detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  This section relates to the removal of section 85(7) to allow advance healthcare directives to be extended to those involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act.  Leaving this section in is discriminatory to those with mental health difficulties and does not allow for parity of treatment for all Irish citizens.  Every citizen of this country must be afforded an equal right to exercise their will and preference.  This must apply to mental health as well as physical health.  We could be waiting for years for the update of the Mental Health Act.  I am on the Sub-Committee on Mental Health, which is addressing that Act at the moment.  This is my second committee meeting today.  I have no recollection of a discussion about assisted decision-making capacity when we were getting the report on the Mental Health Act ready.  I do not know how we are going to review or amend the Act when we have not even discussed it at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.<\/p><p>The Mental Health Commission and the Decision Support Service support the extension of this right to people under the Mental Health Act.  I have discussed the dangers of not extending this right under Part 4 to people with the Minister previously.  In 2020, 2,463 people were involuntarily admitted under the Act.  That means that an average of 2,500 people a year could be subjected to forced psychiatric treatment, the forced administration of medication and forced electroconvulsive therapy without the protection of a legally binding advance healthcare directive.  People's mental health difficulties are often episodic.  The do not happen all the time.  They have an idea of what their treatment should be and what worked for them in the past.  If they make an advance healthcare directive, it is informed.  People who provide an advance healthcare directive relating to physical care would not have the same experience as somebody who has mental health difficulties and episodic issues.  I do not know how my physical health will be in five years, but people with a history of mental health difficulties know what treatment works for them and they should be able to have an advance healthcare directive.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 17 addresses 16- and 17-year-olds.  Currently, they can consent to or refuse physical healthcare decisions, but this does not apply to mental health care decisions.  They do not have any right to consent to or refuse mental health treatment.  I hope that will change in the review of the Mental Health Act.  At the moment, they cannot refuse hospital admission.  Guardians can decide to admit them without their consent and 16- and 17-year-olds cannot refuse a particular course of treatment, such as electroconvulsive therapy, or even conversion therapy, which came up the last time we discussed this.  The review of the Mental Health Act might bring those issues into line but we do not know how far away that is.  There is no national advocacy service for people under the age of 18 who are accessing mental health services.  Young people are not having their voices heard about mental health care and treatment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 19 seeks to remove section 85(7) to allow advance healthcare directives to be extended to those involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act.  As I said, leaving this section in is discriminatory to those with mental health difficulties and does not allow for parity of treatment for all Irish citizens.  I will not repeat that argument.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 27 is also about people detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act.  They are the only cohort excluded from access to the protections of this Bill.  It is discriminatory and exclusionary.  They should not be omitted.  It needs to be deleted in line with the upcoming mental health legislation.  There are two Department of Health amendments, which require the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill to include mental health and to which we would like to bring the Minister's attention.  They are on page 165 of the draft heads of Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001, contained in the explanatory notes.  This amendment introduces designated healthcare representatives as per sections 88(1) and 136 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  An amendment is required to ensure these provisions can operate and ensure parity of treatment for those with mental health issues.  Subsection 2 reflects recommendations 126 to 131, which recommend that the advance healthcare directives should apply to persons receiving treatment under this Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#C00700","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I should have said that Deputy Whitmore's name is also attached to amendment No. 19, so she can speak and the Minister can respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#C00800","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>My party colleague, Deputy Cairns, is unable to make it today.

Amendment No. 1 seeks to repeal section 85(6) of the 2015 Act.  Section 85(6) was originally included to qualify and limit the application of advance healthcare directives in the context of pregnancy.  As Deputies will be aware, the provisions regarding advance healthcare directives set out in Part 8 of the Act of 2015 are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  My Department has been in contact with the Department of Health in the preparation of the Bill, including on this proposed amendment.  Section 85(6) was inserted into the original 2015 Act to take account of the previous constitutional position regarding the unborn.  Following the repeal of the eighth amendment, that position has changed.  As was said during the Second Stage debate, I am happy to agree to the deletion of section 85(6) and I have issued instructions to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft the required provisions.  That will allow for formal drafting.  I do not propose to accept Deputy Ward's amendment specifically but I will be bringing forward a Government amendment on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that will fully delete section 85(6).<\/p> <p>  I will turn to amendments Nos. 2, 19 and 27.  There is no disagreement between us on the importance of parity in the operation of advance healthcare directives to physical and other types of healthcare and to mental healthcare.  However, this is a technically complex issue.  We are looking at it in light of the ongoing work with regard to the entire revision of the Mental Health Act 2001.  It is important to look at what is being done here in that context.  For that reason, I am not in a position to accept these two amendments that would impact section 85(7) and section 136.<\/p> <p>  The application of the 2015 Act to persons whose treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 is currently being considered by the Department of Health.  It is appropriate that full and proper consideration would be given to this within the context of the ongoing reform of the 2001 Act.  In particular, that consideration needs to benefit from the policy and clinical expertise on the issue of mental health that exists within the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Health and I are in full agreement with Deputies that there is a need for parity of care.  I want to be clear that there is no question of the issue not being addressed.  The Government will address the gap here but there is a risk of moving too hastily in making the changes and not properly sequencing what we are doing with this legislation and the Mental Health Act.  That 2001 Act is going to be radically changed, if not entirely replaced, by the new mental health reform Bill.  I note there have been calls for the outright deletion of these provisions.  I cannot commit to doing that in what we are addressing today.  However, this issue will be addressed within the context of the reform of the 2001 Act.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ward asked where we are with respect to the reform of the 2001 Act.  My understanding is that work is under way.  A general scheme was approved by the Government and published in July 2021.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is currently working with the Attorney General's office to progress the completion of the Bill in a timely manner.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is being undertaken by the Sub-Committee on Mental Health and it is a priority for the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to get that legislation passed.  Last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I met with representatives of Mental Health Reform.  They clearly articulated the concerns that Deputies Ward and Whitmore have also articulated.  We responded with our concerns about acting without the overall understanding of the change that is going to be made to the mental health legislation.  The real concern relates to people who are involuntarily detained where there is a risk of them doing harm to somebody else.  We must consider to what extent a decision by such people to refuse certain treatments on the basis of an advance healthcare directive will then prevent a clinician undertaking a treatment that lessens the risk of harm to somebody else.  That is the central issue.  There is a complicated balance of constitutional rights involved.  The issue must be addressed but there is a tricky balance to strike.  That is why we feel that the analysis and balancing required is best undertaken through the wider understanding of the mental health reforms.  Whatever is decided in terms of that balance can then be used to amend the 2015 Act.<\/p> <p>  We committed to the representatives of Mental Health Reform, and I am happy to commit again, that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I will write to the Minister for Health and seek an on-the-record commitment from the Government to address this particular issue and also to seek an update on the timeline for the delivery of a completed Bill on mental health reform, which I know is very much desired in response to this issue and a whole range of other issues.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 17 addresses an issue that must be looked at in the context of wider reform.  The issue here is slightly narrower.  While I cannot accept amendment No. 17 today, I will continue to engage with the Departments of Health and Justice on the issue of the application of the Bill to 16- and 17-year-olds.  This amendment would allow minors who have reached the age of 16 to make an advance healthcare directive.  It would, in effect, allow minors to make decisions regarding their own treatment.  The 2015 Act was designed for adults because it related to decisions about property, banking and the like; 16- and 17-year-olds were not considered because they are thought not to have capacity in respect of the commercial issues that much of the Act addresses.  It was never envisaged that the 2015 Act would apply to those under the age of 15, having regard to their legal status as minors.  That remains the position in most cases.  However, I am aware in the context of healthcare that 16- and 17-year-olds have the legal capacity to consent to medical, surgical and dental treatment.  Persons under the age of 18 have agency but there is a body of case law that is not entirely clear about the capacity of a 16- or 17-year-old to refuse consent to a treatment if their parent or guardian wishes them to take that treatment.  That is another example of the balancing issues involved.<\/p> <p>  I am wary not to overpromise.  The issue here may be a little less broad than the issue we were speaking about in respect of the previous set of amendments.  We will go back to the Departments of Health and Justice and see if there is anything that could be brought forward on Committee Stage.  I cannot make an absolute commitment at this point.  I see the need but a balancing is required.  Those 16- and 17-year-olds can consent but there remains a question mark over their capacity to refuse consent, particularly when there is a clash in views between them and their parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#D00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I am surprised to see there remains a reference to a \"deleterious effect on the unborn\" in the Bill at this stage.

Why was this issue not flagged with that Department to make sure it would form part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill?  There is a report coming out very soon.

That is the key issue.  We do not have an answer to that question and that issue of balance as of yet.

Disabled persons organisations, DPOs, and disabled people themselves have repeatedly been left out of the narrative on decisions that affect their lives.  The State has a requirement under the UNCRPD to engage directly with disabled people on legislation that affects them.  They must be given their voice.  This is not being done sufficiently, though, and we need to legislate for it.  The Decision Support Service, DSS, is doing good work, but there needs to be legislation to allow it to apply for the resources it needs to facilitate this engagement.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, we were told on pre-legislative scrutiny stage that it should be a case of nothing about us without us where disabled people were concerned.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 inserts two further guiding principles.  Regarding the first of those, the amendment reads: \"The guiding principles contained in subsections (1) to (10) above shall be interpreted consistently with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular, Article 12, and General Comment 1 of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\"  Now that Ireland has ratified the UNCRPD, embedding an explicit reference in guiding principles strengthens the potential for the Act to be interpreted in a manner compatible with the human rights obligations under the convention.  The Act was continually referred to by successive Ministers during its development as being an essential part of Ireland&rsquo;s preparations for ratifying the UNCRPD.  Agreeing this amendment recognises that best practice in this field is continually evolving and reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to refining and reinterpreting our law in a manner consistent with our human rights obligations.  Agreeing this amendment signals Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a progressive and evolving interpretation of this law in light of the emerging understanding of human rights law.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the second guiding principle, the amendment reads: \"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as imposing any civil or criminal liability on an intervenor, who, in exercising his or her relevant powers, acted in good faith and in accordance with what, at the time in question, he or she reasonably believed to be the will and preferences of the relevant person.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.\"  This provision is designed to counteract the criminal offences in decision supports under the principal Act and the 2022 Bill and to remove the emphasis on punishment for getting it wrong where the intervenor has, in good faith, done his or her utmost to assert the relevant person&rsquo;s will and preference and acted accordingly.  This will give much-needed reassurance to individuals considering taking on these roles that they will not be penalised for doing so.  It should also ensure that relevant persons can call upon a wider range of potential supporters.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 16 reads: \"adhere to the obligations set out in Article 4.3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.\"<\/p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 44, the Disability Act 2005 takes an overly medical model approach to the definition of a disability compared with the conceptualisation of disability under Article 1 of the UNCRPD.  The UN&rsquo;s understanding of disability is broader than that covered under the Disability Act and is more inclusive and reflective of different experiences, for example, people who have experience of mental health services but do not identify with any label or diagnosis and people who have experienced disability-based discrimination even though they do not themselves identify as disabled people.  Given that the function of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, disability advisory group is to support IHREC&rsquo;s work on the UNCRPD, it would be more appropriate to take the convention&rsquo;s approach to disability rather than the narrow definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Disability Act. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#G00700","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Ireland ratified the UNCRPD in 2018.  As such, the country is bound by that Government decision to the obligations contained within the convention.  However, to do what Deputy Sherlock is proposing would be unusual, and possibly even inappropriate, in that it would require the courts under an individual Act to have regard to all the provisions of the convention when the State has already ratified that convention.  When we interact with international law, if we want to bring the text of a convention into domestic law, we do so by an Act of the Oireachtas.  For example, we signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, and subsequently incorporated it into domestic law.  We put the entire text of the convention into a Bill, which became the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  We can debate whether we want to make every piece of the UNCRPD directly applicable, which is what the Deputy is attempting to do through a one-provision line.  To be constitutionally appropriate, though, we would need the full substantive text of the convention to be incorporated into a Bill if we were looking to make the courts directly bound by every provision of that convention.  As such, I am not comfortable with what the Deputy is proposing.  Perhaps there is room to discuss whether something like it could be done in future, but it would have to follow the model we adopted with the ECHR, where every provision of that convention was put into a Bill and the Oireachtas had the ability to understand the implications of deciding the question.<\/p> <p>  I referenced another matter on Second Stage, namely, that section 8 of the 2015 Act set out strong guiding principles that showed what we were about.  I will probably speak to them in the context of some of the later amendments.  We are not just dealing with the Bill that is before us, which is an amending Bill and is quite dry in its sections.  A comprehensive Act was passed in 2015.  Unfortunately, it has not been implemented yet, but it has a clear, principles-centred approach to the change that it represents in moving away from the status approach to wardship towards considering people&rsquo;s individual capacities in the context of their particular situations.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 5, 8 and 16 call for a regulation-making power for the Minister in terms of consultation.  We are concerned about placing this consultation obligation in legislation.  We signed up to the convention in 2018 and one of the obligations flowing from it is that we engage in consultation with DPOs.<\/p><p>If we start to feel that we have to put that in legislation every time, does it suggest that, where we do not have a consultation obligation, the Government, the Minister, the Department or the agency does not have to consult?  One of the ideas behind signing up to the UNCRPD was that there would be a general obligation to consult with DPOs.  If we start specifying this here, then it will look like we have to specify it in primary legislation every time.  Otherwise, the argument can grow that, because we have not specified that the Minister must consult a DPO, the obligation does not apply.  There is a risk in enumerating in legislation every time we have to do something if there is a wider obligation that already sets out that we are to engage in that type of consultation.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 7 would introduce two new subsections on guiding principles and the UNCRPD into section 8 of the 2015 Act.  I have a similar concern to the one I had about Deputy Sherlock's proposal in amendment No. 3.  Deputy Ward is looking to use the general comment of the UNCRPD as a reference source, but the general comment is not drafted as a legislative document or a treaty.  It is a discursive interpretative piece and probably does not have the degree of specificity necessary to be used as the source of strict legislative approaches.<\/p><p> On changing the criminal law element, the Deputy is moving to a subjective basis for how the court would determine whether a criminal offence had been committed.  There is a concern over this.  On the one hand, we want to encourage people to take on the role of intervenor but, on the other, there are certain standards that intervenors have to meet in the care that they show in exercising that role.  I would be concerned if this were decided on a purely subjective basis - the person thought that what he or she was doing was okay and, therefore, he or she was not guilty of an offence - and the court was directed to rule on that element.  It creates a threshold that is arguably too low.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 44 seeks to assign an alternative meaning to \"disability\" that is different from the one set out in statute under the Disability Act 2005.  I understand that the intention is to insert a social model definition in the 2015 Act, but the definition in the convention is not tight enough to function as a legal definition for the Statute Book.  It is important that the definition we use be consistent and well aligned across this Bill, the 2015 Act, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 and the Disability Act.  The 2005 Act is well known and well used, so I would be worried if we started creating inconsistencies in our definition of \"disability\" across a range of Acts that were meant to work together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#G00800","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I take it from the Minister that he is not minded to accept my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#H00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>No.  I am sorry if I was unclear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#H00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>On that basis, I seek leave to withdraw my amendment and submit it again on Report Stage.

By adding the amendment, there would be recognition of what was best practice within the field and a reaffirmation of Ireland's commitment to refining and interpreting the law in a manner consistent with our human rights obligations.  While the Minister and I will not depart from the necessity of ensuring that we promulgate in a way that is consistent with our human rights obligations, I remain hopeful that he will revert to this matter on Report Stage.  If he is determined not to accept the amendment, is there a wording that the Government side could come up with for a specific provision in the legislation to ensure that the courts \"shall construe this Act\" in a manner that gives effect to the UNCRPD?

This legislation could prohibit someone from becoming an intervenor if the emphasis was on punishment for getting something wrong that was being done for the right reason.  There are laws in place dealing with any criminal act, whatever it may be, and these protect people.

I take what Deputy Ward is saying on board.  We have the DSS to support people, engage with those who are becoming intervenors and provide them with guidance and reassurance about how they can do their job well.  However, the UNCRPD also requires safeguards in respect of those who have the role of supporting people who have some restriction on their capacity.  Notwithstanding the Deputy's point about there already being rules, some of the positions that we are creating are positions of significant trust and it is important that the law signifies that abuse of that trust is a major issue.  The DSS and this Bill can only work with the engagement of intervenors and with people being comfortable with that, and I believe that the DSS will be able to provide that support.  I take on board the Deputy's point, but we all know of instances where people have taken advantage of others and, therefore, we are not discussing situations that are outside the realm of possibility.  It is important that the legislation set out a clear criminal prohibition in that respect.<\/p><p>On the point made by Deputy Sherlock on bolting the UNCRPD into this legislation, my concern is that if we want to make every provision of the UNCRPD directly applicable in our courts, there is a mechanism set out in the Constitution in respect of how to do that.  There are two steps: we sign up to an international law and then we incorporate it by a full Act of the Oireachtas.  Respectfully, the Deputy may be taking a shortcut in that regard.  I can see what he is seeking to do but the significance of giving every provision of the convention direct application in our courts is big.  That is why it took us a long time to make that call in terms of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We did it.  A step of that magnitude requires the parliamentary scrutiny that such a step would bring.  Obviously, the courts can, do and will make reference to the provisions of the convention when they are dealing with issues in this area.  We are already seeing the influence of the convention in terms of the courts' jurisprudence in certain cases relating to deprivation of liberty.  That is a positive thing.

There must be no ambiguity on this issue.  Unfortunately, there will be such ambiguity unless a specific amendment is added to copper-fasten the right of presumption of capacity and the importance of will and preference.  Independent Living Movement Ireland was clear on the need for the Bill to provide for the presumption of capacity and the protection and promotion of a person's will and preferences.  It called for specific reference in the legislation in respect of the aim of legislation to ensure the autonomy of disabled people to live the lives of their choosing.  The issue is that, under the current legislation, the decision support services were able to draw up draft codes of practices that allowed a wide range of actors, including legal practitioners, financial professionals and healthcare professionals, to carry out assessments of capacity as they see fit.  Those individuals can then make decisions regarding whether to respect the decision of the relevant person based on their assessments and without any recourse to or oversight by the courts.<\/p><p>The draft codes are a separate but related matter.  Numerous stakeholders raised concerns in this regard.  The key, however, is that the codes and their implications for the rights of disabled people and others were possible under the 2015 Act.  Without amendment, there is the potential for a large number of unqualified people to make assessments based on an individual's capacity.  The Minister may disagree with that interpretation.  Even if he does, however, the key point remains that there is scope for interpretation of what needs to be a cast iron right.  The law should operate from the position that all individuals have capacity unless it is proven otherwise, in a manner similar to the presumption of innocence in the legal system.  The amendment is designed to guarantee the recognition of capacity and proportionate protection of that capacity.  The Minister is aware of the shortcomings of the 2015 Act in respect of presumption and the protection of capacity.  The amendment addresses that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#J00900","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The amendment is also in the name of Deputy Ward.

Section 8(1) provides: \"The principles set out in subsections (2) to (10) shall apply for the purposes of an intervention in respect of a relevant person, and the intervener shall give effect to those principles accordingly.\"  Section 8(2) provides: \"It shall be presumed that a relevant person who falls within paragraph (a) of the definition of &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; in section 2(1) has capacity in respect of the matter concerned unless the contrary is shown in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"  It is important that the 2015 Act that we are amending does contain a presumption of capacity.  That is set out in the legislation at the moment.  As all present are aware, that does not currently apply because that legislation has not been initiated, but that is our starting point.  When the Bill is passed, that will be the starting point.<\/p> <p>  I am not in a position to accept the amendment because, as drafted, it does not align with the overall architecture of either the 2015 Act or the Bill.  It would require significant policy and drafting work to give it effect because the functional model that we are seeking to create through both the 2015 Act and to initiate through the Bill is central to the fabric of the 2015 Act.  The fundamental restructuring this amendment represents would make the Bill basically unworkable and that would prolong the abolition of wardship.  I think all present agree that wardship needs to be removed.<\/p> <p>  Beyond that technical element, I do not see the need for the amendment at a policy level.  It appears to be based on an assumption that the functional model is not compliant with the UNCRPD on the basis that section 3 does not specifically identify the right to hold and exercise legal rights and obligations.  I know that argument has been summarised in the past as the idea that the 2015 Act equates mental capacity with legal capacity, but I do not think this is the real implication or action of the 2015 Act.  Taken as a whole, the Act and the Bill provide for the component parts of legal capacity in a way that is compliant with the UNCRPD and has significant and robust safeguards taken on board.  The place of the functional capacity model in the Act is designed to maximise a person's decision-making capacity in a manner that explicitly privileges and provides a framework to enforce and safeguard the person's explicit will and preference.   This is contrary to the prevailing system of wardship.  Assisted decision-making will allow a person to hold and exercise legal rights and obligations.  I appreciate the intent of the amendment.  I do not think examining section 3 in isolation is helpful in assessing the Act's overall compliance with the UNCRPD.  The manner in which the Act as a whole operationalises the functional model is CRPD-compliant and meets the requirement of both Article 12 of the CRPD and general comment No. 1.<\/p> <p>  On a final point, the term \"best interpretation\" that is used in the amendment is not a term that is used elsewhere in the 2015 Act and it is unnecessary, given the application of the will and preference that is set out in the guiding principles of the Act.  We think that approach gives better legal clarity on the issue as is currently set out in the section.  For that reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#J01200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"vote","time":1655161200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 4; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#J01300","aye":["1449","1514","1469","1627"],"nay":["1570","1519","1601","1562","1511","1477"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;(3) The Minister shall include disabled people in all consultations on the Act according with the State&rsquo;s obligation under Article 4.3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.&quot;.&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#L00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Section 5 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>SECTION 6<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;(1) Section 8 of the Principal Act is amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):  \t&quot;(1) The principles set out in subsections (2) to (10) shall apply for the purpose of all interactions in respect of a relevant person, and persons shall give effect to those principles accordingly.&quot;.&quot;.  <\/blockquote> <p>The amendment is related to amendment No. 7.

They all relate to costs.  Enormous extra expenses are faced by people with disabilities that are not covered by social welfare programmes.  Not all people with disabilities are on social welfare.  Many people with disabilities are working.  People with disabilities are at a higher risk of poverty.  It is important to minimise the costs of the decision-making supports in the Bill, so as not to risk further impoverishment of people with disabilities.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 15 is along the same lines.  The donor is a person who makes an enduring power of attorney.  This section relates to regulations that the Minister could make, including setting the fees that should be charged.  Similar to the thrust of other amendments, I ask that the means of the person are considered when setting fees.  The person should always be at the centre of the legislation and the Minister should not be allowed to make regulations on fees without taking a person's means into account.  The proposed subsection (e) allows for circumstances in which fees can be waived.  Therefore, I recommend that the amendment would be accepted to ensure that this is taken into consideration.  Subsection (3) states that the Minister should take into account the need to ensure protection of the assets and funds of the donor.  I ask that we would take this a step further and explicitly state that the person's means would also be taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#L03400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I understand the thrust of amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 15, which seek to consider the means of the person and the financial burden imposed when setting fees and charges for co-decision-making and EPA arrangements under the Act.

It is not intended that any additional financial burden is placed on the user of the Act's provisions.  The various fees and charges under the Act were established in line with international standards.<\/p> <p>  I think Deputy Ward alluded to the fact that it is not necessary to means-test in this way as the director does have discretion to entirely waive fees.  That will be set out in the regulations that will be brought forward under this Act.  All fees are subject to consultation and approval with the Minister in my Department or are prescribed directly by the Minister.  I am very conscious that cost should not act as a barrier to accessing the provisions of the Act.

The amendments seek three-month and 18-month periods, respectively.

This means that individuals who wish to confer powers to consent to or refuse health treatment to a trusted supporter, at a time when they are no longer able to communicate their wishes, will have to complete a separate advanced healthcare directive, even if they are also making an enduring power of attorney.  This places an additional bureaucratic burden on the relevant person, if that person is required to draft two separate instruments with different requirements for supporting evidence, witnessing, etc.<\/p><p>It is especially burdensome if the relevant person wishes to authorise the same person who holds the enduring power of attorney as his or her designated healthcare representative to consent to or refuse treatment on his or her behalf, in accordance with his or her will and preference.  It would also be inconsistent with the approach in the rest of the Act to exclude healthcare treatment from enduring powers of attorney, when decisions about healthcare treatment can be included in any other decision support arrangement under the Act, including decision-making assistance agreements and co-decision-making agreements.  It is also inconsistent with the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which recommends that health and medical treatment decisions should be retained in the scope of an enduring power of attorney.  That was pre-legislative recommendation No. 52.<\/p><p>The amendment would also restore the original power which the present Bill proposes to remove from individuals making enduring powers of attorney.  We argue that the removal of this power is unnecessary for the Minister's stated purpose of giving clarity to healthcare professionals who have the authority to make a healthcare decision where a person lacks capacity.  Sections 12 and 20 of the principal Act clarify that when a person makes a decision-making assistance agreement or a co-decision-making agreement that relates to healthcare, such agreement will be null and void, as respects decisions also covered in an advanced healthcare directive, if that directive enters into force because the person has lost capacity.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is already foreseen in the principal Act that in situations where one or more decision-makers may have authority in respect of powers, for example, to consent or refuse health treatment, the advance healthcare directive and designated healthcare representative take precedence over other instruments.  This provides the necessary certainty to healthcare professionals on what instrument to follow in this situation.  Therefore, there is no need to remove the option of individual choice from donors of enduring power of attorney, who should be able to continue to confer these powers in their enduring powers of attorney, should they wish to do so, rather than imposing a bureaucratic burden or creating a separate legal instrument with separate witnessing and notification requirements to give effect to their choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#M02200","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>This amendment deletes the Minister's proposal to remove treatment decisions from enduring power of attorneys, EPAs.  Separating decisions about healthcare treatment and enduring powers of attorney will create additional complications for individuals.  In essence, if someone wants to plan his or her healthcare decisions in advance, he or she would have to create not one but two instruments, which are an enduring power of attorney and an advance healthcare directive.  These would then necessitate two separate requirements for supporting evidence, witnesses for each instrument and separate assessments of capacity to make both instruments, since capacity is to be assessed in a decision-specific manner under the legislation.<\/p><p>It was pointed out to us that these types on instruments would need to be put in place soon after a life-changing diagnosis of dementia, for example.  Now, the Government is forcing people to go through two processes.  It is useful to quote from the pre-legislative scrutiny report on this issue:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe most widely opposed measure in relation to Enduring Power of Attorneys was the proposed removal of treatment decisions. This proposal received widespread criticism.  DPOs, legal experts, advocacy organisations and others argued that this would be less accessible, more complex and inefficient.  It was put that it will discourage people from using EPAs and increase costs, as those who wish to have the full range of their advance wishes protected will have to make two arrangements: an EPA and an AHD. <\/blockquote> <p>Why is the Minister complicating the issue?  People directly affected and advocates have highlighted this move as creating obstacles for people.  Some people may want to create separate enduring power of attorneys and advance healthcare directives and the law should allow that, but it should not force everyone down a more complicated route against their will.  If this Bill is serious about respecting people's preferences, it needs to empower people and not force them to jump through additional hoops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#N00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>As the Deputies noted, the Bill proposes to change the role of an attorney under the Act.  The reason for this is that it is considered necessary to give clarity on medical legal decision-making.  Amendment No. 14, which is being spoken about here, proposes to re-include treatment decisions as part of the role of enduring power of attorney.<\/p> <p>  We consulted significantly with the Department of Health on this and the view is that the appropriate place for medical treatment decisions lies with advance healthcare directives, AHDs, and designated healthcare representatives.  While I accept that in some cases this will require some additional administration by the relevant person and the decision supporter, the importance of the clarity here should not be underestimated.  The removal of treatment decisions from EPAs ensures that there can be no ambiguity between decisions included in EPAs and those included in advance healthcare directives.  This clarity is really important to medical professionals treating relevant persons with a registered advance healthcare directive, particularly in cases where either urgent or even life-or-death decisions are required.  The supporting statements of an AHD alongside the explicitly health-focused role makes a designated healthcare representative the appropriate decision supporter in such a situation.  The DSS can and will work to reduce any administration from this process.  It is important to state that it is possible for the same person to act as an attorney and as a designated healthcare representative.<\/p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Whitmore's question, the reason for the change is to give absolute clarity in some of these life-or-death situations where the potential of two documents saying different things could cause real confusion to a medical practitioner having to make a determination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#N00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>There are other jurisdictions in which individuals have the option to confer health powers in an enduring power of attorney and create separate advance healthcare directives.

Even though Part 8 is under the remit of the Minister of Health, the requirement in the provision is for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to consult with the former in commencing the review process.  It would be more appropriate to review the functioning of the Act as a whole.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 31, as Deputy Sherlock noted, those who campaigned for the legislation argued specifically that a comprehensive review clause was necessary to ensure it would remain under ongoing review at regular intervals, given the pace of change in this area globally and advances in practice.  Therefore, I recommend adding further provisions to ensure the Act is reviewed at least every three years.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 32 is interlinked with amendment No. 31.  It would make more sense to align the reviews of this legislation with those of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Mental Health Reform's human rights analysis of the draft heads of this Bill, which we received last October, states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tPersons subject to the 2001 Act, NGOs, mental health professionals and a range of other stakeholders have been frustrated with the delays in reviewing and subsequent implementation of proposed reforms to the legislation.  The delays are regrettable given the need to urgently address the serious deficits in safeguarding the human rights of persons subject to the legislation.  The authors note that in 2011, the then Minister for Health, James Reilly, and the then Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health, Kathleen Lynch, established a Steering Group on the Review of the 2001 Act.  This was to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to review the 2001 Act.  The ERG was subsequently appointed to make final recommendations on the reform of the 2001 Act.  The work of the ERG published in 2015 was informed by the recommendations from the Steering Group, which published its report in 2012.  It is disappointing that it took 6 years before the Heads of Bill were published earlier this year (July 2021).  S.75 in the Heads of Bill provides that the Minister for Health will undertake a review of the amending mental health legislation not later than 5 years after its commencement.  S.75 provides that the review will assess the effectiveness of the changes introduced and the Minister is required to make a report to each House of the Oireachtas of their findings and conclusions resulting from the review.  The authors are similarly concerned with the delays in the commencement of the 2015 Act.  S.93 of the 2015 Act commits to a review of Part 8 on AHDs before the 5th anniversary of its commencement, while s.146 provides that the Minister for Justice in consultation with the Minister for Health will review the functioning of the 2015 Act (other than Part 8) before the 5th anniversary of the date of enactment of this Act. <\/blockquote> <p>I could go on, but I will leave it at that.<\/p><p>I will deal with those separately.  Amendments Nos. 31 and 33 cannot be accepted.  While I understand their intention is to be inclusive provisions and to ensure a robust review, they would actually have the unintended consequence of restricting the review to only those matters stated.  The review provisions must be broad enough to address whatever issues may come up at that point in terms of the operation of the Act.<\/p><p> Likewise, amendment No. 32 cannot be accepted.  I cannot guarantee that we would be able to undertake a review of the two Acts at the same time.  It is an issue that came up earlier.  I am seeking clarity as to when the Bill on the 2001 reform Act will be passed and will become an Act.  I cannot commit that the reviews of two pieces of law, one that has not been drafted yet, will be undertaken at the same time in a three, four or five-year review.  What we can do is to ensure that whatever review of this legislation takes place, if there are recommendations that are relevant to other pieces of legislation, they can be implemented at that time.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 29 seeks to include subsequent reviews after the initial five-year period.  Most pieces of legislation have a review period but I am not sure how appropriate it is to have a rolling review.  At that stage, we might be looking at entire amending legislation or something like that, and stakeholders can identify whether there is a need for review.  Particularly in the context of this legislation, we have to remember that IHREC has a specific monitoring role, so that gives some security.  There will be a review after what is now a period of five years but IHREC will be undertaking regular monitoring.  That may indicate problems and some issues may come up even before the first review, given IHREC&rsquo;s monitoring role.  I do not think the rolling provision is necessary.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 30 seeks to include Part 8 in the review.  I can confirm to members that I will be bringing a Government amendment forward to address this matter to ensure the review of Part 8 will be included in the overall review of the legislation.  I agree that a coherent and comprehensive review is desirable and we have agreement from the Department of Health on that point.  We are not able to accept this particular wording but we will see that Part 8 is reviewed as part of the overall Act, which is an important step forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#P02100","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I will withdraw my amendments with leave to resubmit them.

While updating of the Juries Act 1976 is welcome, the current wording needs to be improved.  It needs to be amended.  We presume when the Bill refers to mental or intellectual incapacity rather than capacity that that is a typo, as Deputy Sherlock mentioned.  However, even the language \"mental or intellectual capacity\" is inconsistent with the 2015 Act, which deliberately does not include any reference to specific cognitive impairments.  Disabled Women Ireland has pointed out that this type of language focuses on the person's impairment and how it may be difficult for them to participate.  It does not recognise or place any onus on the State or the Courts Service to reasonably accommodate them to participate.  Similarly, Joe McGrath, committee member of the National Platform of Self Advocates, summed it up so well when he said people with intellectual disabilities should not be ruled out of being on a jury just because someone thinks they cannot understand what is happening in court.  The Bill presents a paternalistic and medicalised model of disability.  It focuses on incapacities rather than putting forward progressive laws and associated supports to assist disabled people to participate in juries.  This amendment replicates the approach proposed in the Law Reform Commission's 2013 report and was suggested by the Centre for Disability Law and Policy, NUI Galway, during pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#R00500","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 both seek to change the form of wording referring to a potential juror.  It is worth stating that the policy of and legislative responsibility for the Juries Act 1976 rests with the Minister for Justice, and the relevant section of the amended Bill has been brought forward jointly by me and the Minister for Justice.  Section 82 of the Bill was introduced to remove the prohibition on persons serving on a jury who, in the problematic word of the then section, has or had a mental illness or disability and is receiving medical treatment or is a resident in a hospital or similar institution.  The intention of the Bill is that capacity to sit on a jury be assessed on a functional capacity basis.  The proposed amendment No. 34 seeks to replace the wording introduced in this Bill.  The amendment proposes to make a person ineligible for jury duty if he or she meets the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act 2001 and is resident in an approved centre.  Amendment No. 35 proposes to make all persons in hospitals or similar institutions by reason of ill health ineligible for jury service, where additional supports will be inadequate to facilitate the role of juror.  While I recognise the goal of the amendments, I do not believe they are practicable in the context of the Juries Act and I think their wording is problematic.  Amendment No. 34 runs contrary to the operation of the functional capacity test, whereby the ability to sit on a jury, even for someone receiving treatment under Part 4 of the 2001 Act, should be assessed in a manner presuming capacity and that is time-bound and context-bound.  Similarly, the supports alluded to in amendment No. 35 are part of the broader operation of the functional test, whereby people's decision-making capacity will be facilitated and supported to the greatest extent possible.  In fact, amendment No. 35 could have the unintended consequence of potentially disqualifying a person on grounds of physical health where no such provision currently exists or is desired.  All persons should be eligible for jury service where the court is satisfied that they have capacity to fulfil the duties of a juror, which warrants the use of the functional capacity test to allow the court to assess their eligibility at the time of service.  For those reasons I cannot accept this pair of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#R00600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 35:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 62, to delete lines 28 and 29 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo; &ldquo;A person who, arising from his or her ill health, is resident in a hospital or other similar health care facility or is otherwise (with permissible and practicable decision-making supports and reasonable accommodation consistent with the right to a trial in due course of law) unable to perform the duties of a juror.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#R00800","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Section 82 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Section 83 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>SECTION 84<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 36:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 63, to delete lines 2 to 42, to delete page 64, and in page 65, to delete lines 1 to 6. <\/blockquote> <p>The rationale for removing section 84(1) is that it unnecessarily singles out the National Disability Authority, NDA, as it already has the power to share information with IHREC and it would be more appropriate for IHREC to engage directly with disabled people at grassroots level.  Section 84 amends the National Disability Authority Act 1999 to add specific recognition of the NDA in supporting IHREC to perform its functions as proposed in this section.  This is unnecessary as the NDA's existing legislative functions already allow for the sharing of information, including statistical data, with public bodies such as IHREC.  It would be more appropriate to amend the IHREC Act to create an obligation on IHREC to engage meaningfully with disabled people directly rather than the NDA as a public body in order to obtain information and advice as to how the rights of disabled people are being impacted as grassroots level.  IHREC has already taken steps to achieve this, including through the creation of its disability advisory committee, but further direct engagement with disabled people would be more appropriate in this context than providing legal recognition for the role of the NDA.  The Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has also called for such an amendment to ensure wide consultation with the disability community.  That was pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation No. 64.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#R01300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Before I address the Deputy's amendment, I wish to say I may table further amendments to this section to deal with the pension provisions of staff of the NDA.  These are being discussed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 36 proposes to delete section 84 of the Bill in its entirety.  This section makes amendments to the National Disability Authority Act 1999.  I wish to split this up into two elements.  The first element results in maybe a misinterpretation of what is being attempted here, and this came up in quite a few of the Second Stage speeches.  Section 84(1)(a) a provides that the NDA will be obliged to provide advice and statistical information to IHREC in the conduct of IHREC's role as the national monitoring body for the CRPD.  A decision has been made that IHREC will be the monitoring body.  All this section seeks to do is to facilitate the disability support service, DSS, to be able to give them information.  There was some suggestion that the provision obliges IHREC to engage in consultation with the NDA at the expense of persons with disabilities or disabled persons' organisations.  That is an incorrect interpretation of this provision.  The actual effect is to oblige the NDA to assist IHREC with the provision of expert advice and statistical data.<\/p><p>It is not a consultation provision and it certainly does not imply any exclusivity in terms of consultation.  Both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and the National Disability Authority, NDA, can, should and do engage in extensive consultation with persons with disabilities.  We have discussed some of that issue with the NDA's disability support service, DSS, already.  I propose to bring forward a provision to offer greater guidelines there.  However, I want to stress that a change to the scenario is neither the intention nor the legal effect of this provision.  The deletion of this provision is undesirable, because this provision, as drafted, will assist IHREC in performing that body's functions.  It will allow the NDA to do that.<\/p><p> In addition, amendment No. 36 proposes to delete the remainder of section 84 of the Bill.  It is not clear to me what is objectionable in the remainder of section 84.  This section provides that the staff of the National Disability Authority will become civil servants of the State.  It sets out the necessary technical amendments for that to occur.  Staff of the NDA are currently public servants, so the proposed change is a largely administrative one.  It will introduce administrative efficiencies and savings from a HR perspective.  I do not see what is objectionable about that.   I hope I have clarified this about the first part of section 84.  As well as this, if I were to delete the rest of section 84 on the NDA, there would be an impact on NDA employees.  Therefore I cannot support this amendment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#R01400","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want to add anything else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#S00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#S00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 37 has already been discussed with amendment No. 3 and is in the name of Deputy Sherlock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#S00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Can I speak to that amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#S00600","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>It has already been discussed in the second grouping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#S00700","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#S00800","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>That was so long ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#S00900","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 37:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;In page 65, line 2, after &ldquo;subsection (8)&rdquo; to insert the following:   \t&ldquo;and, in so doing, to have particular regard to its obligations under Articles 4(3) and 33(3) of the Convention&rdquo;.&quot;  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022061400002#S01000","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Section 84 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655161200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>SECTION 85<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 38 to 40, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.

Right now, the target is 3%.  We are meeting that target.  We are at 3.1% across the public sector.  These numbers will get us to 6% by 1 January 2025.  They have not been pulled out of the air.  They have been set out in the comprehensive employment strategy, CES.  I think that the CES document was introduced in 2015.  The State has been working to this document's policies to increase the number of people with a disability who are in employment generally, and not just in the public service.  One of the elements of the CES was to take the existing statutory requirement of 3% and to increase that to 6%.  The CES sets out steps to achieve that.  The percentages that Deputy Ward has set out do not have the strategy and the plan set out in the CES to achieve them.  I do not think that we could achieve them.  We will be pressed to get to the 6% by the start of 2025 as it is.  While ambition is important, I do not believe in setting unachievable numbers just for the sake of doing so.   If we get to 6% by the start of 2025 we will have doubled the percentage of people who are employed in the public sector.  That will be a positive development.  We can look to grow it further, as I think we should.  Whoever is in this role at that stage will hopefully do so.  The figures that are in the Bill are figures that are based on the comprehensive employment strategy.  That is the strategy everyone is working towards.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been very engaged in it.  She and I met with the chair of the comprehensive employment strategy, Fergus Finlay, just last week.  We discussed the sustained efforts that need to be made to increase the employment rates of persons with disabilities generally, as well as in the public service.  I think that it is going to be tough to get the figures that are set out in this Bill.  I will be working very hard towards them, as will my Department.  I want to see the entire public infrastructure do so.  However, we will be pushed to get to 6%.

I am the lead caseworker on the migration services team of the Irish Red Cross.  To give some context to my role on the team, the Irish Red Cross is tasked under its mandate as an auxiliary to the Government to co-ordinate offers of support from the public, to support the placement of refugees into accommodation and to support the social integration of refugees at community level.<\/p> <p>  The strategic goal of the programme is to enable refugees in Ireland to integrate into Irish society and achieve their potential.  The Irish Red Cross has been providing support in this regard to the Government since 2015 to assist in the fulfilment of its EU commitment to promote the resettlement and integration of refugees under the Irish refugee protection programme.  In addition to the cohort of Ukrainian people with whom we are currently working, the migration services team also works with numerous people from Syria and Afghanistan and supports community sponsorship programmes.<\/p> <p>  The migration services team has been working in co-ordination with the Government and partner organisations to assist in the Irish nation&rsquo;s response to the war in Ukraine.  The caseworker team provides active casework support to Ukrainians in Ireland through the matching of suitable accommodation and providing support to essential needs, such as access to medical support, social welfare and education, where required, in association with relevant Departments.<\/p><p>Regarding the purpose of today&rsquo;s meeting, when discussing education and supports provision for displaced Ukrainian students, my main questions will be raised from a caseworker perspective, and will be influenced by the experiences I have witnessed with my clients.  The main struggle I have seen evidenced among parents in Ireland is finding suitable access to school places in Ireland.  With many schools already at capacity and with waiting lists, not all Ukrainian children have easy access to Irish education.<\/p><p> Access to additional language support and English lessons will ease much of the tension felt by students who have been thrown into a new learning environment in a foreign language but it would be my<\/p><p>recommendation to extend these supports within schools to include parents also.

As members of the committee are aware, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body.  It was established in 2004 under the Ombudsman for Children Act with two core statutory functions.  One is to promote the rights and welfare of children up to 18 years of age, and the other is to examine and investigate complaints made by or for children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals that have, or may have, adversely affected a child.<\/p> <p>  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office notes figures published by the Department of Education on 6 June which indicate almost 7,000 Ukrainian children have been enrolled into the Irish education system.  We welcome the action by the State in providing supports for children and families under the temporary protection directive.  We also welcome work by school communities, NGOs and community organisations in supporting the inclusion and integration of children who have fled Ukraine into our communities and education system.  We especially welcome efforts to support unaccompanied minors who have arrived into Ireland from Ukraine without a parent or guardian, which we understand totalled 146 children at the start of June.  <\/p> <p>  We want to talk briefly about curriculum provision.  We note exemptions from studying the Irish language are being issued in line with existing Department of Education guidance in Circulars 0052\/2019 and 0053\/2019, which we understand are currently under review.  This means that children arriving from Ukraine under the age of 12, who do not have significant learning difficulties as detailed in the circulars, may not qualify for exemptions.  We suggest that children may benefit from a more flexible approach to Irish language exemptions, and we have recently engaged with the Department in this regard.  We have been assured that any changes to this circular would include consideration of the best interest of the child and we hope that will be reflected in practice.  As we know, children under the age of 12, for example, may benefit from additional time in their school day to adapt to studying English as an additional language, or for work in supporting their movement to a different national curriculum.  <\/p> <p>  On language provision, we welcome the commitments relating to language supports for Ukrainian children in Irish schools, including through the establishment of regional education and language teams, REALT.  We note from the meeting of this committee on 1 June that 724 primary schools and 194 post-primary schools now have English as an additional language, EA, teaching resources, with additional EA support hours allocated based on numbers of Ukrainian children enrolled.  These supports are key to ensuring children who do not have fluency in English can fully enjoy their right to education and they need to be adequately resourced and funded.  <\/p> <p>  We also welcome the publication of information by the Department in Ukrainian.  Going forward, it is important there is not a reliance on children to support communication between schools and their parents or guardians.  We would urge that all efforts are made to help parents and guardians to integrate into school communities, and to help them make informed decisions.  Interpretation and translation services, therefore, should also be provided to schools.  <\/p> <p>  We also welcome the announcement of the summer inclusion programme.  Culturally responsive education supports are important tools in ensuring integration and inclusion.  The use of intercultural workers in schools &ndash; as in Northern Ireland through the intercultural education service &ndash; is an example of good practice in promoting integration of children into schools.  Due consideration should be given by the Department of Education, school boards, REALT and schools to providing culturally responsive supports to children as they transition into the Irish school system.  <\/p> <p>  In relation to psychological supports, I reiterate the OCO&rsquo;s existing position as a strong proponent of the inclusion of therapeutic mental health support and services within all schools.  Under Article 39 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child \"State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of...armed conflicts\". Thousands of children are entering the Irish education system who may have experienced significant trauma, and extensive consideration needs to be given to facilitating psychological recovery.  Children with family in Ukraine and Russia may also be experiencing significant distress relating to the ongoing conflict.  We welcome work by NEPS to support schools, including developing guidance.  However, the complex needs of these children are unlikely to be met by existing staff and resources.  Guidance should be supported by therapeutic mental health support and services within schools. <\/p> <p>  In relation to other issues, we believe there are some matters that require further consideration.  On special educational needs, we welcome comments in this committee by the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Josepha Madigan, regarding students entering schools with special educational needs, SEN.  This includes the involvement of the NCSE in REALT, and work by the Department of Education with the HSE to ensure a joined-up approach.  <\/p> <p>  It is important that language and educational attainment are assessed separately, and schools have adequate resources to support children in both regards in order that children who have special educational needs can be identified and supported.  The provision of special educational needs school places cannot keep up with current demand.  We are concerned that, with significant numbers of children from Ukraine entering Irish schools, there will be an increasing gap between available provision and provision needed.  <\/p> <p>  Finally on school transport, it is important to note that Ukrainian children may, in some cases, be housed in accommodation from which it is difficult to access the nearest school or local community.  This potentially creates a barrier to accessing education.  We would like to understand the status of the grant scheme proposed by the Department of Education to cover school transport costs for children in these circumstances.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to meet today and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Good morning everyone.  I am the assistant director of children's services in Barnardos in the north of Dublin.  I am delighted to be here today.  Barnardos provides front-line services to children and their families.  We work with children and families who have been affected by traumatic life situations such as poverty, abuse, mental health challenges, neglect, separation, bereavement and parental addiction.  We offer a range of early intervention and targeted services in our 45 locations across the country and we work in homes, family homes, schools, early learning and care settings and in the wider community.<\/p> <p>  Since the first Ukrainian families began arriving into Ireland, Barnardos has been identifying opportunities to provide support and lend expertise wherever it is likely to be of direct benefit to these families or to the agencies working directly with them.  This has included proactively exploring how best to respond to the immediate and longer term needs of Ukrainian children and parents arriving into Ireland by liaising with colleagues in Tusla and those within the children and young people's services committee.  We also reach out to hotels and other facilities where large numbers of Ukrainian refugees are being housed to offer our Breath Body Mind programme.  This programme has been shown to be particularly helpful for those who have experienced trauma.  The programme specialises in releasing the impact of trauma from the body.  We also advise schools on how to support the well-being of children by supporting them to feel they are in a place of safety which will allow children to regulate their emotions, learn, and make friends.  It is only when children have a balanced nervous system that they are able to engage positively, learn, and make friends with their peers.  <\/p> <p>  There is a focus on the importance of minimising sensory triggers in schools, supporting a predictable routine, and supporting children with language barriers.  Working with Ukrainian refugees in Dublin Airport and City West assessment centres, Barnardos is developing training with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Our bereavement service is providing training to hotel staff housing Ukrainian families who have been bereaved.  We also hold webinars with guidance for early years educators to support children from Ukraine, and provide resources for there early years educators. <\/p> <p>  Focusing on psychological supports, many Ukrainians who have come to Ireland over the past few months have faced considerable trauma.  This trauma includes fleeing war; death of a family member or parent; being forced to leave their homes and their families homes suddenly; enduring a challenging journey; and entering a new country without speaking the language.  It is important that agencies working with these children, be it for housing, health or education, take into account the trauma they have been through and consider this when designing the help they intend to provide.  As children and families settle in Ireland and the immediate requirements such as housing are met, adequate attention should be given to wider needs, such as psychological well-being.  Schools should adopt a strengths-based approach to Ukrainian children, with a trauma-informed lens.  The children have experienced huge disruption to their lives.  They may be more sensitive and alert to their surroundings and less tolerant to sudden changes.  From our experience, children who have gone through considerable disruption and have been without a routine for some time can find it difficult to adapt to new rules and regulations. Where schools identify children who are particularly struggling, they should be able to refer them to family support agencies, such as Barnardos.<\/p><p>We can work with families and schools to provide them with the support needed to address school refusal or behavioural problems and build structure and routines again, helping children to find it easier to integrate into schools and to adapt to their rules and systems.<\/p><p> Schools should consider what it is like for Ukrainian children from the moment they connect with the school, including when they are in class, and think about how they can make it easier for them to adjust and how the schools can make it a more straightforward process for getting into school, getting through the process and getting used to a new routine and being made feel welcome.  This extends to the school environment &ndash; the layout of the classroom and school, where is the child going to sit and who will sit beside the child - and helping children to be aware of this information before they get there.  We urge the Government to help schools provide a strengths-based approach and that training be provided for schools so that all services working with these families can provide compassionate and considered supports that take into account all the trauma they have experienced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Clodagh Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  I will speak on the further and higher education element of the committee's remit.  I will begin with a little information on what the Irish Refugee Council does.  Removing barriers to access to further and higher education is one of our key pillars.  In recent years, there has been considerable impact and success and State-driven changes to broaden access to further and higher education, which we strongly welcome.  We also administer an education fund each year, which is just about to open.  Ukrainian refugees will be eligible to apply to it.  That is supported by independent donations and in the last year we supported more than 500 people - refugees, protection applicants and Ukrainian refugees - who had inquiries about further and higher education.<br\/><br\/>I take this opportunity to emphasise to the committee that we believe that in addressing the needs of people from Ukraine in accessing education, be they children or adults, the State has a unique opportunity to remove barriers facing all refugees and international protection applicants.  Maintaining a focus on equality of access will be crucial to ensuring we do not, either intentionally or unintentionally, create a tiered system of education access.  In the context of children, we reiterate that we must cherish all children equally.<br\/><br\/>Our recommendations are broken down into three categories.  I will begin by speaking about education for children and make one point on that.  It is to draw attention again to the necessity for equal allocation of resources.  I refer to the report yesterday by Emma O'Kelly of RT&Eacute; and primary school teachers flagging the issue of English language supports being given to Ukrainian children and not to other children from a protection-seeking background.  We must level up, not level down.<br\/><br\/>In terms of our recommendations regarding Ukrainian refugees and all refugees, the first category is the administration of support schemes.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported in mid-May that Ukrainian college students were to get grants and free education.  We strongly recommend that all refugees and protection applicants would be eligible for this.  This is something we have advocated frequently to the Department and to other stakeholders.  That would require a change to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, scheme, the free fees initiative and the student support scheme whereby refugees and all people seeking protection would be eligible.<br\/><br\/>The second recommendation relates to the timing of various supports.  This includes, for example, the Central Applications Office, CAO.  I understand the opportunity to apply has passed.  If students are going to access further and higher education in September 2022, there might have to be a mechanism that allows people to apply to get into university at that date.  In addition, both the back to education allowance, BTEA, and the voluntary training opportunity scheme, VTOS, require a period of receiving social welfare.  For the BTEA it is three to nine months and for VTOS it is six months.  We recommend that if people on temporary protection are going to be eligible to receive those supports, the three-month and six-month requirements be waived.<br\/><br\/>We also have recommendations on ensuring that third country nationals who have fled Ukraine would be eligible for education opportunities.  This is a much smaller proportion of the total number of Ukrainian refugees in Ireland, but they cannot be forgotten.  Work will also have to be done on the recognition of prior learning - we have a report on this - and particularly the recognition of healthcare qualifications.  Our report will be launched later in July.  Work will have to be done on ensuring that adults have access to English language supports.  Education and training boards are doing strong work there, but there will need to be a recognition of proper resourcing, particularly in areas where many refugees are living.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, we believe this is a great opportunity to support not only refugees from Ukraine but also all refugees and people seeking protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nick Henderson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The Library Association of Ireland school libraries group thanks the committee for inviting us to this discussion on educational supports provision for displaced Ukrainian students.  As outlined in our original submission to the committee last month, we believe school libraries have an integral role to play in providing a wide range of curriculum, language, emotional, well-being, psychological and other supports to Ukrainian and other displaced students.<\/p> <p>  A school library is a dedicated space in a school managed by a professional school librarian where all students can feel welcome, learn and grow.  Libraries give students access to supports and resources they otherwise would not have in school and they offer a sanctuary to all students, especially those who may be living in cramped or overcrowded conditions.  Students can gather within the library space both within and beyond the school day not only to learn and cultivate their ideas but also to relax, re-gather their emotions and connect with each other.  School librarians are not constrained by the demands of the curriculum and are therefore perfectly placed to quickly transition their supports and services to meet the particular needs of any student cohort at any point in time.<\/p> <p>  However, only 30 schools in Ireland have publicly-funded school libraries stocked by professional librarians.  These are all part of the junior certificate school programme, JCSP, Demonstration Library Project and all operate in second level delivering equality of education in schools, DEIS, schools.  Several hundred Ukrainian students have joined these 30 schools over the past few months and our JCSP librarians have already introduced a wide range of tailored literacy, reading and well-being support programmes, including multilingual welcome packs, books, dictionaries and other resources in students' own languages, support materials across all subject areas and much more.  Many of our librarians are opening their libraries in the early morning to facilitate students to attend early morning online Ukrainian school classes using library devices and computers, a very important support for the many students wishing to continue their Ukrainian education.  Ukrainian students have been integrated into the wide range of extra-curricular library clubs and societies, and our librarians have organised a range of arts and cultural trips for these students to help them to integrate into Irish society.<\/p> <p>  Supports to wider family members include parents book clubs, facilitating loans, both physical and virtual, to parents and younger siblings, block loans of book collections at local accommodation hubs and so forth.  These supports will continue over the summer months in the form of library summer camps, ongoing library book club meetings, ongoing access to the JCSP libraries' digital library service and introducing students to local youth groups to ensure their continued engagement and entertainment over the summer months.  Plans are already in place for a number of cross-school JCSP library events and initiatives to support Ukrainian students in the coming year, including themed cross-school Narrative 4 story exchange sessions.  All our JCSP librarians are trained Narrative 4 empathy education facilitators.  Cross-school chess tournaments, bilingual creative writing, book clubs, pen pals and other initiatives are also planned.<\/p> <p>  The JCSP digital library service currently provides access to over 42,000 e-books and e-audio books to all students and staff in second level DEIS schools.  The collection includes over 600 titles across 26 different languages, including Ukrainian and Russian.  We are currently working with our platform providers and with Post-Primary Languages Ireland, PPLI, to increase significantly the number of Ukrainian, Russian and bilingual titles available to students.  A collection of over 400 digital magazine titles has also been added which will be available for simultaneous borrowing by all students.  Access to this digital collection is of immense value to our Ukrainian students and we strongly believe that all second level schools and Youthreach centres should be provided with immediate access for all their students.<\/p><p>The school libraries group acknowledges the committee's recognition of the vital importance of school libraries and school librarians in its recent report on leaving certificate reform and we thank the committee for it.  The committee's recommendations in that report are equally, if not more, applicable to the subject of supports for Ukrainian and other displaced students.  We firmly believe that all students, not just those in 30 schools, should have access to a bright, vibrant, well-stocked school library space and to the knowledge and skills of a professional school librarian and that all should have access to a bespoke, professionally curated school digital library service.  We recommend that a national advisory group on school library provision be set up immediately with the key aim of planning for the implementation of this committee's recent recommendation that there be a school library, a school librarian and fully access to a digital library service in all primary and post-primary schools in Ireland.  As an immediate measure, the further expansion of the junior certificate school programme, JCSP, demonstration library project to further DEIS schools and the extension of access to the JCSP digital library service to all second level schools and Youthreach centres should be in place for the start of the 2022-2023 school year.  This could be achieved quite easily and it would be of immense value to Ukrainian and, indeed, all students.  Now is the time to act on putting these provisions in place.  The members of the school libraries group and the JCSP library project will gladly make ourselves available over the summer months to assist with their implementation.  I thank the committee for listening to my statement.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has deferred his questions.

I was reading their statements last night and this morning and it is worth noting the invaluable work they do all year round and the invaluable service they provide for children and for those on the margins.  It should not be just in times of crisis that we acknowledge their work.  The Ministers came before the committee two weeks ago, when we held two 45-minute sessions.  I will make some comments with regard to what we raised with the Ministers.  If any particular person wants to respond, that is fine.  I do not want to put anybody on the spot.<\/p> <p>  There were three main issues.  One was the issue of displacement.  Teething problems have come to my notice.  Of course, there will be such problems in light of the number of Ukrainian refugees and families who have arrived in Ireland but we have seen situations in which children have settled into a school environment and the uniform has been bought.  These children may have seen and heard very traumatic things, they may be worried about family members and, of course, they face the language issue.  I am given to understand that they can then, with very little notice, be moved from point A to point B, with point B being in a very rural setting.  I do not know if the witnesses wish to comment on how that is being managed and communicated to the education system.<\/p> <p>  On a second issue, children with special educational needs may be more integrated or knitted into a school setting because their needs are being met in that school.  Is the system too rigid to accommodate that?  The Minister recognised what I was saying about that having an even bigger impact on a family but I was not convinced that there was sufficient fluidity in the system to allow for that level of education for such young people to be maintained, notwithstanding the difficulties with accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to the last point I wish to make.  A situation like this is going to expose some of the frailties and fault lines in provision for children.  That is good.  We should never waste a good crisis.  If this exposes existing problems within the system as regards education provision and the supports we provide for children, we should rise to that challenge.  However, it has been said and is demonstrably true that there is a dichotomy between what is now being afforded to Ukrainian children and what is being afforded to children already within the protection system.  I agree with Mr. Henderson's point that it should not be the case that we treat Ukrainian children in the way children already in the system are being treated.  If we can provide a greater level of language support for Ukrainian children, then all children should benefit from that higher level of support.  I would not want it to be said of the Irish system that is has one attitude towards - let us be blunt - white Christians on the edge of Europe and another towards those who are not white Christians and not from the edge of Europe.  That is an uncomfortable sentence to have to utter but if that is the underlying suspicion within the Irish education system and among practitioners, it is a very troubling one.  I have experience of being a Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality and I must say that I did not come away feeling that the Department was fit to deal with this entire area.  I was extremely welcoming of the move by the current Government to take a lot of this responsibility away from that Department and to give it to the new Department under the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  That was a very positive move showing a much more humane mindset.  <\/p> <p>  Those are my points.  I mentioned the continuum of education for all children, how it can be managed and the displacement element.  I also mentioned children with special educational needs and how that issue needs to be properly recognised.  My third point was on the exposure of the dichotomy or split in the system between what Ukrainian children and young people are being afforded with regard to language supports and what is being afforded to those already in the system.  I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on that and on how it should be addressed.  I am interested in what any of the witnesses have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#E00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I ask that we stick to the Ukrainian issue.

It is something that can have a significant impact on children, especially children who have experienced trauma.  I refer to a sudden change without information, without choice and without control.  The impact of trauma we see children experiencing is such that they are constantly scanning their environment for threats, constantly uncertain as to what is going to happen next and constantly in a state of high arousal, which has an impact on their physical well-being, their behaviour, their interaction with peers and their relationships with others.  They will also bounce off of their parents' high arousal when they also are not aware of what is happening next.<\/p> <p>  I can refer to a situation in Dublin.  We were reaching out to a group that was housed in one of our regions.  We were trying to provide our Breath Body Mind programme.  We had developed this programme but up to 150 people were then moved quite suddenly within a day or two.  We see the impact of that.  Children who have experienced trauma need safety, security, certainty and stability.  They need to know what is happening next and they need to be made aware of it before it happens.  When you are in a traumatic situation, control and choice are very important to you.  They help you to overcome the sense of powerlessness that comes with trauma.  From the point of view of Barnardos, early information, certainty, security, safety, knowing what is going to happen next and being made aware at the first point of contact what is happening today and what is likely to happen next week and in a few weeks is an absolutely necessity for these children.  Sudden changes, such as being taken out of a school before being taken to another centre and going to another school, retraumatise and retrigger children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Clodagh Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>That was my experience.

If children and their parents who are in a temporary accommodation space will be moving to medium or longer term accommodation at a future date, and if the children are in school and will have to leave that school and go to a different one in future, telling them may mitigate some of the anguish that this will create.<\/p> <p>  I will make two additional points.  I hate to say it, but this phenomenon is not new to us as an organisation in the context of direct provision.  It happens frequently.  It will always exist, particularly if we are not getting on top of accommodation issues.

For the Ukrainian children who have come to County Offaly, there is no SENO.  The gaps need to be addressed.

Among my clients, I have parents who have approached multiple schools &ndash; sometimes upwards of 15 &ndash; seeking spaces for their children in secondary education but who have been told that they have to adapt within, that is, the children will either have to repeat a year or go into a year with a different age group that is inappropriate for them.  My clients are experiencing significant issues with certain years, in particular first year.  No provision is being made to adapt to this situation.  There are children of this age who need to be placed in schools, but there are schools that are restricted in how many students they can have in a class.<\/p> <p>  Now that we are in the summer period, something could be introduced.  For example, exceptions could be implemented that would allow schools to expand their class sizes to accommodate these children.  The summer period is a time when actions should be put in place.  It is a pause during which case workers, supporters and parents of Ukrainian children can get a chance to find appropriate school placements and a guarantee, which would remove the sense of insecurity for the parents and the children.  The same applies to special education access.

It is a question of training in and understanding trauma behaviours and what they look like.  It will not be the same for every child.  Some will look like perfectionists and seem to be doing fine but will be withdrawn, frozen and shut down.  Others will be aggressive, volatile and easily triggered.

It is about providing training for schools, building capacity, upskilling and supporting them in terms of knowing what to expect and how to support these children when there may be upwards of 30 other children in the class to look after.

Part of that is accommodation.  Nobody wants to move children from one place to another but we need to ensure that parents have access to jobs and accommodation.  That is the reason it is done.  It is weighing up what is in the best interest of the children overall and putting in the supports.  The witnesses might comment on what might be needed in a long-term plan from other Departments outside of that integration piece.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to recognise the really positive contribution Ukrainian people are making in the lives of Irish people.

It allows the relationship to level back so that the parent is not dependent on the child to provide translation for things that are beyond his or her responsibility.  It is, therefore, about extending these supports and recognising that supporting children often needs to extend to supporting their extended family as well, particularly around help for integration and access to work and jobs.

I cannot give information on the size of the gaps, if you like, in terms of the specifics.  However, I would say that it is really important to think about service provision or support provision in terms of both a micro and macro perspective.  Teachers in a school who notice that a child is struggling should be able to have a service to which they can refer that child directly for his or her own bespoke support.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, in terms of scope from the macro perspective, teachers should be able to assume there will be support for them in terms of upskilling and learning to provide to the whole classroom and whole group of potentially Ukrainian children who may in turn require support.  Then, in individual schools, there will be an element of support that is necessary, like my colleague, Ms Ward, spoke about, in terms of therapeutic support within the school with which children can be supported.  There are layers of support and meeting all those layers would be a very helpful process with which to start.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the movement of children, I completely agree that nobody intends to suddenly move children.  There is always a reason for it; there is a purpose.  As my colleague, Mr. Henderson, and I said, the important thing here is the \"How\".  It is the time to plan.  There should be an understanding that this is not the place a child will be forever; it is a place where he or she will be for now.  Then, when it comes time to be in the next place, this is what that will look like.  It is setting the path and the journey for children in a way they understand it so they know what they are doing and that while they are in one place, they have what they need at that time.  They have the stimulation support and all their basic needs while they are there, as do their families, but they know what is coming next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Clodagh Carroll"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I wish to comment in regard to the intergovernmental and interdepartmental response.

We all spoke about the pressures with regard to accommodation.  Children need a secure home to start to recover, go to school, have a base and feel secure.  Of course, that cannot be fixed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That needs to have the local authorities and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage sitting at the table.  It is the same with the Department of Education and Department of Health.  It has to be an all-of-government response to meet the needs of these children.

Our librarians have often reported that students have particular aspirations for their careers.

I apologise that I had to leave after the opening statements for a media event.  I agree with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan that the response of the Irish people has been remarkable.  The response from school communities and the schools involved has also been very significant and, by and large, the effort from the education and training boards, ETBs, and the REALTs has been significant.<\/p> <p>  My first question is addressed to Ms Ryan and I raised a similar point with the Minister, Deputy Harris, a fortnight ago.  The point is in regard to non-Ukrainian refugees.  Of course, we need to be doing everything we can to support Ukrainian refugees, but I am concerned.  I instanced an example which provoked me to think about this a bit more myself.  I was visiting Mount Sion school in Waterford and I happened to ask if any Ukrainians had arrived there.<\/p><p>The principal explained to me that he had been ten minutes late because he was introducing two Afghani children to the school.  The challenges and trauma that those children face are not in the slightest bit lesser than those of Ukrainian children.  I was asking about access to SUSI in that context.  I am concerned about supports needed, such as for English as an additional language.<\/p><p> I will put these questions to everyone.  We have heard occasional and, I hope, isolated stories of children settling in a school and then being moved on to another area.  There was one example of a child from somewhere in Dublin being moved to Youghal in County Cork.  Is that still happening?  Is it still the case?  Is that widespread?  First, it is very disruptive and second, it calls for schools to show leniency when it comes to uniforms, books and such, if there will be volatility in terms of placements and so on.<\/p><p> My sense of the REALT teams, at least in terms of my own area, is that they are doing, by and large, reasonably well and that they are working hard.  Obviously, it is a very fluid situation but they are trying to manage as well as they can.  I ask everyone what their experience is of the REALT teams.  Are they satisfied the teams are working efficiently?  What else do they need?<\/p><p> I am especially concerned about a few categories in terms of Ukrainian children and refugee children generally.  One of my concerns is for those who have suffered severe trauma and another is for those with special educational needs.  Another category of children about which I am concerned is that of children who are midway through, or towards the end of, post-primary school and are landing with more or less no English.  They may have time to catch up at an earlier stage in the school system, but if children are in third, fourth, fifth or sixth year and are landing into a school with pretty much no English, they could find themselves very isolated and in a very difficult situation.  I know there are efforts to try to align some of the children with the Ukrainian education system, but it is potentially a very challenging scenario.  I ask Mr. Henderson to start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#H01600","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>In terms of a timeline, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported in mid-May that the Department was considering giving Ukrainian students access to SUSI and providing that they would not have to pay international fees and would be eligible for State grants.

The Minister's assistant came back to us to say our letter was under consideration.  We asked to meet with the Minister.  We hope that will happen in due course because this is an opportunity to make wider changes.  It is a matter of equality and it is something for which we have advocated for many years.

I can speak from the caseworker perspective in that when we are moving a family from temporary international protection accommodation services, IPAS, accommodation, such as Citywest Hotel, we engage with the parents about the area to which they are moving.  We engage with them about what kind of house or property they will be moving to and the school options available within the area.  We then work with the parents to make sure that the child has access and that the correct connections are being made but it most certainly is happening that children are settling and then moving.  We are finding issues with our clients, whereby children have uniforms for a school into which they have settled for one or two months and they are now faced with finding school supplies, new books and curriculum activities and a new path to school and uniform.

There has been considerable demand for that, especially during Covid when people could not access physical materials.

We are adding significantly, with the help of Post-Primary Languages Ireland, to the collection that is available in that library.

However, that should be supplemented with interpreter services in order that parents can make informed decisions and choices about their children's education.  A couple of years ago, we did a consultation with children living in direct provision.  While I know we are speaking about Ukrainian children, the children living in direct provision spoke to us about their experiences of our education system in schools.  What they told us was that they would like for there to be greater intercultural awareness and training for teachers in order that teachers have a greater insight into where children are coming from.  That would help them to integrate into the school community.  It would be very helpful if that could be brought beyond English-language support even though, of course, that support is of critical importance for communication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>It was Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's proposal that we have this round of meetings with both the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, last week and a meeting with the witnesses this week.

I will endeavour to fill that minute well.  This is the central challenge facing our education system at present.  We are talking about 6,000 children arriving and presenting with a very specific, but complex, set of needs.  In trying to get my head around it, I was trying to tease through what my central concerns were in terms of providing the most appropriate education that is cognisant of those specific needs.  I was trying to think my way through the headings.  We have to have an understanding of the children's previous learning.  I am not sure that we are doing so but that question is probably more important to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  The maths curriculum jumps out at me.  If a Ukrainian child arrives into third class in an Irish-context school, does that third-class teacher have an understanding of the similar curriculum in Ukraine and of whether the child will have hit long multiplication or decimals at this stage?<\/p><p>Certainly, as a teacher, I would very much like to have that information at my fingertips.<\/p><p> We have spoken about the inherent trauma of dislocation and about NEPS psychologists.  However, we must acknowledge that we were at and beyond capacity of provision before there was a Ukrainian crisis.  There are specific language needs in the provision of English.  I was in the same school on Monday and was talking to Michael Walsh.  We must acknowledge that Ukrainian students are getting the support where the Afghan or Syrian students who sit beside them are not.  That has to be addressed. <\/p><p> There must be an understanding of the specific context of the Ukrainians who are arriving.  We have spoken a lot about mobility.  They will first arrive into Citywest and then move to somewhere like Gracedieu in Waterford.  As they find their feet in a few months, they will start to make decisions themselves about where in Ireland they want to live.  Therefore we must look at three locations where there are immediate, medium-term and long-term solutions.<\/p><p> As far as I can see, there is an absence of a Europe-wide approach.  If a child first lands in Poland for a couple of weeks - I will ask Ms Ryan to give a Red Cross, international overview in a second - is there any sort of coherence in the provision in Poland or Moldova by the time they arrive in Ireland? <\/p><p> Mr. Henderson and Ms Moran spoke of the medium-term hope that the conflict will cease and these people will return to where they want to be.  The Gaeilge exemption kind of goes to the heart of the matter on this.  Are we considering this medium-term to long-term approach?  I am very much an advocate of teaching the Irish language within our primary and secondary schools but is it a good use of these children's time?  If my child was dislocated and arrived somewhere I would hope that they would have English language and Irish language provision where they arrived.  Are we providing Ukrainian language classes for them?  Are we providing Russian language classes for those from the east of Ukraine who are most affected by the conflict and comprise a proportionately higher number of Russian speakers?<\/p><p> I am wasting the extra minute that the Chair gave me.  <\/p><p> Ms Ryan is a case worker in the Red Cross.  We are more than 100 days into the conflict.  Have we any sense of the actual population flows in Europe?  What pattern is emerging?  When these people arrive in Ireland, as I said, there are likely to be immediate, medium-term and long-term responses.  Are we beginning to see a pattern where Ukrainian refugees find their feet and self-sort themselves to get where they want to go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#J00800","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I will respond in reverse.  I will speak of my experience and the clients I have interacted with.  The system has been put in place in a way that has enabled them to find their feet, having streamlined options for things like medical card support that gives access to healthcare and social welfare, and immediate provision of a PPS number.  These are barriers that we find hugely limiting for the other cohorts of refugees for whom we are working who do not have the same access.  I understand this meeting is to focus on Ukrainian refugees in Ireland but we cannot ignore the fact that the system to support a Ukrainian refugee is set up in a way that has been streamlined, which is not the experience of people from Afghanistan or Syria who the Red Cross supports through active case work and community sponsorship.  It is a very different system and process.  We find that our clients from Ukraine are hitting the ground running because options are available, including around language with translation of documents and so on being available, and the willingness to help is there.  That is an incredible thing and something the Irish people should be very proud of but it is an example of a model that could be adapted to support everyone.  It shows that the system can work and that it can be expanded.<\/p> <p>  On the long-term question, I find the parents I engage with, once they are in accommodation and their children are in school, are looking for work.  They want to actively contribute, settle in and have a normal life.  While it is disruptive and the situation is very difficult and unique, the Ukrainian cohort that we work with are hitting the ground running and settling in at a good pace because of the supports that we can now bolster and strengthen.

Internationally there are some excellent resources led by the UN but I do not know how much that has filtered down.

We certainly facilitate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>If I may add one point on including the trauma-informed perspective in the summer programme, body-based interventions for trauma-informed care are important to include.

A tutor said to me one time that the best learning you will ever do when you are on placement is the learning you have over a cup of tea.  That was 100% right, so I would not say the summer programmes are not learning, because they are.<\/p> <p>  On the Irish language, it should be a choice for all refugees if they want to take it as a subject.  They may not.  People from other countries being left out of that is inequality.  We have seen it happen to Travellers time and again.  You do not do Irish because you are a Traveller and that can put you at a disadvantage.  I wanted to highlight that.  Before I forget, I would love a copy of the report Ms Ward mentioned, if that is possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, was here two weeks ago.  We asked questions and I was told not many people from Ukraine in our schools have disabilities.  I would love a copy of the report in order to be able to do some work around access for children with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  A few years ago, there was a quote that asked who are we to say that a child matters more or less because of the community that child is from.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what the Irish State is doing.  As a member of the Traveller community, I have seen  how Travellers are treated as less and how that can really impact on your life and on the whole community.  I welcome the Ukrainian refugees.  It is important and very positive going forward.<\/p> <p>  I genuinely believe we should treat all refugees who enter the country with the same dignity and respect.  I worked with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and did some voluntary work throughout my ten years of activism.  I was also involved with the Irish Refugee Council.  I think of the amount of lobbying and campaigning for simple things like the PPS numbers.  I can understand how much anger is out there among the refugees.  What we are doing is dividing to conquer, whereas what we should be doing as a society is bringing people together.  I do not see that in sight for us yet, as a country.  Going forward it is about the learning we can implement and what we can do in our country.  While it looks like we are really supporting people from Ukraine - that is damn right, and we should be doing it - people are staying in one bedroom or in hotels.  They have no access.  Again, being a member of the Traveller community, I know how accommodation can have a dramatic impact on your education and your well-being.  You are fleeing a war situation and then you end up in a small room and your freedom is genuinely gone.  We see that with direct provision as well.  We need to tackle accommodation for refugees here.  I have not got the answer as to how we are going to do that.  Of course, this was not planned, and we will do what we can in order for people to be safe.  Nobody is saying otherwise, but earlier I wrote to the Leader of the Seanad to ask when the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, will come to the House for a debate around ending direct provision because it is a year since the White Paper was launched.  I am aware that a crisis has come upon us and how we deal with it I do not know; I do not have the answers to that.  However, I would like to see us end direct provision for people who are fleeing war in Afghanistan and access to education for people fleeing all wars.<\/p> <p>  I have questions.  I apologise to the Chairman; I will ask them very fast.  On trauma and psychological supports, are those supports extended to all refugees?  I have spoken many times in this committee and in the Seanad around the digital divide.  Have we seen that happening with Ukrainian refugees?  Are people getting equal access to digital devices?  What kind of software needs to be downloaded for people so they can access education, be it in Ireland or Ukraine?<\/p> <p>  The most burning issue for me right now is ending direct provision and trying to get people out of hotels as fast as we can and get appropriate accommodation for people.  How do we do that?<\/p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Henderson, it must be very tough for the Irish Refugee Council and the members it works with when they are seeing how one group of people is treated here and how another group is treated.  How is the council dealing with that in terms of access as well?  As Mr. Henderson said earlier, can we spread that out?  Again, we welcome it and it is something I welcome with open arms but how do we spread it out for all people who are fleeing war zones?<\/p> <p>  I thank everyone so much for coming in.  They do brilliant work with all refugees.  I really need to credit them all for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#L00500","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Whomever wishes may go first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#L00600","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  To respond to a few or her points, on psychological supports, for protection applicants a person, under EU law now transposed into Irish law, should receive a vulnerability assessment as to their reception needs.  There is a vulnerability assessment in place.  We have just produced a report on it that we have sent to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  There is a pilot that has been under way for more than a year now.  Our report makes reference to it.  A Ukrainian refugee, because they are entitled to temporary protection, does not have a legal right to a vulnerability assessment.  However, the toolbox, if you like, of the vulnerability assessment could be applied to Ukrainian refugees though, unfortunately, I do not think there is capacity in the existing State services to do that.<\/p><p>We have commented that the vulnerability assessment delivered by the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, in some circumstances can be an empty device, in that the determination given by the assessment does not necessarily have a follow on because of a lack of capacity, resources and so on.<\/p><p> In regard to hotel accommodation, which is an important point, we are here today to talk about education, but where somebody lives is crucial to education.  The Ombudsman for Children and the Ombudsman have criticised long-term hotel accommodation for children growing up in homeless accommodation.  That has a detrimental effect on children.  We know that direct provision has a detrimental effect on children.  The Ombudsman's report on direct provision speaks to that so clearly.  There are now more than 20,000 Ukrainian refugees in State-provided accommodation, the majority of whom are in hotels.  The State's welcome to Ukrainian refugees has been extremely commendable, but I fear that without the implementation of medium- to long-term accommodation considerations, we will be talking in the autumn about them living in hotels for long periods and all the issues that brings.  That will be a ball and chain and will hinder children's development in education.  Unfortunately, much of it flows back to accommodation.  The State's response to Ukrainian refugees compared with people seeking protection is very problematic. That is particularly the case at the beginning, in terms of supports being quickly delivered to one group and not to another group.  The long-term accommodation problems will begin to hinder all refugees unless we take quick action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nick Henderson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I am very interested in the Senator's points.

We work closely with the Department to provide trauma-informed training and support for those working with children and families in direct provision.  We think the same should happen for schools.  The challenges for parents, children and families living in hotel accommodation are under-estimated.  I have seen families who have been in a hotel room day after day, with the sun splitting the sky, who are not able to spend time in the foyer of the hotel.  The hotels are often remote so there is no access to get anywhere else.  That impacts on the ability of parents with two, three or four small children to parent and the child's ability to develop is significantly affected.  In all cases, what needs to be considered is choice, control, opportunity and hope for such families.<\/p> <p>  The sudden movement is a challenge for Ukrainian refugees.

I have a couple of questions.  I spent 15 years as a teacher and I am still in touch with quite a few of my former colleagues.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties schools are having in terms of resourcing capacity to accommodate refugees.  All schools, to be fair, are putting their shoulder to the wheel, and they are getting on with it and making it work as best they can.<\/p> <p>  I wish to focus on education provision and capacity issues in particular.  I am from an area on the north side of Cork city, which heads east towards towns like Carrigtwohill, Midleton and on to Youghal.  The vast majority of secondary schools in those areas were already over-subscribed even before Ukrainian refugees became an issue.  Are there any other pinch-points across the country where there are significant shortfalls in capacity that the witnesses could identify, be it parts of Dublin or other large urban centres?  Where in particular are we struggling to accommodate students?<\/p> <p>  To be fair to Senator Flynn, she mentioned the special education provision.  We are all acutely aware of the issues in that regard.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and I spent three hours at a briefing with the HSE yesterday.  A good chunk of that time was spent dealing with issues related to disability provision and therapies, or the lack of them.  Even if the refugees have an identified need for speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy or whatever the case may be, what is the likelihood that they will get to avail of the support, given the pressures we already have?<\/p> <p>  My third point relates to the Ombudsman's office.  Have there been any complaints and, if so, what is the nature of the complaints?  What are people saying about the educational provision that is being provided so far?  Do the witnesses have any idea how many complaints have been made?<\/p> <p>  If time allows, I will ask one last question about a student's ability to learn.

We hope that will help raise awareness of our office and how we can help.<\/p> <p>  The only issue that has recently arisen is exactly what has been spoken about earlier, namely, schools being able to access English language supports for children that are not from Ukraine.  There are two different systems in place at the moment.  That is obviously a serious concern for our office.  If a direct provision centre has opened in an area or there has been an increase in the number of children coming from different countries, it is important for schools to be supported.  It is not about the pathway to protection.  That cannot be the consideration.  It must be about the needs of the children.  If children need support to develop fluency in English, there can be no discrimination about that.  It must be a children's rights issue and assessing the needs of children.

Parents have contacted upwards of 15 schools looking for places.  Certain years, in particular first year, are completely over-subscribed and the waiting list is prioritised for Irish students with legacies or other situations.  We must have a system that would allow access to secondary education for children, in particular for first year and fifth year.  Children entering into fifth year are trying to think of their future careers and to continue the momentum and the goals they would have had in Ukraine.  We must ensure that access is being provided to the Irish education system and that it becomes more robust to allow them to access schools.<\/p><p>On the Deputy's question on the likelihood of getting access to additional support in cases where a need has been identified, it very much depends on the area in which the child has been placed.  The caseworkers for the Irish Red Cross are trying to gain access to additional supports for a number of children.  It is very much dependent on where the child is placed and the level of advocating that is possible.

There is no use giving the agencies additional resources next November, December, January or February.  The current situation is totally unacceptable and should not be happening.  Children are being pushed into classes that are full.  It is all very well to take everybody and just throw them into classrooms but, in practice, it is not acceptable in my book.

It has been a really good discussion.  As noted, it is about identifying elements that are working well and also areas on which we need to work and focus.  We are looking at a situation in which at least 8 million Ukrainian people have fled their country.  According to a recent report from the UN, nearly 14 million people have been displaced out of a country of 40 million, the second largest by size in Europe.  Ukraine is part of Europe, as are we.  Our response has to meet the demand that is there.  That demand is right now, not in a few months, and the Government is meeting it.<\/p> <p>  There is a whole-of-government approach but there also needs to be an all-agency approach and a whole-of-country approach.  There is a demand on everyone here to step up and see how we can best support the families coming to Ireland.  The question was put as to how other countries are faring.  We know nearly 3.8 million Ukrainians fled to Poland.  I understand some 2 million remain there, with more than 1.6 million having returned to Ukraine.  Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are returning home every day.  However, there remains a huge demand among families who have nowhere to go.  Their homes, towns and cities have been destroyed.<\/p> <p>  The best thing we can do for the Ukrainian children in our education system is, number one, to provide safety.  They need a place that is safe, gets them back into a routine and reduces the trauma they have endured over the past number of months.  We can do the same for the parents and grandparents who are coming here as well, but the number one focus must be on looking after the children.  That is really why the witnesses are here to speak with us today.<\/p> <p>  I am familiar with the great work that is done by each of the agencies represented.  Barnardos staff see the children that are affected on the front line.  They have been tackling the problems that disadvantage children throughout this period.  The organisation has more than 45 service locations.  I welcome that, among all the other things it does, it is providing training to hotel staff who are dealing with Ukrainian families who have been bereaved.  I really like that as it shows evidence of thinking and forecasting far ahead.  There will be a lot to do in getting children back into a routine.  Will the witnesses comment on the importance of establishing routine for children who arrive here?<\/p> <p>  I am aware that the Irish Red Cross's migration services are also working with many other populations besides Ukrainians, including refugees from Syria and Afghanistan.  Will Ms Ryan comment on the importance of the active case work support her organisation is providing to Ukrainians?  Apart from educational support, this will include looking at medical support and social welfare, which requires a cross-departmental engagement with the Government.  Agencies and Departments are working together to ensure we are providing the utmost support to the people who are arriving here.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Henderson give some detail on the Irish Refugee Council's education fund?<\/p><p> I also thank Ms Ward for her contribution.  I welcome that she mentioned the NCSE is part of the regional education and language teams in each of our counties.  Each county is working with the education and training boards and, again, the HSE, which I believe has really come to the fore in many of these areas to support children in finding places and in respect of school capacity.  How important is it that the NCSE is in those regional education and language, REAL, teams?  I ask Ms Carroll to respond first. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022061400002#O01700","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her input and questions.  I will talk about what she mentioned regarding the importance of routine, which ties into everything we have talked about, including safety and security.  When children are traumatised, they need to know what is happening next, and they need to know what part of that is in their day and what their day will look like.  They are always scanning their environment for threats.  Any sense of uncertainty, sudden change or things being different each time can be very retriggering for a child who has experienced trauma, especially a child who has fled a war and left his or her home suddenly.  A sudden movement, a sudden change or any sense of uncertainty can retrigger that, make children believe it will happen constantly and make it very difficult for them to regulate their nervous systems.  Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan asked about when children are able to learn.  It is when their nervous systems are regulated and balanced.  When they are in balance, children can learn, engage and interact with their peers.  Certainty, routine and security are all about achieving that safety the Senator mentioned.<\/p> <p>  An important part of that are the other elements that then come to the forefront, including choice, control, coming back to accommodation, how and where children live and how going to school works.

We are delighted to attend the meeting.<\/p> <p>  A number of reports have identified the impact of substance misuse on families.  These include worry and psychological distress, leading to physical and mental ill-health; exposure to threats and violence associated with drug debts, involvement of a drug-using family member in the illicit market; the financial burden of directly and indirectly supporting the drug user; the impact on employment of stress and caring responsibilities; strain on family relationships; harm from domestic violence and isolation and loss of social life.  The FASN is a dedicated support service for family members or concerned persons who are impacted by loved ones' substance misuse.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the reason for our formation.  The FASN is a voluntary organisation covering the four counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth.  It grew organically from the needs of family members who were impacted by loved ones' addiction and behaviour.  In the north east of Ireland families with a loved one who is addicted to drugs or alcohol do not have resources available to help them understand the impact of addiction or to help them improve their current living situation and coping skills.<\/p><p>Family members are involved at the core of development, management and servicing of the project.  Recognising the importance of the needs of families, the founders of FASN set up peer support groups in the area. The people involved found great strength in the union of their voices.  These groups led to a formal organisation and a network, which today is known as the Family Addiction Support Network.<\/p><p> FASN is led and run by adult family members and volunteer facilitators who have lived experience of addiction.  This peer element is fundamental to FASN as is the training and support provided to facilitators.  The mission of FASN is to assist families in the north east to achieve a greater understanding of addiction, empower them to improve their quality of life and to fulfil a positive role in the recovery of their loved one, should they choose to take it.  FASN has recruited, trained, supported and retained a group of volunteer peers, both men and women, who facilitate peer-led family support groups.  These facilitators meet a trained psychotherapist on a monthly basis for professional support and supervision.  The accredited training, and professional support and supervision provided, are important and valued aspects of the model of peer-led services that FASN has developed.<\/p><p> FASN is guided in its work by the National Drug Strategy 2017 to 2025, particularly by goal 4 which is to support participation of individuals, families and communities; to strengthen the resilience of communities and build their capacity to respond through supported, and promoted structures, at local, regional and national level, and measure the impact of drug-related crime on communities; and to enable participation by both service users and their families through building capacity within the problem substance use sector to develop a patient safety approach, and involve service users and families in decision-making structures.<\/p><p> The FASN service straddles tier 1, which is primary, and tier 2, which is secondary, of the rehabilitation pathway of the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, NDRIC.  The network is fundamentally based on the principles of partnership, community development, inclusion, participation and the empowerment of families who have been impacted by loved ones with substance misuse.  It supports the goals of the national drugs strategy called Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025 and implements goal 3 of the UN sustainable development goals, which is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.<\/p><p> While FASN is about developing services that are based on the knowledge and expertise of the people who are most affected, such as families and communities, they have built strong inter-agency <\/p><p>alliances with other services such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Extern, the HSE, county councils, the Irish Bishops' Drug Initiative and the Family Support National Steering Committee.  In particular, they have developed formal links with other projects in the addiction area, including Turas and the RISE Foundation.<\/p><p> The relationship with the RISE Foundation has enabled our service users to access a ten-week educational and therapeutic programme that supports and encourages them to move towards their own recovery of resilience, and good mental health.  The programme is delivered by experienced and accredited psychotherapists.  The RISE Foundation also delivers one-to-one counselling for family members and-or concerned friends impacted through addiction and runs aftercare.<\/p><p> FASN truly believes that by supporting families to have their needs met they are then able to change the outcomes for themselves.  To do this we create an environment where people can learn for themselves and are supported in the choices that they make.  Of significance, while family members may initially be defined as service users, they often become trained facilitators working with other family members.  This means that families directly have a voice in how services are delivered and managed in a strategic way.  In this way community activism is nurtured and proactive in terms of needs on the ground.  The service implements the goals of the new strategy.<\/p><p> To date, FASN provides the following services: a 24-7 out-of-hours telephone helpline; one-to-one crisis support; a 5-step brief intervention; peer supported groups; access to one-to-one counselling; access to respite care; and an educational programme that is delivered by the RISE Foundation; it also led the way in the north east with the drugs intimidation reporting programme.<\/p><p> The Family Addiction Support Network commissioned its own research and presented findings from a study on how families are impacted by substance misuse in the north-east region of Ireland.  The research was funded by the HSE's community healthcare organisation, CHO8 region, to look at the impact that substance misuse has on families.  On 14 May 2019, the report was launched by the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Catherine Byrne, who had special responsibility for communities and the national drugs strategy.  A key backdrop to the study was the national drug strategy entitled Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, which for the first time included families as service users in their own right.  The study acknowledged the interface between changes in social policy and families.<\/p><p>This study was the first to look at that interface in the context of adult family members affected by substance misuse in the north-east region of Ireland.  The report was largely driven by the narrative of families being valued as experts by virtue of their experience.  It gives voice to the chaos, trauma and distress visited on families impacted by the addiction of a family member.  We had hoped that the key findings of this study would help formulate changes in service provision and practice and would improve the opportunities for families to engage meaningfully in their own recovery and well-being.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to the findings of the report, within the report, families spoke about the psychological and physical ways they had been impacted by substance misuse.  Participants discussed stress, anxiety, fear, not sleeping, feeling sick, not being able to eat, wanting to run away, anger, resentment, frustration, blaming themselves, a feeling of failure, guilt and shame.  Participants were not aware of or able to give voice to their feelings at first.  It was not until they found support, such as contact with the Family Addiction Support Network, FASN, that they began to understand and allow themselves to see what was going on.  Families also spoke about exposure to criminal activity and its impact.  They expressed fear and intimidation and spoke about having to take out loans, getting into debt, being threatened by drug dealers, not being able to sleep in their own houses because of threats, having pipe bombs put under their cars, being threatened with petrol bombs, threats by their loved one who would put massive pressure on the family, having to take out protection and barring orders to have them excluded from the home, the impact on siblings and other family members and on neighbours, villages and local communities, and the link to shame, guilt and stigma.  <br\/><br\/>However, there was considerable frustration at what was seen as sensationalist media reporting on drug gangs and gangland feuds, notwithstanding that this phenomenon is part of the issue.  Participants were keen to correct this balance by reporting their experience of intimidation perpetrated by local drug dealers, who may be drug users themselves and trying to get money to buy their own drugs.  It should be acknowledged that the participants were aware of and had experience of using the drug-related intimidation reporting programme.  This programme is seen as very helpful and its confidential nature is trusted and valued.  The flexibility around the venue and time of meetings was appreciated.  The limits to the programme and the reality of what could and could not be provided was well understood.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to mental health, a variety of studies across Europe have estimated that between a third and half of patients being treated for substance abuse have an independent concurring psychiatric illness.  These findings have been replicated in studies that have focused on cohorts of Irish patients.  Psychiatric illnesses found to concur with substance abuse problems range from anxiety and depressive disorders to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, paranoia, schizophrenia and other mood or personality disorders.  It is possible that a variety of issues lead to comorbidity as described.  Drug use may cause users to experience symptoms of psychiatric illness or may lead to the triggering of an underlying psychiatric illness, sufferers of psychiatric illnesses may use drugs to alleviate the symptoms of those illnesses and both problem substance use and psychiatric illness may be triggered by common factors such as environmental stress or genetic predisposition.<br\/><br\/>I will now move onto substance use and family members.  When responsibility for addiction moved to social inclusion services from mental health services, it was seen as a significant acknowledgment of the many and complex issues involved that required a multi-agency and multidisciplinary co-ordinated response.  However, the mental health expertise required to manage the complexity of dual diagnosis is currently lacking.  When those in addiction experience a psychotic episode while using illicit substances, the mental health services cannot assess their mental health due to the impact of the substances.  Individuals may be referred to an accident and emergency department.  A busy accident and emergency department is not the place to manage a deeply distressed and often fairly aggressive individual.  While there is talk of a national programme and the HSE developing and rolling out a dual-diagnosis programme, we in the north east have not seen this development as yet.  This has implications for a concerned parent or family member bringing an individual for help.  Such people will already be distressed and feeling powerless.  In short, accessing appropriate addiction services in a timely manner causes a great deal of distress and anxiety for family members.  The literature does not recognise the difficulties for families seeking to access comprehensive specialist treatment services.  It should also be acknowledged that there are too few addiction services offering information or support and that those working in these services may have limited training and knowledge to work with family members.<br\/><br\/>On living with addiction in the family, one of the key recommendations in Advancing the Shared Care Approach between Primary Care and Specialist Mental Health Services, a guidance paper prepared for the HSE national A Vision for Change working group, had regard to care and treatment in addiction services.  It stated:<\/p><blockquote>\ti. The effect and impact of alcohol and drug misuse on a person&rsquo;s mental health needs to be highlighted.  The preventive role of the Primary Care Team in this area needs to be supported by training and resources from Specialist Services.<br \/><br \/>ii. Clarity needs to be provided on the organisation, delivery and alignment of substance misuse services to Primary Care and a national standardised model of service agreed and implemented.<br \/><br \/>iii. Strong links should be established with local addiction services as well as links with local addiction support groups such as AA &amp;amp; Narcotics Anonymous etc. <\/blockquote><p>We would include family support groups in that latter point.<\/p><p>The preventative role of the primary team in this area needs to be supported by training and resources from specialist services.  Clarity needs to be provided on the organisation, delivery and alignment of substance misuse services to primary care, and a national standardised model of services must be agreed and implemented.  Strong links should also be established with local addiction services, as well as links with local addiction support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and family support groups.<\/p><p> With the onset of Covid-19, the additional pressures of lockdown had a really negative of families living with addiction.  Families often found themselves in lockdown with the individual in addiction and homes became a pressure cooker.  The families were unable to utilise or have access to other interests and outside distractions which may have helped them keep their mental health stable.  However, FASN did not stop its work, and adapted appropriate general data protection regulation, GDPR, guidelines to establish an online platform to support the service users, whose needs were greater than ever.  FASN secured training to work an online Alcatel-Lucent Rainbow platform to deliver its supports.  One of the most remarkable achievements of 2021 was that the level of service provision was maintained and, in some services, increased, and that no family or family member who contacted services for support was turned away.  This was down to the incredible dedication of the volunteer staff facilitators, who believe that the service they provide is essential for the emotional, psychological and physical well-being of families impacted by addiction.<\/p><p> On funding, the network receives funding from the northwest regional drug and alcohol task force and the HSE of &euro;7,500 per annum and some small once-off funding from statutory services to run particular aspects of the service.  However, no core funding is received to ensure the continuance and expansion of the service.  This funding was secured nearly 18 years ago, when FASN was in its infancy.  The network has grown exponentially since then.  FASN was very dissatisfied to receive confirmation, in January 2022, that it was not successful in the tendering process with the HSE to provide supports to families in counties Louth and Meath.  This is despite a long history of providing cost-effective, evidence-based supports using a peer-led approach and utilising accredited counsellors to provide one-to-one support.  In partnership with the Rise Foundation, we also deliver a ten-week family education and recovery programme twice yearly.  FASN is ultimately about empowering families by providing opportunities to move out of the chaos of addiction into their own recovery, positive well-being and good mental health.  This is consistent with the vision set out in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025.  In keeping with this strategy, family members are not only involved in service provision but are involved deeply in service development.  We believe a vital opportunity to continue to implement best practice while proactively responding to needs has been severely impaired because of the ongoing lack of core funding.  Organisations such as FASN and the Rise Foundation have invaluable experience and expertise in working with families and require appropriate funding to maintain this life-transforming work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022061400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Sloan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Devine to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022061400002#E00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it today.  Since 1989, Tabor Group has been providing support and care to hundreds of people from all backgrounds and circumstances.  We welcome people from all over Ireland.  We are based in Cork.  We offer residential treatment services and community-based addiction treatment programmes to men and women over the age of 18 who are struggling with addiction to alcohol, drugs and gambling.  We have two residential addiction treatment centres.  Tabor Lodge is situated in Belgooly, close to Kinsale.  We offer a primary residential treatment programme there.  At Tabor Fellowship treatment centre in Cork city, we offer a new programme, the integrated recovery treatment programme, which I will expand on later.<\/p> <p>  Providing practical support to families and loved ones of clients who are in treatment is a cornerstone of Tabor Group&rsquo;s approach.  We provide this through our dedicated family support service.  We have a continuing care programme for people who have been discharged from residential programmes that provides ongoing treatment and support to clients that have completed treatment programmes and are learning to cope with the demands of day-to-day living and the management of their addiction.<\/p><p>In addition to this we are also developing community-based treatment programmes.  That is a relatively new initiative intended to reach out to people whose need for treatment is not sufficiently severe or demanding to require access to the programmes offered in the residential settings.<\/p><p> Treatment programmes at Tabor Group all have the following features: they are all client focused and trauma informed, and they adhere to national protocols, including the HSE national protocols for drug and alcohol services.  We have a variety of treatment approaches, all of which are person centred and include person-centred counselling, 12-step facilitation, motivational enhancement therapy, cognitive behaviour counselling and mindfulness-based practices.  The treatment programmes are supported by the HSE with an annual service level agreement and by all the major health insurers.  Tabor Group is accredited by CHKS and has achieved ISO 9001 certification.<\/p><p> In 2021, we received more than 1,000 calls from people seeking support.  We completed more than 300 initial assessments and admitted more than 200 people to our two treatment service centres.  On average, we get five calls a week from family members and loved ones who are seeking support.  In 2021, 16 people attended our new community-based programme and four of them went on to attend residential programmes.<\/p><p> Alcohol continues to be the main challenge for those seeking help from Tabor Group.  In 2021, 49% of the people who were admitted to our programme cited alcohol as the main substance of addiction.  We are seeing continued growth in the numbers presenting with poly-addiction, which involves addiction to many substances.  Alcohol is usually central but illicit substances are part of the addiction profile of more people attending for treatment, especially those aged between 18 and 35.  Last year, 32% of those who accessed treatment at Tabor Group said alcohol and other substances comprised the profile of their addictions.  Many of our people also have mental health challenges.  We talk about dual diagnosis programmes.  Tabor Group will be a part of the roll-out of dual diagnosis programmes which are rolling out in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 this year.<\/p><p> Tabor Group has shown great resilience over the past two years in coping with the global pandemic.  With commitment and resolve, we continue to serve our clients.  We did more than just weather the storm.  As for others, Covid-19 presented significant challenges for the organisation but thanks to the staff, volunteers and funders of Tabor Group, including the HSE, Pobal, the Probation Service, Cork City Council and others, we rose to the challenges.  Working together and with support from the Mercy Hospital in Cork, we were able to keep our residential treatment services open and Covid-free.<\/p><p> Over the years, Tabor has continued to evolve and develop its services to meet the changing needs of people.  Following extensive research, planning and preparation, and under the leadership of our senior counsellor, Mr. Con Cremin, in 2021 we introduced and completed the first full year of our integrated recovery programme at Tabor Fellowship.  This is a milestone for the Tabor Group.  It involves us offering a 12-week residential programme that is open to both men and women who have complex needs, including mental health challenges, poly-addiction, cross-addiction and a history of previous treatment and relapse, as well as challenges relating to coping and living skills.  A younger profile of people are accessing this treatment programme.  Accommodation needs are also a strong feature of people requesting help from this programme.<\/p><p> We have developed a treatment manual which outlines every aspect of the service we deliver in our programmes.  We are also developing new policies in response to emerging client needs.<\/p><p>In the last couple of years, we have forged a partnership with the adult continuing education department at University College Cork, UCC, to deliver a certificate in continuing professional development, CPD, in responding to problem gambling.  We have also partnered with other UCC departments, namely, the department of applied psychology, department of public health and epidemiology, and department of adult continuing education, as well as Munster Technological University's department of social science, to provide teaching inputs on their programmes and joint research projects.  We are in the process of developing a Tabor Group research agenda at the moment in partnership with these institutions and others.<\/p><p> Tabor Group is embedded in the local community in Cork and in the HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 area.  We enjoy excellent working relations with the HSE drug and alcohol services under the leadership of Mr. David Lane.  An annual section 39 service level agreement has been in place for several years.  Tabor Group is an active member of the Cork local and southern regional drug and alcohol task forces.  We work closely in partnership with community-based hubs, which refer clients to our services for treatment.  We work together with other agencies for effective case management so that people do not fall through the cracks, particularly when they have completed their residential treatment episode.<\/p><p> Nationally, Tabor Group is committed to playing its part in achieving the strategic priorities of the national drug and alcohol strategy entitled Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025.  We contribute to the objectives of enhancing access to services, developing integrated care pathways and responding to the needs of disadvantaged communities and those with drug-related offences.  We are also committed to evidence-informed and outcome-focused practice.<\/p><p> Tabor Group seeks to be at the forefront in the development of effective drug and alcohol services to meet the emerging and complex needs of clients and their families.  Central to this is the development of evidence-based, trauma-informed addiction treatment addressing the complex needs of those struggling with addiction in a safe, residential and community environment through programmes delivered by trained and registered counsellors and psychotherapists.  Tabor Group seeks to be a learning community where research and training for the next generation of practitioners in the field of drug and alcohol services goes hand in hand with offering excellent and effective treatment support for a growing number of people and their families.

The system is in the process of being rolled out.  It is a very important initiative.  It is part of the reason that the Tabor Group was started in the first place.  Sr. Margaret from the Mercy Hospital noticed 30 years ago that there were an awful lot of repeat visits.  Many people were frequently in hospital but the underlying issue that was bringing them there was not being addressed.  In a way, it is going back to Tabor's roots.

One of the points in the opening statement about the local nature of the issue is very interesting.  Sometimes we tend to think of it as very gang-driven but often the actors on the ground, while they may not be our immediate neighbours, they are local people and we may know their families know them and they would know the families.  It is very hard to extricate oneself from that when intimidation is happening.  I have two questions on that.  I will stick to my two questions.

They are all encouraged to take part in that.  We operated a drugs course with the Probation Service as well.  The approach has been to nip it in the bud especially with young people.

That is a policy that they use.  It is a practice that is there.  I suppose it is a business method they use to get young people, and it is the families then that are left with the debts, which are never paid off because they can say it is &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000.

It is very hard to crack down that way, but if we all work together and have joined-up thinking then we can make progress.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the point that was made about the recent cocaine report.  One good thing that I got from it is that for the first time ever there was a decrease in smoking.  It just goes to show that if the Government and all the Departments work together, they could turn things around with addiction, the same as they did with the smoking revolution, and make it a priority in a health-led approach instead of a criminal one.  Who would ever have thought that the smoking campaign would be successful, yet here is proof of it?

My background is that I have worked for years in addiction services as a key worker.

What comes first; the chicken or the egg?  Does the addiction come first or does the mental health issue?  Drugs can often give calm and a sense of peace to an anxious person.  They work for a certain time until they become a problem as well.

I agree 100% that accident and emergency is not the place for anybody with mental health or addiction issues.  The hospital closest to me is Tallaght Hospital, where there is a 20-hour wait for accident and emergency.  If someone has a physical issue that is fine but if someone has a mental health issue or addiction issues, the wait of 20 hours for treatment is barbaric.  What would the witnesses like to see instead of that kind of system for people with mental health and addiction issues?  What would work for out-of-hours?

An important part of the answer to the Chairman's question relates to the process being counsellor-led.<\/p><p>There should be well-trained and registered counsellors.  These are people with built-in self-care mechanisms and that is very important.  Staff should not get swamped by client needs and should be able to look after themselves.  We are good at looking after staff too.  There should also be performance management processes and professional development of staff.  We are good at looking after staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022061400002#Z01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Devine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I will come to the Family Addiction Support Network but I have a final question for the Tabor Group.

Relative to the other group we are well funded with the service level agreement we have with the Probation Service and the city council, as well as the funding we receive from private insurers.  It is always a concern and a worry, and it affects our ability to travel in confidence.  We have been here and we will be here a long time.  It is about having resources comparable to what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  As I said, people are providing services in the health system around cardiology or stroke care and those services can be relied on because they are properly funded.  They can retain the best people possible.  We do that but it is not something of which are fully confident because of the vagaries of the way public funding goes.  We would like that process to be on a more sustainable footing, although we are grateful for what we have relative to what others have.  We work really well with our partners, who are also subject to the variations in public funding.<\/p> <p>  The Government should prioritise this as a firm part of the health service and have a funding line commensurate with the need that exists and the work that needs to be done in order for people to be able to access services at the point they need them.  We must be able to support them and their families inside and outside of treatment and beyond.  It should be sustainable and it is probably the most important aspect of this.  As I said, we are not complaining because we know that relative to others we are publicly funded but it would be great not to worry about the money for the energy bills.  We know we will manage and we always do but it would be good if that was not a worry.  We would prefer our worries to be simply about the people in the treatment programme and their families.  We would like to put our energy into that.  I am not sure doctors in Cork University Hospital worry about the electricity bills; they worry about doing a good piece of surgery, which is correct.  We would like to be in the same position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022061400002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1655161200,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I will ask the same question of the other group.

We should be able to keep that suite of services that we have for families the whole time.<\/p><p>I would want us to have the same programme, support and supervision and the facilitation of our continuum of care.  The Chairman spoke about burnout.  All our fundraisers who did Trojan work last year are burned out this year and we have no fundraisers left for this year.  I would like our services to be embedded in the community and to be funded properly in order that we can do this work.  Our programme can be rolled out nationally.

Within the communities we serve, we are all vying for funding.  We are all minding our own little projects and there is a sense other providers should not be looking at our projects or they would not be getting ours.  I have enjoyed and learned a great deal from the place-based leadership programme that has been run through the Drogheda implementation plan.  It builds leaders through a more inter-agency, collaboration and shared learning approach.  That has been terrific in building trust and openness between groups on the ground.  That is something I would like to see rolled out nationally.  I would love there to be a regional unit for each region in Ireland because it is very hard for family members and people in addiction to travel with all the expense that would involve.  Ms McKenna spoke about our support network being embedded in the community.  If we knew it would be sustained into the future, we could relax and let it take its natural course.  If it is not, as she said, that is 21 years of infrastructural relationships, trust built up within the community, and the Chairman will know how long it takes to build that up within the community, and training wiped out in a heartbeat, along with our relations with the families.  It is very important to have an inter-agency approach where we all support each other.  This engagement has been beautiful today and I have learned a great deal from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022061400002#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jackie McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":738,"content":"<p>And <i>vice versa<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022061400002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Kelleher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":739,"content":"<p>If we had an inter-agency shared learning approach, consider the resources we could have and it would save the Government a fortune, but it can only happen if people feel it is safe to share, to trust and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022061400002#BB00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jackie McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655161200,"counter":740,"content":"<p>I note Deputy Buckley is here and he is another Cork person.
