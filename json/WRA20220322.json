for people with a disability, Employability, will now provide grants directly to those who qualify.<\/p><p>- An increase to the Wage Subsidy paid to employers who employ people with a disability from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 an hour, thereby encouraging more employers to employ people with a disability.<\/p><p>- An increase in the Capital\/Savings disregard\u00a0for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from

examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.\u00a0 The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021.\u00a0 It established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Report takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; and an examination of international approaches.\u00a0 The Commission also undertook an extensive consultation process designed to encourage as many people as possible to have their say on sustainable State Pensions arrangements into the future. \u00a0The submissions to the consultation are available on the Pensions Commission website at pensionscommission.gov.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s report set out a wide-range of recommendations in relation to the State Pension system and Social Insurance Fund, including recommending legislative provision to align retirement ages in employment\u00a0contracts\u00a0with the State Pension age. <\/p>  <p>  Successive Governments have committed to supporting older peoples&rsquo; continued engagement in economic and social life, including in the National Positive Ageing Strategy (2013), the Report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Fuller Working Lives (2016) and the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023 (2018). \u00a0Building on the work of these previous groups, the Pensions Commission supported measures to facilitate and encourage fuller working lives.\u00a0 The Commission also fully supported Government commitments to facilitate employees remaining at work past the prevalent contractual retirement age of 65 if they wish to. <\/p>  <p>  The Government agreed in October 2021 that the Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations would be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection and also to the Commission on Taxation and Welfare for its views.\u00a0 That Joint Oireachtas Committee published its views on the 2nd February 2022.\u00a0 The Commission on Taxation and Welfare also submitted its views on the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s PRSI related recommendations at the end of February.\u00a0 These various views will be considered carefully as part of our deliberations over the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.\u00a0 My officials are currently examining each of the recommendations and in this regard are consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.\u00a0 I think it is really important that we complete that work and get those views before reaching conclusions on any one\u00a0recommendation such as the recommendation to align retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension age.\u00a0 In this regard, I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government in April.<\/p>  <p>  As the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland,\u00a0the State Pension very effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.\u00a0 This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the

<\/p><p>-  The combined worth of these payment to fuel allowance recipients is &euro;325, which is the equivalent of almost 10 weeks of the Fuel Allowance payment. <\/p><p>-  Furthermore, due to the

(Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1), the Government extended the Social Welfare Acts to provide for entitlement to illness benefit for

the extent to which it restricts them from taking up employment, their means and their habitual residency.\u00a0 If the required documentation is requested and is not submitted within the allotted timeframe it may result in a case being disallowed in the initial stages. \u00a0If the missing documentation is later supplied the case is reviewed and may be subsequently awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Any unfavourable decision of a Deciding Officer (DO) is communicated in writing to the claimant setting out the reasons for the decision. \u00a0It is open to any person to request a review and or an appeal of any statutory decision made by my Department and any new evidence or information provided to my Department will be considered as part of this review or appeal.\u00a0 It is important to note that any decision of a DO can be revised in light of additional evidence without it ever being in the appeal process.\u00a0 This can result in several reviews being carried out on a single application and several disallowances being counted against a decision which is then ultimately allowed.<\/p>  <p>  Our operational areas continuously seek to optimise their processes for applicants and have taken a number of initiatives to try and encourage applicants to provide all relevant information with their application at the outset.\u00a0 One of the most important initiatives in this regard was a redesign of the DA application forms which included clearly highlighting the information that needs to be submitted with the application in order to expedite the claim process and in order to minimise the number of disallowances. \u00a0The redesign was carried out with input from representative bodies and advocacy groups via the disability consultative forum.\u00a0 The new DA application form was recently put into operation and my Department is monitoring the improvements arising from the redesign.<\/p>  <p>  I would encourage all people who apply for Disability Allowance, or other Social Welfare payments, to provide as much information as possible with their application so that their claim can be decided at the earliest date possible. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200057#WRB06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social

the employment of people with disabilities in respect of the Disability Allowance, the Blind Pension, the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Reasonable Accommodation Fund grants.<\/p><p>Regarding the Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension, Budget 2022 introduced an\u00a0increase of &euro;25 per week in the\u00a0earnings threshold from &euro;350 to &euro;375.<\/p><p>Currently, when an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.\u00a0 In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350\u00a0are also disregarded for the purpose of the means test.\u00a0 Earnings above &euro;350 are assessed at 100% - this means that for every euro earned above &euro;350 a euro reduction is applied.<\/p><p>The increase in the earnings threshold means that from June 2022, only earnings above &euro;375 are assessed at 100%.\u00a0 As a result, people on Disability Allowance and Blind Pension will be able to earn more and keep more of their disability payment.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 also increased the general weekly means\u00a0disregard entry point for Disability\u00a0Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60.\u00a0 The effect of this\u00a0measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to\u00a0&euro;5.10 per week for Disability Allowance recipients who have means.\u00a0 This measure also brings the general weekly disregard\u00a0for the Disability Allowance in line with that\u00a0of the Blind Pension.\u00a0 This measure will take effect from June 2022.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 provided for three of the Reasonable Accommodation Fund grants to be made available to people with disabilities and their employers through EmployAbility contractors in 2022.\u00a0 These grants were previously only accessible through the department&rsquo;s Intreo offices.\u00a0 The three grants are the Workplace\u00a0Equipment\/ Adaptation\u00a0Grant, the Job\u00a0Interview\u00a0Interpreter\u00a0Grant and the

to be available through the network of Intreo centres.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 also provided for an increase in the Wage Subsidy Scheme&rsquo;s basic hourly rate (Strand I subsidy) from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 in January 2022.<\/p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme is an active labour market programme that targets private sector employers and\u00a0is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the\u00a0provision\u00a0of financial incentives (a wage subsidy). <\/p><p>The increase in the Strand I subsidy will have an impact on the amount of Strand II subsidy as well.\u00a0 In situations where an employer employs between 3 and 6 employees, a Strand II 10% top-up is applied to the hourly rate, increasing the payment rate to &euro;6.93 for each employee.\u00a0 In the case of an employer who has more than 23 qualifying employees, the payment rate is &euro;9.45 per hour for each employee.<\/p><p>Currently there are 1,506 employers availing of the subsidy in respect of some 2,376 employees.<\/p><p>My\u00a0Department continues to keep the range of income and employment supports\u00a0under review.\u00a0 Any changes to the current system would need to be

<p>The Household Benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.\u00a0 The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.\u00a0 The package is also available to some people under the age of 66, who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.\u00a0 My Department will spend approximately &euro;273 million this year on HHB.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2022 the estimated cost of the gas and electricity element of the package is &euro;203 million and will benefit over 479,000 households.\u00a0 The gas and electricity element is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to enhance or increase the electricity and gas aspect of the package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.\u00a0 To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure measures to a total of over half a billion which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.<\/p>  <p>  As part of these measures, I was delighted to announce an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 that was paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment.\u00a0 It is expected that this additional lump sum will cost an estimated &euro;49 million.<\/p>  <p>  Other significant measures announced by the Government include the\u00a0Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment\u00a0which is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent rise in electricity prices.\u00a0 The scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and supervised by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, will be paid in addition to the gas and electricity element of the HHB package to qualifying households.\u00a0 Approximately 2.1m households will benefit by &euro;200 each from the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The combined worth of the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment and the additional fuel lumpsum payment is &euro;325 or the equivalent of nearly 10 weeks of additional fuel allowance or over 9 months of\u00a0additional HHB payments.\u00a0 I have also announced that the Working Family Payment budget increase announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from June to April this year.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, due to the continuing rise in inflation and as part of the economic consequences of the tragic conflict in Ukraine, the Government recently reduced excise duty on fuel.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department also provides Exceptional Needs Payments which may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.\u00a0 Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the

earnings&rdquo; approach, aims to ensure that the relative value of welfare payments compared to market earnings would be maintained\u00a0over time and that, in the short-term, the real value, or purchasing power, of these payments would be protected.<\/p>  <p>  This commitment was reiterated in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion which also outlined a potential approach for benchmarking and indexing pension rates.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Pensions Commission report also examined the issue of benchmarking pension rates and has endorsed implementation of the &ldquo;smoothed earnings&rdquo; approach.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations of the Pensions Commission are being considered.\u00a0 I intend to bring proposals to Government in April in relation to these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  I am\u00a0acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.\u00a0 To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government announced a package of measures in February, costing in excess of a half a billion Euro.<\/p>  <p>  These measures include\u00a0an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 which\u00a0was paid last week to households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment.\u00a0 This\u00a0lump\u00a0sum payment\u00a0is intended to target the most vulnerable social welfare recipients to protect against rising fuel costs.<\/p>  <p>  This payment, in addition to the Budget increase to the Fuel Allowance, will\u00a0mean low-income households see an increase of 41% in their fuel allowance payments this season compared to the last season.<\/p>  <p>  A further measure to help with energy costs is an Energy Credit of &euro;200 to be applied to electricity accounts for all households.<\/p>  <p>  The increase of &euro;10 to the weekly income threshold of the Working Family Payment will be brought forward, now taking effect from early April 2022 rather that than from June.\u00a0 For those in receipt of more than a minimum payment on the Working Family Payment, the &euro;10 increase in all earnings thresholds will result in an increased payment of &euro;6 per week.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to those introduced as part of Budget 2022, which provided for the largest social welfare Budget package in 14 years.\u00a0 In January, around\u00a01.4 million people received a &euro;5 increase in weekly payments, and more if they have dependents.<\/p>  <p>  There were also a number of targeted measures designed to support those most vulnerable to poverty, including increases in the rates of qualified child payments and the Living Alone Allowance.\u00a0

credits.\u00a0 Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.<\/p>  <p>-  The Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme - The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).\u00a0\u00a0The Scheme,\u00a0which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to\u00a0be disregarded (from 1994), can have the effect of increasing a person's\u00a0Yearly Average.<\/p>  <p>-  HomeCaring\u00a0Periods &ndash; HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 covered by a paid or credited social insurance\u00a0contribution\u00a0(regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years.\u00a0 HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Aggregated\u00a0Contribution Method (also known as the Interim\u00a0Total Contributions\u00a0Approach) of pension calculation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>-  Since April 2019, all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and the Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.\u00a0 The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>-  Foster parents are entitled to the benefits of the Homemakers Scheme or HomeCaring Periods, on the same basis as other homemakers, and will qualify if the carer is in receipt of Child Benefit.\u00a0 If the foster parent is not in receipt of Child Benefit\u00a0s\/he can still qualify for the Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme or HomeCaring Periods provided the caring periods are confirmed by TUSLA (these are cases where caring is for a short period of time).<\/p>  <p>-  It should be noted that if\u00a0a person\u00a0does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s\/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).\u00a0 Alternatively, if his\/her spouse is a State pensioner and has significant household means, his\/her most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on his\/her\u00a0personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>-  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.\u00a0\u00a0My officials are examining each of the recommendations and\u00a0consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.\u00a0 The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare have submitted their\u00a0views on the recommendations.\u00a0 These various views will be considered carefully as part of the Government's deliberations. <\/p>  <p>-  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions on any one\u00a0recommendation,\u00a0such as\u00a0the recommendations related\u00a0to long-term carers.\u00a0 In this regard, I intend bringing a holistic recommended response and implementation plan to Government in April.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0hope this clarifies the matter for the

self-employment from a social insurance perspective, especially in State-funded agencies or in areas in which public monies are being spent; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>One of my Department&rsquo;s roles is to ensure the correct class of PRSI is being returned for individuals, in order to protect their PRSI contribution record and future welfare entitlements.\u00a0 We must also ensure the correct flow of funds into the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  To begin with, it is worth noting that there are approximately 340,000 self-employed individuals in Ireland, the vast majority of whom are genuine entrepreneurs operating their own businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The term 'bogus\u00a0self-employment' is a provocative one that\u00a0implies falsehood and a deliberate attempt to commit fraud.\u00a0 However, false\u00a0self-employment\u00a0does not always involve a deliberate or fraudulent misclassification of an employee. \u00a0Sometimes it happens that both\u00a0employer\u00a0and employee are genuinely mistaken in their approach and are happy to correct the position once the Department&rsquo;s officials make a determination.\u00a0 Accordingly, it\u00a0is clear that the misclassification of employees for PRSI purposes can occur through a lack of knowledge or error or due to changes that occur over time in the relationship between an employer and its contractors.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it is really important that\u00a0employers\u00a0and workers have clear information and guidance when looking at\u00a0employment\u00a0status.\u00a0 That is why I put great value on the\u00a0Code of Practice on Determining\u00a0Employment Status.\u00a0 I published a revised version of this Code last year ensuring that it reflects both the modern world of work, and the relevant legislation and case law that has emerged from various court cases over the years.\u00a0 I would encourage all affected stakeholders to make sure they are familiar with its content.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that there is no compelling evidence that false\u00a0self-employment\u00a0is widespread, as some might suggest.\u00a0\u00a0That said, it does exist and, as such, is a matter that I and the Department take very seriously.\u00a0 I do not want to see a situation where any workers are denied their social insurance entitlements or where much-needed funds are denied to the Social Insurance Fund.\u00a0 Therefore, I want to be very clear that,\u00a0where it does occur, the deliberate misclassification of a worker as a self-employed contractor for PRSI purposes, in a situation where they are actually working as an employee, is wrong.\u00a0 That is why the Social Welfare Consolidation Act contains specific offences in relation to the return of\u00a0employment\u00a0contributions which, on conviction, can result in fines and\/or imprisonment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There is no &lsquo;silver bullet&rsquo; solution that would completely eradicate false\u00a0self-employment.\u00a0 The primary way to deal with it is through inspection, compliance and deterrence.\u00a0 My Department's Employment Status Investigation Unit (ESIU) is a team of Inspectors with the sole objective of investigating false self-employment.\u00a0 Since it was established in late 2019, the unit has investigated over 500 employers.\u00a0 Additional resources are currently being allocated to both investigation and decision-making units in the Department to increase efforts in this area.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the ESIU, there are approximately 380 Social Welfare Inspectors appointed nationwide who carry out work across the various social welfare schemes.\u00a0 This includes engagement in a programme of employer inspections nationwide in which they investigate employment status as part of their more general duties.\u00a0 More than 100 of these Inspectors are members of the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit who work specifically to detect social welfare fraud.\u00a0 My Department&rsquo;s Inspectors also work jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  This Government takes the issue of false self-employment very seriously.\u00a0 A new working group, to be chaired by Minister English, to review false self-employment was recently announced by the T&aacute;naiste.\u00a0 This will bring my Department together with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, the WRC, Revenue and various social partners representing both workers and employers to examine this area to see what further measures may be possible.<\/p>  <p>  If someone has any individual concerns of false self-employment or bad practice in this respect, they can provide my Department with the details and investigators will be more than happy to review the employment.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the

sector employers to employ people with disabilities and thereby increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.\u00a0 The scheme provides financial incentives to private sector employers to hire people with a disability for between 21 and 39 subsidised hours per week under a contract of employment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I increased the basic rate of subsidy\u00a0by &euro;1 to &euro;6.30 per hour giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;12,776 per annum based on a 39-hour week.\u00a0 Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with disabilities who are supported by a Wage Subsidy Scheme Strand I payment.\u00a0 It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a<\/p>  <p>  disability.\u00a0 Therefore an employer with 3 to 6 employees, gets a 10% top-up applied to the hourly rate bringing it to &euro;6.93 and rising to &euro;9.45 per hour where an employer has more than 23 employees.<\/p>  <p>  The WSS is a demand-led scheme and participation was negatively affected by Covid-19.\u00a0 Currently there are 1,506 employers availing of the subsidy in respect of some 2,376 employees.\u00a0 It is notable that 62 new employees have\u00a0taken up employment\u00a0under the scheme since

time.\u00a0 However, I believe that the increased rate paid to employers will encourage more mainstream employers to employ or increase the numbers of people with a disability in their work force.\u00a0 Most employers will agree that the new rate is a substantial contribution to the employer&rsquo;s wage costs and this measure has immediately benefitted all current employers on the

Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) is a key policy initiative under the Government's new national employment services strategy; Pathways to Work 2021-2025.\u00a0 WPEP is a funded work placement scheme to provide work experience opportunities for\u00a0up to 10,000 jobseekers who are unemployed for more than six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP).\u00a0 Participation on WPEP is entirely voluntary.\u00a0\u00a0All participants are paid &euro;311 per week plus any social welfare increases for qualified adults and children.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>As of 11<sup>th<\/sup>March 2022, 276 participants have been approved for a placement on WPEP, with 174 currently participating and 20 placements are approved to start shortly. 29 participants have completed the 6 month programme\u00a0with another 51 participants\u00a0finishing\u00a0early due to a variety of reasons, including 19 who found employment while on the programme.\u00a0 There are 108 WPEP opportunities currently advertised on JobsIreland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Of those approved 45% are male and 55% are female.\u00a0 The Sector with the largest percentage of WPEP placement(s) for those approved is Health and Social Work at 19% followed by Wholesale and Retail Trade at 17%.\u00a0 The largest age cohort are those under 30 years of age which accounts for 50% of participants. <\/p><p>The cost to the Exchequer since the programme commenced is &euro;1.153m.<\/p><p>The scope of the work experience on offer for each placement is reviewed in advance to ensure that the roles are training and learning opportunities consistent with the objectives of the programme.\u00a0 To assist participants to achieve the requirement for 20 hours accredited training work, a new WPEP Work Placement award\u00a0designed and delivered by the Education and Training Boards is available to participants.All host organisations must also demonstrate that they can provide supervision and mentoring to participants and Case Officers liaise with\u00a0the host and the participant to ensure progress is being made by the participant in the personal learning plan agreed with the host.The Case Officer is also available to provide advice and support to both the host and the participant during the placement.\u00a0<\/p><p>As the economy and labour market continues to recover from COVID, work is ongoing to encourage take-up on this programme by employers and jobseekers.\u00a0 A particular focus is on jobseekers whose previous employment has not returned post COVID - who will require support to reskill and retrain to find new jobs, at times in new sectors.\u00a0 I am pleased to see that post COVID labour market trends and unemployment levels are much more positive than had been forecast.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the

Benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.\u00a0 The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.\u00a0 The package is also available to some people under the age of 66, who are in receipt of certain welfare type

Department, recent Budget spending increases have been targeted to ensure that it goes to those people who need help the most. Therefore, as well as increasing Social Welfare payments weekly rates, the Government has increased the rate of targeted &ldquo;household&rdquo; based schemes such as the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance.\u00a0 These supports are targeted towards households that are at a higher risk of poverty, as evidenced by recent ESRI research.\u00a0<\/p><p>HHB is only one of my

recipients\u00a0by\u00a0assisting them with\u00a0the cost of communications and\/or home security solutions.\u00a0 The primary objective of the TSA is to support the most vulnerable people at risk of isolation, including the elderly and those with disabilities, to have access to critical communications infrastructure.\u00a0 In order to receive the allowance, a customer of\u00a0the

products from third countries in which no sanctions apply but for which tariffs apply.","asker":"1514","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware,\u00a0the European Union imposed Safeguard Measures on steel imports into the EU in July 2018 in response to the United States applying a 25% tariff on steel imports originating from 3rd Countries, including the European Union. As a result of the US Measures, there was an increased risk of steel originally destined for the US market being diverted to the EU and thereby distorting the EU steel market. <\/p>  <p>  To address this risk, the EU introduced Steel Safeguards Measures in 2018 for an initial period of 3 years. These measures were extended following a review of the mechanism in June 2021.\u00a0The decision to continue the measures for a minimum period of 2 years was based on a Commission-led review which recommended the prolongation of the measures in order to defend the Single Market against 3rd country steel flooding the market, which could potentially injure EU steel producers across the Union.<\/p>  <p>  The current Safeguard Measures allow for the importation of steel from 3rd Countries by way of quotas, determined in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel before the Safeguard tariff is applied.\u00a0 Thus, traditional trade flows should not be impacted by the ongoing Measures.<\/p>  <p>Additionally, as of the 1st   January of this year a quota-based system on exports of EU steel and aluminium into the US was implemented in place of the 2018 tariffs on all such imports. This system allows all EU Member States to export steel and aluminium products to the US - within traditional trade volumes - without attracting the additional 25% tariff. In response, the EU suspended its rebalancing countermeasures against the US that were imposed in 2018, these rebalancing measures are separate to the Steel Safeguard measures that continue to be applied to third county imports. These joint actions are welcomed but are considered to be incremental steps in finding a permanent solution to the issue of trade in steel and aluminium between the EU and US. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know on the 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation commenced a large scale military invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0As one element of its response, the European Union implemented an import ban on steel products originating in the Russian Federation and Belarus and this action was taken due to the unacceptable and illegal Russian military aggression against Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  In light of these developments, the EU Commission recognised that its Safeguard Measures needed to be recalibrated to take into account changed internal market dynamics due to the ban of imports of steel and aluminium products from the Russian Federation and Belarus. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the EU Commission proposed to Member States to adjust the functioning of the EU Safeguard measures to ensure that these import bans do not create a shortage of supply in the Union and that Union steel users can continue to source those volumes from other third country sources. <\/p>  <p>  The proposals themselves aimed to proportionately redistribute the quota volumes allocated to both countries among other exporting third countries based on the most recent data available to the EU Commission, the overall share of imports from 2021. This approach by the EU is also in line with the logic of the functioning of the measure, as it preserves traditional trade flows in terms of volumes and origins, adapted to the current exceptional circumstances.<\/p>  <p>This proposal has been formally adopted by the European Union and came into force as of 16th   March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to engage with Irish industry and representative groups and liaise closely with EU officials regarding the operation of the safeguard measures to ensure that they continue to meet their objective in guarding EU steel producers from the harmful impact of trade diversion of steel while at the same time ensuring that the EU market stays open to fair and sustainable competition where EU importers can secure supply at competitive prices.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As always, steel sourced within the EU is not subject to any such tariffs as part of the Single Market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200061#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200061#WRF03200"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[13883\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200061#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the total value of dual-use exports to Israel and Palestine for the period of 2017 to date.","asker":"1570","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>&lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items are products and components, including software and technology, that can be used for both civil and military applications.

The latest update was in December 2021 when, as requested by the CCS steering group, Ervia submitted a report &ldquo;Assessment of the Feasibility of CCS for Deployment in Ireland&rdquo; to assess the feasibility of CCS deployment in Ireland against criteria developed by the steering group. In addition, as an EU Project of Common Interest (PCI), included on the 4th EU PCI List, project promoter, Ervia, successfully applied for &euro;1 million in EU grant funding through the EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) in May 2020. Using this grant funding, Ervia is carrying out a further detailed study regarding the transport of CO2 in the Cork and Dublin areas. This includes the network transport and conditioning of CO2 for storage in the Kinsale Head gas field or export via ship to CO2 storage facilities in other countries.

This includes homes that are:<\/p><p>- Awaiting the initial survey of their home;<\/p><p>- Have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor;- Have been allocated to a contractor for works; or<\/p><p>- Currently undergoing works.Activity under the scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic, when construction activity was paused for approximately 12 months in total, in line with Government guidelines. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2021, the average time for a surveyor to be allocated was approximately 18 months. The average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 26 months, taking into account the increase in waiting times due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and the deeper measures being provided under the scheme since 2018.<\/p><p>The following key actions have already been taken:<\/p><p>- The budget for this year, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;- The number of homes retrofitted under the scheme are to increase from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month in 2022;<\/p><p>- SEAI has been allocated additional staff for the Warmer Homes Scheme;- Increasing contractor output through contract management.<\/p><p>Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector and activity did ramp up again towards the end of last year. Based on the foregoing, SEAI target clearing the homes currently on the waiting list in approximately 18 months. This will be done by targeting those homes that are longest on the waiting list first, and then prioritising the worst performing properties, i.e. homes that were built before January 1993 and have a Building Energy Rating of E, F or G.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200063#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200063#WRH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[14577\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200063#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the Exchequer directly or indirectly funds an organisation (details supplied); if so, the cost to the Exchequer of funding the organisation in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[14578\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200063#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the Exchequer directly or indirectly funds an organisation (details supplied); if so, the cost to the Exchequer of funding the organisation in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together. \u00a0142 and 143\u00a0together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department does not provide funding to either organisation directly.

In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have risen and remained high since the second half of 2020. Gas prices are now unprecedentedly high, with UK wholesale gas prices recently reaching record levels. This is a global phenomenon and expert bodies, including the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Commission, have attributed this to a range of demand, supply and geopolitical events, particularly the invasion of\u00a0Ukraine by Russia that has significantly exacerbated the tightening of the European gas market supplies and the consequent upward trend in wholesale gas prices we have witnessed since mid 2020. This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlate strongly with the price of gas. This is an issue across all EU member states. <\/p><p>  The position of successive Governments, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. The best long-term approach to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy, the\u00a0expansion of\u00a0interconnection with our European and neighbouring markets and to deepen internal electricity market integration. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term. This is what Government is working toward.<\/p><p>  In relation to energy efficiency\u00a0the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers a number of schemes funded by my Department including the Communities Energy Grant (CEG) Scheme that may\u00a0be particularly relevant in this instance.

By bringing together groups of buildings under the same retrofit programme,\u00a0these projects facilitate community-wide energy improvements more efficiently and cost effectively than might otherwise be possible.

report supplied are not an area of direct policy responsibility for my Department, the Irish public sector operates within a legislative framework that recognises the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workforce and work environment. This includes polices that promote the rights and inclusion of groups across the equality grounds. Some strategies include specified targets; for example, an increase from 3% to 6% of people with disabilities in the workforce by 2024 (Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities) and 1% of the workforce to comprise ethnic minorities (Migrant Integration Strategy, National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021).<\/p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) as recruiters of staff for the public service play a central role in recruiting diverse talent to take up public service employment opportunities, as outlined in their Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strategy which includes access and the effect of recruitment and selection processes to attract candidates from diverse backgrounds, including the Traveller Community.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to travel costs, the Deputy will be aware that a new suite of measures is being introduced by Government to help with the rising cost of living, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO public transport services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO services every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares; this funding does not include an extension of the scheme to private coach and bus operators. As the Deputy will be aware, unlike with PSO services, the National Transport Authority (NTA) do not set, monitor or regulate fares on services run by commercial operators.<\/p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.\u00a0 This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.<\/p>  <p>  These measures align with our objectives of decarbonisation, decongesting cities, improving liveability, and providing accessibility on an equitable basis which will have a real impact in people&rsquo;s pockets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200064#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dublin Airport Authority","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200064#WRJ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[14039\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200064#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a proposal by the Dublin Airport Authority to impose a drop-off charge for persons being brought to the airport in a private vehicle; if this action requires Government approval; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":475,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that I am aware of the proposal by the daa to impose a drop-off charge.\u00a0\u00a0The daa\u00a0has\u00a0statutory responsibility to operate, manage and develop Dublin Airport and this matter is an operational matter for the company.\u00a0It does not require Government approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200064#WRJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200064#WRJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[14069\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200064#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if it is mandatory to have a government services card to apply for a driver licence; and if he will reverse the policy and allow citizens apply for a driver licence online without the government services card.","asker":"1504","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>It is not mandatory to have a public services card (PSC) to apply for a driving licence.

In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on Public Service Obligation (PSO) transport services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO services every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares; this funding does not include an extension of the scheme to private coach and bus operators. As the Deputy will be aware, unlike with PSO services, the National Transport Authority (NTA) do not set, monitor or regulate fares on services run by commercial operators.<\/p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.\u00a0 This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.<\/p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system particularly in areas which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.

The road options largely follow the existing N20 corridor.<\/p>  <p>  An online public consultation on the possible route options, carried out by the N\/M20 Project Team, had unprecedented public engagement with the closing date for submissions extended by four weeks from the 18 December 2020 to the 15 January 2021. In order to take into account possible changes to appraisal requirements, the assessment work on options continues, with a preferred route to be selected by Quarter 2 of this year and public consultation to follow.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequent to this, work on scheme design and environmental evaluation will be undertaken, in addition to the scheme Business Case, which is required under the Public Spending Code. The scheme Business Case is expected to be submitted to my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in early 2023. Subject to its approval, the submission of statutory documents for the project to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will follow thereafter. TII has allocated &euro;6 million to the scheme for 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply as to the latest status of this project. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200066#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200066#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[15004\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200066#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he plans to expand the electric small public service vehicles grant to driving instructors and schools in order to give learner drivers early experience of electric vehicles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>The aim of the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme is to increase the uptake of fully electric SPSVs and zero-emission capable wheelchair accessible SPSVs.<\/p><p>It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, reducing the CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions of a sector which typically has very high mileage, and also can positively influence the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles.

People who may be experiencing particular vulnerabilities must\u00a0be provided with whatever reasonable arrangements and\/or assistance they need in their\u00a0dealings with regulated entities. <\/p>  <p>  On 25 June 2021, the Central Bank issued an\u00a0industry letter\u00a0regarding its consumer protection expectations in the changing retail banking landscape. In respect of vulnerable customers, this industry letter sets out that all customers are potentially vulnerable to the risk of making uninformed decisions, or decisions that are not in their best interests, particularly during times of uncertainty and change. The Central Bank sets out the following expectation of regulated entities in respect of vulnerable customers:<\/p>  <p>  Consider specifically the impact of their decisions on vulnerable customers and provide the assistance necessary to reasonably mitigate those impacts and retain access to basic financial services.<\/p>  <p>  Have specific and effective processes and communication plans to support vulnerable customers during\u00a0a time of increased uncertainty.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  More generally my Department engages regularly with the banking sector on a wide variety of relevant issues including consumer related matters. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also currently undertaking a review of the retail banking sector.

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels.<\/p><p>MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. In complying with ETD minimum rates, total MOT rates are taken into account. To clarify the position in relation to PQs\u00a013696\/22 and 13697\/22 answered on 10th March, there was an incorrect reference to MOT in relation to kerosene. This should have read as the non-carbon component of MOT. While the non-carbon component is zero, there is a carbon component of MOT on kerosene, currently set at &euro;84.84 per 1000 litres.<\/p><p>Under the ETD, the minimum rate of taxation on kerosene used for heating purposes is set at zero. While kerosene is the predominant oil used for heating, gas oil (diesel) is also used. Where gas oil is used for heating the ETD minimum tax rate is &euro;21.00 per 1,000 litres. Kerosene used for heating purposes is marked red, and gas oil is marked green and is usually referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO) or green diesel. <\/p><p>The non-carbon component of MOT on heating kerosene is zero so the total applicable MOT comprises the carbon component (carbon tax) only. MGO attracts both components of MOT. On 1 May 2022, the basis of carbon tax applied to non-propellant fuels will increase from &euro;33.50 to &euro;41.00 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions. Current MOT rates, and those applying from 1 May 2022, are given in the table below in euros per 1,000 litres.

In this regard, I am aware that in line with the Programme for Government commitment work is ongoing in Department of Justice to comprehensively reform the regulation of gambling activities and to provide for an independent Gambling Regulator. The Gambling Regulator will be responsible for enforcing appropriate licensing and regulatory measures in respect of all gambling activities, including online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200067#WRM03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200067#WRM03100"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[14393\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200067#WRM03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider requesting that banks reduce or end returned direct debit charges given the rising cost of living and the struggle experienced by some in paying bills.","asker":"1453","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>As\u00a0Minister for Finance, I do not have a direct function in the operations of any bank.

Revenue has also confirmed that approximately 68% of queries received through MyEnquiries were responded to within 5 days in 2021, while over 90% were responded to within 20 days. (Revenue&rsquo;s Customer Service Standard across all service channels is within 20 days, or 25 days during peak periods.) Taxpayer queries where further information is needed or where there are complex issues involved can sometimes take longer than the normal 20 day\/25 day turnaround time. <\/p><p>Regarding the average waiting times for the PAYE Helpline, Revenue has confirmed that the peak period for this service occurs during the early months of the year (January to April) when taxpayers submit their income tax returns for the previous year\/s, claim any refunds or reliefs to which they are entitled, and check their tax credits for the current year. To date in 2022, the PAYE service has processed over 730,000 tax returns, answered more than 163,000 telephone calls, and dealt with over 224,000 items of correspondence received through the online services and the post.<\/p><p>To ensure optimum support to PAYE taxpayers throughout the year, Revenue continuously reviews its service channels and deploys its resources on an agile basis to meet demand. For example, analysis of PAYE taxpayer telephone activity indicates that most contacts are received during the morning, with much reduced demand in the afternoon. Operating the PAYE Helpline from 9.30am to 1.30pm each day ensures that the service is there to meet demand while also ensuring adequate resources are available to provide timely replies to queries received through the increasing online channel and through the post. The service is currently answering between 4,000 and 5,000 calls per day while also responding to between 4,500 and 6,000 correspondence items per day.<\/p><p>Revenue has acknowledged that the average waiting time on the PAYE telephone service during the current peak period is approximately ten minutes. Much of this delay is attributed to clarifying the taxation arrangements for Pandemic Unemployment Payments (PUP) and Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments, which can result in some calls taking longer than would normally be the case. It is expected that this waiting time will reduce over the coming weeks as the peak period passes.<\/p><p>Regarding public office arrangements, I am aware that Revenue has invested very significantly in IT based solutions that allow taxpayers manage their tax affairs at a time that suits them, for the most part without the need to engage directly with officials or visit the tax office. These systems are available on a 24\/7 basis, are intuitive and easy to use, and are secure to the highest standards. The online systems include the already mentioned MyEnquiries service, which allows taxpayers send queries to Revenue should they need to do so. As already outlined, most of these queries are responded to within 5 days. The year on year increase in online activity (2020 had reduced customer queries due to COVID-19) is testament to the popularity of the services with taxpayers and significantly negates the requirement to operate public offices.<\/p><p>However, Revenue accepts that there will always be a requirement for direct discussions where more complex issues exist or where a taxpayer experiences IT related difficulties. To support taxpayers and tax agents where such circumstances arise, Revenue provides a virtual appointment service, which can be booked through a dedicated telephone number (01-7383660). The appointment service started in March 2020 and has received over 250 requests to date. Appointments are usually facilitated within two days of the request.<\/p><p>Revenue has confirmed that it will expand the virtual appointments service to include face to face appointments as part of its post-pandemic blended working arrangements. It is anticipated that this service will be available in the coming weeks as the blended working arrangements are bedded in. <table>    <tr>       <th>Description <\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2018 <\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2019 <\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2020 <\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2021 <\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2022 (To Date)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Calls  <\/td>       <td>MyEnquiries  <\/td>       <td>Calls  <\/td>       <td>MyEnquiries  <\/td>       <td>Calls  <\/td>       <td>MyEnquiries  <\/td>       <td>Calls  <\/td>       <td>MyEnquiries  <\/td>       <td>Calls  <\/td>       <td>MyEnquiries <\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Personal Tax Enquiries <\/td>       <td>882,514 <\/td>       <td>691,114 <\/td>       <td>1,160,426 <\/td>       <td>1,112,414 <\/td>       <td>629,259 <\/td>       <td>948,420 <\/td>       <td>881,563 <\/td>       <td>1,545,021 <\/td>       <td>163,095 <\/td>       <td>324,803 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Business Tax   Enquiries<\/td>       <td>231,686 <\/td>       <td>49,881 <\/td>       <td>446,037 <\/td>       <td>285,157 <\/td>       <td>211,696 <\/td>       <td>256,557 <\/td>       <td>219,067 <\/td>       <td>599,536 <\/td>       <td>40,427 <\/td>       <td>95,810 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Other* <\/td>       <td>351,850 <\/td>       <td>287,995<\/td>       <td>875,087 <\/td>       <td>302,229<\/td>       <td>577,495 <\/td>       <td>155,410<\/td>       <td>939,186 <\/td>       <td>377,325<\/td>       <td>137,447 <\/td>       <td>41,231\u00a0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals  <\/td>       <td>1,466,050 <\/td>       <td>1,028,950 <\/td>       <td>2,481,550 <\/td>       <td>1,699,800 <\/td>       <td>1,418,450 <\/td>       <td>1,360,387 <\/td>       <td>2,039,816 <\/td>       <td>2,521,882 <\/td>       <td>340,969 <\/td>       <td>461,844 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Includes calls to the Collector-General&rsquo;s Office, the ROS Helpdesk, Vehicle Registration Tax, Customs, Stamping and Local Property Tax. \u00a0<\/p><p>Excludes queries received through the post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200067#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":702,"content":"<p>Question No. 252 answered with Question No. 251.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":703,"content":"<p>Question No. 253 answered with Question No. 251.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":704,"content":"<p>Question No. 254 answered with Question No. 251.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":705,"content":"<p>Question No. 255 answered with Question No. 251.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":706,"content":"<p>Question No. 256 answered with Question No. 251.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":707,"content":"<p>Question No. 257 answered with Question No. 251.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":708,"content":"<p>Question No. 258 answered with Question No. 251.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":709,"content":"<p>Question No. 259 answered with Question No. 250.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":710,"content":"<p>Question No. 260 answered with Question No. 250.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200067#WRM05900"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[14536\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200067#WRM06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason an annuity pension in the case of a person (details supplied) appears to be taxed at a higher rate; if a review will be undertaken to ensure that they are paying the correct rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the person&rsquo;s standard rate tax band was allocated in full to his other income, which meant that his annuity pension was taxed at the higher rate.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that following discussions with the person, Revenue has reallocated the appropriate portion of his standard rate tax band to his annuity pension for 2022 and has updated his Universal Social Charge (USC) status to exempt.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in those policies, nor can I direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland for further comment on this matter, so that I could provide some further information.

Where an individual disposes of a\u00a0second property, whether through a sale or a gift to a family member,\u00a0CGT is currently levied at 33% on the chargeable gain usually the difference between the price paid for the asset and the price it is\u00a0disposed\u00a0for. <\/p>  <p>  I would note that in general where the property is inherited after the death of the owner no CGT is due. If the property is gifted while the owner is still alive, while CGT and CAT may be both due, you can use the CGT paid as a credit against the CAT due. The credit cannot be greater than the amount of CAT which is due on the gift or inheritance.<\/p>  <p>  While I can understand the thinking behind the proposal to exempt property transactions from CGT in order to encourage property owners to sell or gift their property to family members,\u00a0 taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost overall housing supply. The presumption should be that non-tax measures should be considered before the use of a tax&ndash;based measure. I would wish to avoid any tax expenditures that could distort the market, particularly where it is not clear that they\u00a0would in this instance result in additional supply and could reduce the availability of rental properties.

The addition of festivals supported under the arts grant and strategic funding schemes ensures that there is a flexible and comprehensive support for festivals in Ireland. The Council recognises the distinctive role arts festivals play in sustaining a vibrant and sustainable arts profile at local level.

Across the programme of events and initiatives, it is open to local authorities to use some of this funding for creative programming in support of diversity and equality. Creative events have included the Virtual LGBT+ Awareness &amp;amp; Inclusion Youth Festival in Galway, as part of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2021.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.\u00a0The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management manages fire service issues in my Department. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Fire services in Ireland are provided by the local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide deliver local authority fire services. 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of\u00a0years, even\u00a0when\u00a0staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in\u00a0other areas of the local authority sector.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms\/ standards established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, 'Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach, which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires that occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;Retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review will have a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues that are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options that will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future. The Project Team will work with and report to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Fire Service Operations Committee in the performance of its functions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development.

Building control authorities have strong powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts. Authorised officers of each local building control authority have delegated powers to: -<\/p>  <p>  - scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress;<\/p>  <p>  - serve enforcement notices on owners and builders for non-compliance;<\/p>  <p>  - institute proceedings for breaches of any requirements outlined in the Acts, or any<\/p>  <p>  - regulations made thereunder; and<\/p>  <p>  - seek High Court orders to mitigate danger to the public where serious non-compliance poses risks to public safety.<\/p>  <p>  Failure by an owner or a builder, at the request of a building control authority, to demonstrate compliance with the Building Regulations or the Building Control Regulations, or to rectify any such non-compliance, may be an offence under the Building Control Acts.\u00a0 If successfully prosecuted in court, such offences may lead to a fine and\/or a term of imprisonment. \u00a0The use of these powers is, however, subject to a statute of limitations of five years from the date of completion of the buildings concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Other significant pieces of redress and producers&rsquo; liability legislation which may apply to construction products are the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980; and the Liability for Defective Products Act 1991. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of addressing building defects. Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates this commitment.\u00a0 In this regard, in 2021 I established\u00a0a Working Group to examine fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.\u00a0 The\u00a0Working Group will report to me\u00a0later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations.\u00a0Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.<\/p>  <p>  Finally,\u00a0the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2021 is currently being debated in the Oireachtas.

The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. These requirements are set out in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M).\u00a0The Building Regulations are set out in functional terms. They are performance based and technology\/material neutral. They do not set limitations on the materials. Primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.<\/p>  <p>  The associated Technical Guidance Documents (TGD A - M respectively) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the Building Regulations in practical terms for simple non-complex buildings.

The first, fundamental, reason is that open lines of communication facilitate diplomacy - which is more important than ever in a conflict situation. They allow us to press Russia on the need for a ceasefire, and to allow for effective humanitarian intervention. Communication with the Ambassador also allows us to directly convey our strong disagreement with the Russian Government as it continues to fall short of its obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly,\u00a0diplomatic engagement helps us to better protect Irish interests, and to protect our citizens - in Russia\u00a0and the five central Asian republics for which Ireland is represented by our Embassy in Moscow.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, we need to consider our actions within the context of the wider EU response. Like all of our other responses during this crisis, we are\u00a0coordinating closely with EU Member States and like minded partners.\u00a0When I attended the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 February, I discussed the issue of Russian diplomatic presence with my EU counterparts.

Where a school employs a staff member to\u00a0support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for\u00a0terms of employment rests with the school. The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. <\/p>  <p>On the 24th February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome. The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,\u00a0 moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to an incremental salary scale, secretaries may also choose to receive additional increments\u00a0if they decide that they no longer wish to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The package of proposals on offer to school secretaries\u00a0also include standardised terms and conditions in relation to\u00a0\u00a0annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.<\/p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present. As set out in the framework agreement of 14 September 2021, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Should the proposal be agreed and an implementation plan put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.<\/p>  <p>  This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries and caretakers in our schools. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for staff who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and I would encourage school secretaries to vote in favour of it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200075#WRU05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":1272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200075#WRU06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1273,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[13871\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200075#WRU06100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress that has been made to date in relation to a section 29 appeal by a person (details supplied); when a decision will issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1274,"content":"<p>The final determination of\u00a0the Section 29 Appeals Committee was issued to\u00a0the parties to this appeal on the 8th March 2022.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The appeals process as provided for under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has now concluded <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200075#WRU06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1275,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200075#WRU06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1276,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[13880\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200075#WRU06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the primary and post-primary schools in an area (details supplied); and the number of pupils, teachers, SNAs and annual State funding by school in tabular form.","asker":"1568","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1277,"content":"<p>As requested, please find attached Roll Numbers of the primary and post-primary schools in an area (D01;03;07;09); and the total number of pupils, teachers, SNAs and annual State funding for these schools for 2020\/21 in a tabular form.

Actions to advance Traveller education outcomes form part of this Strategy. My Department participated in the development of the NTRIS, which contains over 30 education-related\u00a0actions, from early years to further and higher education, and officials will be working with the Department of Further and Higher Education Research Innovation and Science, and engaging with and supporting the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in its review of the Strategy and development of the next iteration of the Strategy as committed to in the Programme for Government. Officials from my Department attend the NTRIS Plenary Steering Group meetings in addition to the NTRIS Education subgroup, which meet regularly throughout the year.<\/p><p>DEIS - Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools<\/p><p>DEIS is the main policy instrument of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage at school level. Schools in the DEIS programme avail of a range of targeted supports aimed at tackling educational disadvantage, including additional classroom teaching posts, home school community liaison coordinator posts, DEIS grant funding and access to the School Completion Programme. The DEIS Plan includes specific actions in relation to Traveller and Roma education to promote improvements in school attendance and completion. <\/p><p>Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme, providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 and rising to an additional &euro;32 million in 2023.

On 9 March this year, I announced a major expansion of the programme, with the inclusion of an additional 310 schools and the reclassification of an additional 37 existing DEIS schools, making these eligible for increased supports.<\/p><p>The refined DEIS identification model captures a greater breadth of disadvantage than the earlier model. Importantly, it takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners, as well as of students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.

It acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures. The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.<\/p><p>Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of their own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.<\/p><p>Anti-Bullying Measures<\/p><p>The 2013 Action Plan on Bullying sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools.

These include the following:<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0- As part of Junior Cycle, students normally complete two classroom-based assessments (CBAs) in each subject. In this current school year, however, each student must complete a minimum of only one CBA in each subject.<\/p>  <p>  - The school has autonomy in deciding which CBAs will be completed by students with two exceptions. In the case of the languages and practical subjects the CBA that students complete is specified because it is linked to the externally assessed practical examination.<\/p>  <p>  - As CBAs are school-based assessments, schools have been advised that there are flexibilities in the windows for completion of the CBAs in light of particular circumstances schools may encounter due to COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  - The Assessment Task, which is usually assessed and marked by the SEC, will not be assessed in 2022 in the relevant subjects. Instead the written examination will account for 100% of the marks;<\/p>  <p>  - Adjustments have been made to the requirements for practicals and coursework in subjects including for example, Music, Home Economic, Art and the Technologies.<\/p>  <p>  - No changes have been made to the written examination papers because of the design of the new specifications for Junior Cycle. The Junior Cycle examination papers are completed in a booklet format with students required to answer all questions. The papers are designed to assess the subject specifications in an integrated way, reflecting the way in which teachers&rsquo; expertise is used to plan for delivering the subjects using integrated strands and elements. Any adjustments made to these papers at this stage would make them fundamentally different from expectations and would be more likely to disadvantage than to benefit students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200077#WRW03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Educational Disadvantage","counter":1392,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200077#WRW03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1393,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[14436\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200077#WRW03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that a school (details supplied) has not been included in the new list on the DEIS schools programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1394,"content":"<p>I announced on 9 March, 2022 the expansion of the DEIS programme benefitting 347 schools.

It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. <\/p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040.

In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. <\/p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can also be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, in east Cork, there are a number of significant school building projects providing additional capacity at post primary level:<\/p>  <p>  - Carrigtwohill Community\u00a0College (76333G) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment\u00a0 of 535 for the 2021\/2022 school year.

in Dublin, Cork and Limerick are assisting Ukrainians in obtaining PPS numbers, availing of social welfare income supports, and receiving referrals to other State services.\u00a0 We have also extended the opening hours of some of our Intreo Centres to provide access to PPS Numbers and income supports to people fleeing from Ukraine.\u00a0 To Sunday 20th March more than 7,300 PPS numbers have been issued and income support approved for over 5,000 people include adult dependents and children.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The allocation of PPSNs is the Department&rsquo;s immediate focus so those affected by the invasion can avail of public services and access vital social welfare income supports.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that Ukrainains coming to Ireland are provided with assistance and advice to find suitable employment.<\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0 will provide these employment supports\u00a0 through its public employment service in Intreo Offices and through jobsireland.ie.\u00a0 This will include jobsearch advice, referral to jobs or education and training courses, including language supports,\u00a0as appropriate.\u00a0 As part of this employment support process my Department will capture all information relevant to support jobsearch and training, working with relevant partner agencies such as SOLAS, Education and Training Boards and the Department of Further and Higher Education Research, Innovation and Science.<\/p>  <p>  A dedicated space is being developed on jobsireland.ie to provide information to the newly arrived Ukrainians.\u00a0 A \"Frequently Asked Questions\" is being developed which will be published on www.jobireland.ie\u00a0and be available for those who attend Intreo Offices.\u00a0\u00a0It will be available in the English, Ukrainian and Russian languages; content will be added as new information becomes available.\u00a0 This will be disseminated and promoted widely including through social media, at our Ukraine Support Hubs and at accommodation centres.<\/p>  <p>  It should be remembered that many of those newly arrived in the country are traumatised and, while some have a good level of English, many others have little or no English.\u00a0 Some may be more immediately work ready that others - some will require retraining and reskilling or time to organise childcare or school arrangements for children.\u00a0 Employment supports provided to Ukrainians will\u00a0match individual's qualification and skills, including language skills, with suitable employment opportunities.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that some employers have signalled interest in employing Ukrainians which I very much welcome. \u00a0Employers who wish to support Ukrainians by providing work opportunities should register on www.jobsireland.ie;

In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover, compounded more recently by high numbers of COVID-19 cases. Recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions, with for example the average pay for non-managerial staff being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The current number of qualified early years educators who are available to be recruited is not known. The figure depends on the number of individuals who have achieved a qualification at Level 5 or higher (on the National Framework of Qualifications) in Early Childhood Care and Education over many years, or a qualification recognised as equivalent, their current employment status (whether inside or outside the ELC\/SAC sector), as well as the current employment status of qualified staff who have previously left the sector but could return. In addition, some ELC\/SAC services recruit qualified staff from outside Ireland. It should also be noted that there is no qualification requirement to work in SAC, and so the potential pool of people who could work in SAC is much larger.<\/p>  <p>  Data on yearly enrolments and graduation in further and higher education institutions is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. However, published data from QQI indicates that 1,728 students were awarded a level 5 qualification in Early Childhood Care and Education in 2021, while 1,517 students graduated with a level 6 award. In addition, many of those completing relevant degrees (at levels 7 and 8) are also qualifying to work in the sector for the first time.  <\/p>  <p>  Statistics on the turnover rate of staff in the ELC \/ SAC sector are gathered through the Annual Early Years Sector Profile. The most recent published report, for 2019\/2020, indicates the annual staff turnover rate in 2020 was 18%, which was down five percentage points on the previous year&rsquo;s figure of 23%. Data on staff turnover in the sector in 2021 will be available with the publication of the 2020\/21 Annual Early Years Sector Profile, which I expect to publish in the coming weeks. It should be noted that data on staff turnover includes both those who leave the sector and those who move from one service to another but remain working in the sector - in 2019\/20, of those leaving a service, 22% were reported to have gone to another service, and the destination of 13% was unknown.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.<\/p>  <p>  I began a process in December 2020, which examined the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee, which began meeting in December 2021. In Budget 2022, I announced a new Core Funding stream which, among other objectives, will support service providers to meet new higher rates of pay that may be negotiated through the Joint Labour Committee. <\/p>  <p>  Also, in December 2021, I launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028, which aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare, and includes actions to support staff recruitment and retention and to raise the profile of careers in the sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200083#WRCC04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1824,"qnumday":656,"qnumall":"[13861\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200083#WRCC04400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the support and assistance that has been provided to prevent the closure of a cr&egrave;che (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1825,"content":"<p>My Department funds a national network of County Childcare Committees (CCC) who provide support and advice to early learning and childcare (ELC) providers including support on operating the various funding schemes provided by the Department and assistance for parents on accessing funding schemes and place.

Across all of Government, a wide range of specific and targeted policy approaches, designed in consultation with Traveller and Roma community representatives, are in place to seek those improved outcomes and encourage much greater inclusion across all of Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations contained in the Report of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community will  inform the next iteration of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.  I am leading on this strategy and the support of all Government Departments will be crucial in ensuring the successor strategy will have a more outcomes focused approach. <\/p>  <p>  I engaged with the Joint Oireachtas Committee before publication of their report in November 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Review of NTRIS and development of successor strategy<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the recommendations pertaining to my Department, you will be aware that the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) provides a framework for action on Traveller and Roma issues.  It represents a whole of Government approach and brings Government Departments and Agencies together with representatives of Traveller and Roma communities to focus on key issues in a structured I chair the NTRIS Steering Committee.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to a review of the Strategy and I will work with stakeholders to reviewing what has been achieved, and to developing new approaches, as necessary, with a particular focus on implementation and measurement. Proposals for an evaluation of the processes for implementation of three equality strategies - the Migrant Integration Strategy, the National Strategy for Women and Girls and NTRIS, which all concluded last year, have been sought. It is expected that the contract will be signed very shortly with work commencing in March and concluding in quarter three this year.<\/p>  <p>  The reason for proceeding with an evaluation process that spans a number of equality strategies is to place the focus on implementation and to identify potential good practice in some areas that can be transferred to others.  The objectives of our equality strategies remain largely relevant and the key challenge is to ensure better delivery.  The issue of intersectionality also needs to be addressed in a more coherent manner.  <\/p>  <p>  The current NTRIS Steering Committee is remaining in operation during the Review process and our next meeting is scheduled for the end of March.  Work will continue on implementing NTRIS&rsquo;s actions, many of which remain highly relevant.   <\/p>  <p>  The Strategy Committee&rsquo;s role will also be pivotal in developing the consultation process and the content for the successor strategy. The advice provided by Traveller and Roma organisations will directly shape the scope and focus of the next strategy. <\/p>  <p>  Early learning and Care Services<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the recommendations that relate to the early years sector, my Department will consider approaches to informing and supporting enhanced participation of Traveller and Roma children in Early Learning and Care services.   <\/p>  <p>  First 5 commits to the introduction of a DEIS-type model for Early Learning and Care settings to create further opportunities to narrow the gap for disadvantaged children including those from Traveller and Roma communities and we will be working on the design and development of this model.<\/p>  <p>  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is available for all children including Traveller and Roma children with additional needs.  The AIM model seeks to create a more inclusive environment in pre-schools, so all children, regardless of ability, can benefit from quality early learning and care. The model achieves this by providing universal supports to pre-school settings, and targeted supports, which focus on the needs of the individual child, without requiring a diagnosis of disability.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training.  This training aims to foster awareness regarding equality, diversity and inclusion. It seeks to encourage and support those working in the Early Learning &amp;amp; Care (ELC) sector to actively advocate for the inclusion of all children and their families within the ELC setting. <\/p>  <p>  Employment<\/p>  <p>  Employment is an ongoing challenge in the Traveller and Roma community.  In the development of the successor strategy to NTRIS, my Department will work with the NTRIS employment subgroup, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in developing an action plan for Traveller employment.<\/p>  <p>  Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as you will be aware, the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty is a legal obligation on all public bodies to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. Furthermore, a public body is required to report annually on developments and achievements in regard to the equality and human rights issues and actions, in a manner accessible to the public, in its annual report. The requirement to integrate the Duty in strategic plans and annual reports means that it is an ongoing obligation that must be monitored, reviewed, and developed in each strategic planning cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200083#WRCC06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":1841,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200083#WRCC06100"},{"type":"question","counter":1842,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[14026\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200083#WRCC06200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of Syrian and Afghan citizens who have been granted leave to remain in Ireland under the recently established programme refugee scheme and family reunification scheme.","asker":"1468","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1843,"content":"<p>As you may be aware, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established in 2015.

Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance. <\/p><p>Core Funding is designed to operate alongside the existing funding schemes, including the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). Therefore, the NCS will continue to provide subsidies for children in attendance and ECCE will continue to provide capitation.<\/p><p>Services will be required to offer the NCS and\/or the ECCE programme to all eligible children\/parents, in line with their operations, and will be invited to report on the quality development measures they are pursuing.<\/p><p>A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding to their service is available at earlyyearshive.ncs.gov.ie\/ReadyReckoner\/. <\/p><p>Participation in Core Funding for ELC and SAC providers will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates in return for the increased State funding. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the affordability benefits of the NCS and ECCE, including the full effects of the NCS reforms announced in Budget 2022 .<\/p><p>Budget 2022 also announced a once-off Transition Fund which will be available to ELC and SAC services from May to August inclusive, during the period between the ending of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in April and the introduction of a new Core Funding stream in September. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is that fees to parents do not increase above September 2021 levels. <\/p><p>The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group, as approved by Government. Fee management will start with a requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access the new Core Funding scheme and Transition Fund, as outlined above. Further information on proposed fee management mechanisms in the longer term is available in the Group's report, available at: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie <\/p><p>Providers who have increased their fees above September 2021 levels will be required to revert to September 2021 levels before May 2022 to be eligible for the Transition Fund in May 2022. Similarly, to be eligible for the new Core Funding stream, providers who have increased their fees above September 2021 levels will be required to revert to September 2021 levels before September 2022. <\/p><p>These measures were announced as part of the Budget in October 2021, meaning that services did not have the opportunity to raise their fees in advance of the reference period for the fee freeze after the announcement.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 also confirmed that ELC and SAC employers will continue to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the EWSS until April 2022, in part to avoid the additional costs arising from public health measures being passed on to parents.  <\/p><p>The EWSS has been available to employers in the sector since August 2020.  Enhanced EWSS rates (from October 2020-January 2022) amount to approximately &euro;34 million per month for the sector, covering on average 80% of payroll costs and 50% of total operating costs for providers.  Standard EWSS (from August 2020-October 2020 and for February 2022) amount to approximately &euro;22 million per month for the sector, covering on average 50% of payroll costs and 38% of total operating costs for providers. A new EWSS flat rate of &euro;100 that will apply from March-April 2022 will amount to approximately &euro;11 million per month for the sector, covering on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs. <\/p><p>Given the level of investment being made available to the sector through EWSS, it is difficult to see any justification for an increase in fees at this time.<\/p><p>\u200e\u200eSustainability Funding also continues to be available to providers where there are sustainability difficulties and I have requested that providers would exhaust this route before considering increases in fees for parents. I encourage providers to contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee if they require any further information or support. <\/p><p>Core Funding is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200084#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":1879,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200084#WRDD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1880,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[14462\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200084#WRDD02200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he plans to review the rate of fostering allowance paid to foster carers as recommended by the working group on foster care in 2001 that recommended that the foster care allowance should increase in line with social welfare payments on an annual basis given that this did happen up until 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1881,"content":"<p>The Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, stipulates that the allowance payable to foster carers and relatives shall not be less than an amount specified by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance was last increased on January 1st 2009. Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.  <\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.<\/p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.  <\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances.

The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase. In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Capital funding has been reduced in 2022 to &euro;0.5m as my Department focusses on the preparation of distribution of NDP funding from 2023 onwards. This will include setting eligibility criteria, designing and developing the application process, and establishing approval criteria. This 2022 allocation is for Childminding and Parent and Toddler Groups, who maintain 2021 allocations. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has secured some &euro;750k in capital funding which will be made available to provide financial assistance to providers to comply with fire safety regulations in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Further information on the Department&rsquo;s NDP allocation and the application process will be communicated to the sector in the near future. The Department advises the service to contact their local CCCs, who will provide information on future capital supports when it becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200084#WRDD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Qualifications Recognition","counter":1906,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200084#WRDD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1907,"qnumday":687,"qnumall":"[14587\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200084#WRDD04900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a manager with a level 6+ qualification and 18 years&rsquo; experience will not meet the uplift requirements in relation to the Core Funding Plan for Childcare; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that for them to get a level 7 qualification they need to return to college for approximately six years to do nine modules at a cost of approx. &euro;4,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1908,"content":"<p>First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care.

This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications.

For example, with an ECCE occupancy of 9 children per staff member, Core Funding and ECCE together will be equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding\u00a0replaces the ECCE Higher Capitation payment\u00a0which\u00a0is pays a higher capitation\u00a0rate of &euro;80.25\u00a0for all children attending\u00a0ECCE classes with a graduate ECCE room lead.\u00a0 Core Funding includes a new\u00a0a graduate premium which will be to be paid to services with graduate room leads\u00a0for all\u00a0\u00a0early learning and\u00a0care age groups. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A small number of services, estimated to be approximately 50 in total or 1% of all providers,\u00a0would receive less\u00a0under Core Funding than they\u00a0 received in Higher Capitation payments. For this small number of providers, I have issued a funding guarantee whereby, under Core Funding providers will receive the same level of funding as they received from ECCE Higher Capitation, assuming the numbers of children, graduate staff and type of service offered remains the same in the 2022\/23 programme year as in 2021\/22.\u00a0 Services for whom the Funding Guarantee will apply are higher capitation ECCE services with large groups and high occupancy that are currently in receipt of the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regard to staffing difficulties in the ELC sector, I acknowledge that early learning and care and school-age childcare services can experience staffing and recruitment difficulties and I have committed to supporting service providers in their efforts in recruiting qualified staff.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.<\/p>  <p>  On 7 December 2021, I launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028, which aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. There is no differentiation in Nurturing Skills for the different types of service providers.\u00a0 The plan aims to make improvements for staff in all services, full time or sessional.\u00a0\u00a0In additional, a Joint Labour Committee is currently meeting to\u00a0set pay scales for the sector which, if agreed, will be set out in an Employment Regulation Order.\u00a0 Together these initiatives will improve staff retention in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department\u00a0has recently commenced a review of the ECCE programme to assess\u00a0the value of the programme and to identify potential improvements.\u00a0\u00a0ECCE providers, parents, children and stakeholders will\u00a0be invited to contribute to the review later this year.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200085#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":1940,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200085#WREE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1941,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[14988\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200085#WREE01500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"when the enhanced medical card will be issued regarding the redress scheme proposed for mother and baby home survivors; the treatments and services it will cover; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1942,"qnumday":699,"qnumall":"[14989\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200085#WREE01600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if a compensation payment will impact on pensions or affect means testing in circumstances in which survivors qualify for the fuel allowance and other payments regarding the redress scheme proposed for mother and baby home survivors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1943,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 698 and 699 together.<\/p><p>I am acutely aware of the sense of urgency surrounding the establishment of\u00a0the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme.

I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Deputy and other members of the Joint Committee for their work in highlighting issues affecting members of the Traveller community and for the publication of this comprehensive report. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Joint Committee on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community has now been dissolved and has been replaced with ad hoc Oireachtas group with the Ceann Comhairle as Cathaoirleach. In addition to the Ceann Comhairle, the ad hoc group is comprised of the Cathaoirligh of the Oireachtas committees whose remit mirrors the responsibilities of the Departments to whom the recommendations were submitted as well as members of the former Joint Committee. <\/p>  <p>  The ad hoc Oireachtas group is seeking to make progress in 2022 on the 84 recommendations in the Final Report, including the 23 education recommendations. In this regard, I can confirm that my officials have been in correspondence with ad hoc Oireachtas group recently to update it on the progress made in the tertiary education sector.<\/p>  <p>  The key recommendations for the tertiary education sector include, inter alia, recommendations for: targeted financial supports; affirmative policy actions to encourage more Travellers into the teaching profession; the creation of culturally appropriate apprenticeship and internship schemes; and the development of a &ldquo;Traveller Graduate Network&rdquo;. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department is proactively progressing initiatives in all of these areas. These include: <\/p>  <p>  - The Student Assistance Fund is available to assist students who are unable to meet costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education, including essential travel and childcare costs. Additional financial supports were secured under the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2021 and again in 2022 to address Covid related issues affecting Traveller progression to and retention within higher education. <\/p>  <p>  - The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) includes a targeted initiative aimed at increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in Initial Teacher Education. One of the projects funded under this initiative is the TOBAR project in the Marino Institute of Education\/TCD Centre. The TOBAR project focuses specifically on working with members of the Irish Traveller community to access initial teacher education (ITE) on primary, post-primary and further education programmes. A separate initiative under the PATH programme is the Travellers in Education project which is being led by a consortium of higher education institutes in the southern region. One of the key outcomes from Phase 1 is in respect of a Traveller Graduate Network which is currently engaged with 26 graduates.<\/p>  <p>  - The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was published last April.

Given these interconnections, it is my intention\u00a0to bring the Student grant review to Cabinet alongside the report on funding and reform of higher education. <\/p>  <p>  Implementing the Report recommendations is a key priority for my Department. Accordingly,\u00a0I have already initiated\u00a0improvements to the Student Grant Scheme for the academic year 2022\/23 to\u00a0allow early progress in addressing key themes emerging from the Review of SUSI, and to\u00a0further\u00a0alleviate\u00a0the\u00a0pressures arising from the recent\u00a0trends in the cost of living for students and their families. These changes have been targeted at alleviating\u00a0cost of living pressures for students and their families, supporting students who have to travel longer distances to their institution, recognising the need to reflect changes in income levels and expanding supports for postgraduates.<\/p>  <p>  The changes I made in Budget 2022, will mean that from the next academic year:-<\/p>  <p>  - All student grant\u00a0maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, will increase\u00a0 by &euro;200 per year. <\/p>  <p>  - The income thresholds to\u00a0 qualify for the standard rates of student grant will increase by &euro;1,000. <\/p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has\u00a0 been reduced from 45km to 30km.\u00a0This means from the commencement of the 2022\/23 academic year, students who reside 30km or more from the college attended will now qualify for the higher, non-adjacent rate of grant (of up to &euro;6,115 for the non-adjacent special rate of grant for the most disadvantaged students).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These changes will benefit thousands of students and will build\u00a0on the improvements that have already been made\u00a0through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I understand the Department of Transport have\u00a0introduced a new \"Youth Travel Card\" as part of Budget 2022, which will offer\u00a050% discount on fares across the public transport network for those aged 19 to 23.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. In 2020 and 2021, as part of the package of COVID supports, the Department allocated &euro;10m to an Access Funding package which resulted in the doubling of the Student Assistance Fund (&euro;8.1m) and additional funding of &euro;1.9m for other vulnerable students in line with the National Access Plan and through existing structures within HEIs.\u00a0 Also in 2021, an additional &euro;1.3m was allocated to the SAF to meet the additional demands identified by the Higher Education Institutions arising from COVID19. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The ILEP is managed by the Department of Justice in conjunction with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A condition of an ILEP listing is a requirement for education providers to operate an 'escrow' type account with a bank or financial institution regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.

Underpinned by strong\u00a0partnership with key stakeholders, it is\u00a0focused on\u00a0responding flexibly to\u00a0priority skill needs and to technology-driven changes in the world of work so that Ireland has a skilled and\u00a0productive workforce.<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Skills Strategy, the skills ecosystem encompasses the National Skills Council and Regional Skills Fora and labour market information entities including the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.\u00a0This response facilitates engagement, dialogue, and collaboration between relevant Government Departments and agencies, the education and training system, enterprise agencies, and private sector representatives, and informs and drives responsive and flexible forecasting, planning, and provision\u00a0across all sectors of the economy.\u00a0It helps to identify skills provision shortfalls to be addressed by the education and training system and concerns\u00a0relating\u00a0to labour shortages in particular sectors that relate to\u00a0other factors. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the National Economic Recovery Plan, and in partnership with the OECD, I launched a Skills Strategy Project which will play an important role in ensuring that Ireland's skills system is effective in meeting skills and human capital needs.\u00a0It will be\u00a0central to our economic and social sustainability against the backdrop of major trends impacting on the workforce and society including digitisation and climate transition. <\/p>  <p>  Apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme which develops the skills of an apprentice in order to meet industry and labour market needs. Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers in the sector. The development of new apprenticeships is also employer-led and it is open to employers to work with education and training providers to develop new apprenticeships if there is sufficient demand from the sector.\u00a0 Further details can be found on www.apprenticeship.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rsquo; aims to ensure that the apprenticeship system will contribute to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s skills and human capital requirements by delivering on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make them more accessible to employers and learners. Expanding apprenticeship across all sectors of the economy has widened its impact in areas of skills shortage such as Engineering, Technology Skills, Logistics and FinTech. Under the Plan there will be an increase in online visibility of apprenticeship engagement and apprenticeship development processes for employers\/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeship development.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 64 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 39 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic: Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding, Supply Chain Associate. Two new programmes have launched in recent weeks: Wind Turbine Maintenance and Bar Manager with another, Transport Operations and Commercial Driving also expected to launch shortly.<\/p>  <p>  There are 12 additional programmes being developed across agriculture, construction, engineering, equine, finance, horticulture, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics. A number of other potential apprenticeships are at an exploratory stage, in sectors such as health, beauty, environmental, engineering, ICT and finance.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;34 million was provided in Budget 2022 to expand apprenticeship, including the development of new programmes noted above, the establishment of the National Apprenticeship Office which will operationalise the new system, and funding to introduce a new employer grant. This grant of &euro;2,000 per eligible apprentice is designed to encourage more employers to engage with a wider range of apprenticeships and to help encourage the development of new programmes. It also means that, for the first time, all employers will receive a level of support towards the cost of apprentice training.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual registrations since the 2006\u00a0figure of 8,306, showing the high degree of interest in this career option amongst both employers and potential apprentices. At the end of 2021, the overall apprentice population was 24,212.<\/p>  <p>  The increase in registrations, despite the pandemic, provides us with a solid pipeline of new talent coming through the apprenticeship system and highlights the huge interest in this area of training. The measures I have outlined above, combined with other deliverables in the Action Plan, mean that we are supporting further progress towards achieving the vision articulated in the Plan and can respond to identified skills shortages. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200086#WRFF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":2028,"qnumday":728,"qnumall":"[14812\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200086#WRFF02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will respond to matters raised in correspondence (details supplied) regarding greenkeeping in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2029,"content":"<p>Apprenticeships are available in many\u00a0sectors such as manufacturing, hospitality, construction, and retail.\u00a0\u00a0The continued expansion of the apprenticeship system into new sectors of the economy such as agriculture and horticulture, together with the opportunity of online and blended learning, will bring real opportunities for learners and employers throughout the country.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This is a key priority under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which aims to increase annual registrations to 10,000 across an increasing range of programmes, in line with skills demands within the economy. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, to widen the potential scope of new apprenticeship programmes are included under the General Scheme of Higher Education Authority Bill 2022.\u00a0This will facilitate the development of programmes such as greenkeeping.\u00a0The Bill was published in January of this year and is currently at committee stage. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that regarding the area of sports turf management that there is currently an apprenticeship in development in the area of Sports Turf Management.

From the outset of the pandemic, my Department and I have worked to provide assistance and assurance to people who use our immigration services. Since the pandemic was declared in March 2020, I have provided nine temporary extension of immigration and international protection permissions to 31 May 2022.<\/p><p>My Department has responsibility for immigration-related matters, including the entry and residence conditions of non-EEA students, who are granted a Stamp 2 immigration permission, and continually consults and engages with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, among other key sectorial stakeholders, in this area.<\/p><p>A student's primary purpose for being in the State is to study. However,\u00a0since April 2001, non-EEA students with an\u00a0immigration Stamp 2 permission, and who are\u00a0enrolled on courses with education providers listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) including English language courses, have been afforded the opportunity to work.<\/p><p>This allows\u00a0them to take up casual employment to supplement their income while studying in Ireland. During term time, non-EEA students can work up to 20 hours per week and during normal college holiday periods they can work on a full time basis up to 40 hours per week.<\/p><p>All applicants for permission to study in Ireland must show that they have sufficient funds to support their stay in Ireland without recourse to public funds, or the reliance on casual employment.<\/p><p>The Stamp 2 permission will typical expire shortly after the conclusion of the course. The person will then need to apply for an employment permit, leave the state or seek a change of permission to a Stamp 1G , if they met the criteria.<\/p><p>A Stamp 1G indicates that a person has permission to look for employment in the State under the Third Level Graduate Programme. When an applicant has completed their studies in Ireland and gained an award at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or above, that person may qualify for a Stamp 1G for 12 months. Where an individual receives an award at Level 9 NFQ, they may qualify for a Stamp 1G for up to 24 months subject to the overall limit of 8 years on student conditions that applies. Graduates at level 9 NFQ or above who qualify for a Stamp 1G permission will be granted the permission for 12 months initially, further details are available on my Department's website at\u00a0.<\/p><p>Where an individual has obtained employment and prior to the expiry of their Stamp 1G permission, it is open to the employer to submit an application for an employment permit subject to meeting the criteria. Further details available are available at: www.enterprise.gov.ie. A person must hold a critical skills employment permit for 2 years or a general employment permit for 5 years before eligibility for a Stamp 4 immigration permission arises.<\/p><p>Additionally, it is open to any student that is in the State in an undocumented situation to make an application to the Regularisation of Long Term Undocumented Migrants scheme, if they meet the published qualifying criteria. This is a once in a generation scheme and I encourage all those who are eligible to make an application prior to the closing of the scheme on 31 July 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200087#WRGG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":2082,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200087#WRGG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2083,"qnumday":746,"qnumall":"[14088\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200087#WRGG00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total number of persons that have been granted a certificate of naturalisation pursuant to section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 in the past five years and in the past 12 months.","asker":"1453","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":2084,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[14089\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200087#WRGG01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons that have been granted citizenship pursuant to section 16 by reason of Irish descent in the past five years and in the past 12 months.","asker":"1453","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":2085,"qnumday":748,"qnumall":"[14090\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200087#WRGG01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons that have been granted citizenship pursuant to section 16 by reason of Irish association in the past five years and in the past 12 months.","asker":"1453","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":2086,"qnumday":749,"qnumall":"[14091\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200087#WRGG01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons that have been granted citizenship pursuant to section 16 by reason of Irish association based on Irish ascent in the past five years and in the past 12 months.","asker":"1453","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2087,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 746, 747, 748 and 749 together.<\/p><p>Statistics are not compiled or maintained in the manner requested by the Deputy, i.e. whether an application was granted based on Irish Association by Descent or Ascent other than in the case of applications in respect of a minor of Irish descent or Irish associations or a refugee. <\/p><p>The retrieval of the data requested would require a case by case examination of all applications received during the timeframe specified, approximately 60,000 applications.

The Covid-19 Contingency Plan is an internal operational document for the management of Covid-19 outbreaks in prisons and has not been published for security and operational reasons.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic wide ranging infection control measures and restrictions were introduced to prevent the spread of Covid-19 within the prison estate including the suspension of physical visits, the restriction of movements within prisons and the introduction of a restricted regime for prisoners in the infected area while mass testing was underway.<\/p>  <p>  A substantial amount of work has been carried out by the Prison Service to address the evolving challenges, both in the broad range of protective measures designed to keep prisoners and staff safe, as well as initiatives to mitigate against the inevitable impact of Covid-related restrictions and changes in regime on those in custody, however necessary they may be. All while continuing to provide a range of rehabilitative support services for prisoners in custody.<\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service has been very successful in its management of Covid-19 since the pandemic commenced in March 2020. However, it is a fact that managing the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic has proved to be significant, particularly over such a protracted period of time.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Prison Service has at all times been very mindful of the impact the necessary measures introduced to restrict the spread of Covid-19 have on the routine of the prisoner population and has consistently kept all such measures under review. <\/p>  <p>  In early 2021, the Prison Service aligned the unwinding of restrictions to the roll out of the Covid-19 vaccination programme in prisons. As a result of the successful roll out of the vaccination programme to all prisons, the Service was in a position to unwind a significant amount of restrictive measures in all locations with the exception of Cloverhill Prison which did not have a critical mass of prisoners vaccinated at the time.<\/p>  <p>  In mid 2021, following the latest advice from Government, the Prison Service commenced a further unwinding of measures in line with similar actions taken in the community.<\/p>  <p>  This included:<\/p>  <p>  - the recommencement of physical visits in all locations,<\/p>  <p>  - the removal on the restriction preventing the mixing of prisoners from different areas within the prison,<\/p>  <p>  - the return of constructive activities to full capacity,<\/p>  <p>  - the recommencement of prisoner temporary release programmes, and<\/p>  <p>  - the resumption of religious services.<\/p>  <p>  The resumption of these services was contingent on the continuation of a number of infection control measures to ensure the health and safety of both staff\/service providers and prisoners. <\/p>  <p>  In early 2022, the Irish Prison Service undertook another significant review of infection control measures resulting in further restrictions being lifted. This included an increase in the number of visitors permitted to visit prisoners, the resumption of non-essential prison visits including the facilitation of in-reach services on a priority basis and the removal of capacity restrictions and the compulsory wearing of facial coverings.<\/p>  <p>  As a result the majority of restrictive measures have been lifted. However, the Prison Service, recognising the threat that Covid-19 continues to pose to the vulnerable prison population, has continued a number of infection control measures such as the quarantining of new committals and the isolation of suspected cases.

The HSE have identified the more realistic recruitment target of 5,500 WTE alongside a more challenging &lsquo;stretch&rsquo; target of 10,000 WTE set out in the 2022 National Service Plan. The upper affordable limit is ambitious and challenging to achieve, given the risks affecting labour market supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200089#WRJJ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200089#WRJJ04500"},{"type":"question","counter":2207,"qnumday":790,"qnumall":"[15509\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200089#WRJJ04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will instruct the HSE to continue to fund long-Covid occupational therapy services in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital which are currently set to cease in April.","asker":"1570","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2208,"qnumday":791,"qnumall":"[15520\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200089#WRJJ04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of funding for a senior occupational therapist in the long Covid clinic at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital; if there will be a reduction in such posts in 2022 on 2021 levels at this site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2209,"qnumday":1039,"qnumall":"[14807\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200089#WRJJ04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that the occupational therapy in the long-Covid clinic at St. James's Hospital is being discontinued in April 2022 (details supplied); if he will provide funding to keep occupational therapy in the clinic; if will he further invest in a nationwide network of multidisciplinary long-Covid clinics to ensure that Ireland has the capacity and expertise to deal with this growing challenge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2210,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 790, 791 and 1039 together.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to the Deputy directly<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200089#WRJJ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2211,"content":"<p>Question No. 791 answered with Question No. 790.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":2212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200089#WRJJ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":2213,"qnumday":792,"qnumall":"[13810\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200089#WRJJ05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will advise on a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied) in relation to dentists from the Ukraine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2214,"content":"<p>The Dental Council is very sympathetic to the plight of refugees from Ukraine and elsewhere, and has been actively considering ways in which it can support refugees holding dental qualifications seeking to register for practice in Ireland <\/p>  <p>  The Dental Council examination provides a route to registration for those holding dental qualifications issued outside the EU.

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Accordingly, the NTPF does not discuss publicly the details of negotiations with individual nursing homes. Neither Ministers nor the Department have a role in individual price negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic.

This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system.

The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.<\/p>  <p> Regarding the HRT patches, the suppliers have confirmed that they have increased the planned supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel\/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. With respect to the gels, the supplier of Divigel has indicated that it expects supply to resume next week (week beginning 21st March). Supply of an alternative gel product (Oestrogel) has recently run out and is expected to resume in April. In the interim, the companies have indicated that they are working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.<\/p>  <p>  The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within their regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised companies that they are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. HPRA are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200091#WRLL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":2308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200091#WRLL01300"},{"type":"question","counter":2309,"qnumday":824,"qnumall":"[13972\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200091#WRLL01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of general practitioner practices with capacity to accept new patients in counties Longford and Westmeath in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2310,"content":"<p>GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing.

The COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated the strong link between people&rsquo;s health, the capacity of our health and social care system, and the economy. My Department, and the Health Research Board (HRB) a statutory body which operates under the aegis of the Department Health, continuously builds linkages with European partners and stakeholders to integrate Ireland&rsquo;s participation in clinical trials internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, the Health Research Board (HRB) has been driving the growth of clinical trials in Ireland and putting in place the supporting research infrastructure with the overall aim of facilitating clinical trials in Ireland that can benefit patients, the healthcare system, and the economy. Facilities are located at hospital sites to enable the conduct of trials and intervention studies, to provide specialist support services and to link with clinical trial networks and to provide trial design and methodology supports. Clinical trial facilities provide a single point of access to resources, knowledge and skills, and are a key part of the national research landscape.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this vision, the Department of Health secured in 2018 Government approval to fund Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the ECRIN-ERIC network (European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network - a European Research Infrastructure Consortium) to increase access for Irish patients to multi-national clinical trials. ECRIN membership also makes it easier for Irish researchers to extend their own trials internationally and help improve patient safety and quality of care. Membership gives Irish researchers full access to all the tools and services within ECRIN-ERIC, such as trial preparation, protocol review, trial management, data centre certification, capacity building projects, and ECRIN supported trials. The HRB funds Irish membership of the ECRIN-ERIC network.  <\/p>  <p>  The HRB also provides the only dedicated funding stream (i.e., Definitive Interventions and Feasibility Awards) for clinical trials and interventions in Ireland, which supports studies evaluating a full scale, definitive trial of an intervention of any appropriate design to provide high quality evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness, cost and broad impact of the intervention. In the previous strategy (2016-2020) HRB made a total investment of &euro;22M across 33 studies. Applicants can apply for HRB funding for trials and interventions for rare diseases and given the importance of international collaboration for rare disease trials, HRB can also support costs for patients outside of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current strategy (2021-2025) the HRB will continue to invest in Clinical Research Facilities and centres nationally to improve the quality and quantity of trials in Ireland, to support a single point of access for multi-site clinical trials in Ireland (the National Clinical Trials Office) and to fund Clinical Trials Networks to bring groups of clinicians and patients together to enable trials.<\/p>  <p>  The HRB announced a new investment in a Rare Disease Clinical Trial Network (RD-CTN) on 28th February this year. The RD-CTN will allow people with rare disease greater opportunities for participation in the latest research and more access to innovative new therapies that will improve outcomes and transform treatment and care. The objectives of the RD-CTN are to act as a collaborative hub for trials in rare diseases, facilitate and support the conduct of trials in rare disease and increase the opportunities for patients to access high-quality clinical trials.<\/p>  <p>  This investment builds on prior investments by the HRB to advance research in rare diseases (&euro;14M in the last decade), including through the HRB-HRCI Joint Funding Scheme, our contribution to the work of IPPOSI, the European Joint Programme in Rare Diseases, European Joint Transnational Calls in Rare Diseases.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2022 (Minister Donnelly) welcomed news that Ireland is a new member of 15 European Reference Networks (ERNs), including one dedicated to rare neurological diseases, which supports Huntington&rsquo;s Disease. ERNs are virtual networks for clinicians and researchers across the EU to share expertise, knowledge and resources on rare diseases. ERNs convene virtual advisory panels of medical specialists across different disciplines, using a dedicated IT platform and telemedicine tools, to review a patient with a rare disease&rsquo;s diagnosis and treatment. They are important hubs for research on rare diseases and provide a basis for collaborative research across the EU, including for clinical trials.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with this development the HRB is engaged in the intensive discussions underway in Europe around a proposed Rare Diseases Partnership, which has the stated ambition of improving the health and well-being of people living with a rare disease by making Europe a world leader in innovation to address the unmet needs of 30 million persons living with a rare disease in Europe. An aim of the Partnership is to enable every consenting patient living with a rare disease to be findable and enrolled in a suitable clinical study; generating advances in prevention, diagnosis, understanding of diseases and developing treatments. Emphasis in these discussions has focused on how to overcome challenges associated with rare disease clinical studies and trials, how to create capacity and infrastructure to facilitate this, of the need for European clinical research networks working in this area and in particular networks that could leverage and expand the research capacities of ERNs.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the HRB-supported RD-CTN can build on the prior significant investment by the HRB in specialist clinical trial facilities, support services and networks, develop strong collaborative links through the European Reference Networks to further develop and support the research agenda in rare diseases and can support and complement the strategic agenda of the EU Rare Disease Partnership and all associated stakeholders and organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200092#WRMM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Eating Disorders","counter":2369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200092#WRMM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2370,"qnumday":844,"qnumall":"[14063\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200092#WRMM00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE is planning on an external recruitment drive, as in the past, in order to progress the clinical programme on eating disorders;

As well as national initiatives, Ireland (via the Health Research Board) is actively involved in the European Commission&rsquo;s health research response to the COVID-19 pandemic through the EU Framework Programmes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department plays a leading role in public health and medical research in Ireland. The Department supports research in these areas through the Health Research Board (HRB), a statutory body which operates under the aegis of the Department and a lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. The HRB supports the conduct of clinical research and clinical trials (in addition to health services research, population health research, and managing several national health information systems) on behalf of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  As the global COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, evidence emerged that some patients who survive the virus are experiencing prolonged symptoms and complications beyond the initial period of acute infection and illness. Termed Long COVID, it can present with clusters of symptoms that are often overlapping and fluctuating. Symptoms include breathlessness, headaches, cough, fatigue and cognitive impairment or &lsquo;brain fog&rsquo;, while there is also emerging evidence that some people experience organ damage. As yet, there are no clear indicators in research to suggest why one person may develop prolonged issues and another would not. Therefore, greater focus is now being placed on assessing this and the possible causes, in order that treatments and supports can be developed and in order to better understand any long-term consequences.<\/p>  <p>  Recent long-Covid studies include the following:<\/p>  <p>  Alimentary Pharmabotic Centre (APC) Microbiome Ireland in UCC conducted a study which has shown that the levels of multiple biomarkers are altered in serum from patients with long-Covid, even nine months after the initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Over 1,000 molecules were measured in patient serum, and a subset of these molecules were shown to be at different levels in patients compared to healthy volunteers. These differences indicate an ongoing activation of the immune system, which were coupled with differences in molecules generated during metabolism, gives some hints at what might be underpinning long term symptoms such as fatigue and brain fog. Overall, the study findings identify novel mechanistic and potential diagnostic markers as well as potential therapeutic targets in long-Covid patients. <\/p>  <p>  Another study, led by researchers from the Centre for Vascular Biology in the RCSI School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences published evidence showing that patients with long-Covid continue to have higher measures of blood clotting, which may help explain their persistent symptoms, such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue. Clotting markers were significantly elevated in the blood of patients with long-Covid syndrome compared with healthy controls and these clotting markers were higher in patients who required hospitalisation with their initial COVID-19 infection. Even those patients that were able to manage their illness at home still had persistently high clotting markers. The researchers observed that higher clotting was directly related to other symptoms of long-Covid syndrome, such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue. Even though markers of inflammation had all returned to normal levels, this increased clotting potential was still present in long-Covid patients. This work was funded through the Wellcome Trust-Health Research Board Irish Clinical Academic Training (ICAT) programme as well through a HRB-funded Irish COVID-19 Vasculopathy Study.<\/p>  <p>  Please also note the following information regarding other initiatives\/trials:<\/p>  <p>  The international peer review process is at an advanced stage for the HRB&rsquo;s largest project scheme, the 2022 Investigator Led Projects Scheme and this includes a number of grant applications focusing on long-Covid. The outcomes of this call will be available in June 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, with the support of the DoH and HRB, continues to participate in the WHO Solidarity PLUS trial. This is a platform trial that represents the largest global collaboration among WHO member states. It involves thousands of researchers in over 600 hospitals in 52 countries, including sites across Ireland. This allows the trial to assess multiple treatments at the same time using a single protocol, recruiting thousands of patients to generate robust estimates on the effect a drug may have on mortality-even moderate effects. It also allows new treatments to be added and ineffective treatments to be dropped throughout the course of the trial. Previously, four drugs were evaluated by the trial.

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases). <\/p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. <\/p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed. <\/p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines. <\/p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. <\/p>  <p>  Details of the proposed inquiry into the historical licensing and use of sodium valproate in Ireland, and the establishment of a related stakeholder group, are currently being considered by officials within the Department of Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes","counter":2508,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2509,"qnumday":890,"qnumall":"[14239\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if public respite beds are available at private nursing homes (details supplied).","asker":"1454","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2510,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2512,"qnumday":891,"qnumall":"[14243\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the updated timeline regarding the HIQA health technology assessment on a varicella vaccine; the frequency with which he is updated on the assessment process; if the assessment will be completed in 2022; if his Department is planning and budgeting for the addition of the varicella vaccine to the national immunisation programme in 2023, subject to a favourable health technology assessment outcome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2513,"content":"<p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).

Immunisation not only protects individuals, but also others in the community, by reducing the spread of disease.  I am fully committed to improving the immunisation uptake rates in the general population and am keen to ensure that vaccines are as accessible as possible, where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I very much appreciate the fundamental role community pharmacists play in the wider Irish Health Service in the delivery of holistic patient care and in supporting the direction of travel envisaged in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Currently, adult vaccinations are available either from a patient&rsquo;s General Practitioner (GP), a pharmacist or in the case of Covid19, at a Covid19 vaccination centre.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2011, pharmacists under the provisions of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 S.I. No. 525 of 2011, have been authorised to provide a seasonal influenza vaccination service in pharmacies, and to supply and administer adrenaline injections for the emergency treatment of anaphylactic shock that may arise from the administration of such vaccines. This legislation provides a framework whereby the authority to autonomously &ldquo;supply and administer&rdquo; specified prescription controlled medicinal products is given to pharmacists, in addition to the authority conferred in the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 to supply prescription controlled medicinal products of receipt of a prescription issued by a practitioner authorised to do so.   <\/p>  <p>  In 2015 the legislation was amended to permit pharmacists to &ldquo;supply and administer&rdquo; two additional vaccines, the pneumococcal polysaccharide and herpes zoster (shingles) vaccines. In 2020, in response to the Covid-19 Pandemic this authority was extended to allow pharmacists fully participate in the provision of vaccination services in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Thereafter the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. No.32\/2022) added an additional herpes zoster vaccine to those which pharmacists were authorised to supply and administer. <\/p>  <p>  The autonomous &ldquo;supply and administration&rdquo; of any vaccine by a pharmacist is subject to the completion of approved training by the pharmacist, and the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland as published and updated by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, which is the entity responsible for the regulation of pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland has produced guidance to support pharmacists in providing vaccination services in line with the legislation. It details the general requirements for providing vaccination services and additional considerations specific to the provision of each particular vaccination service. This governance framework is in place to assure trust and safety for all patients and the public on receipt of such services, and the consideration of any expansion of service will be subject to these criteria. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Pneumococcal vaccine, NIAC have recommended the Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) for those aged over 65 years and individuals in certain at-risk groups.  The Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) may also be prescribed for those in at risk groups.  These vaccines are available from an individual&rsquo;s GP. <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that there are no plans in place at present to review or revise the current vaccine provision arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2521,"content":"<p>Question No. 894 answered with Question No. 893.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":2522,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2523,"qnumday":895,"qnumall":"[14247\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200094#WROO02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his position regarding funding for a training post (details supplied);

Consideration of and options for the scope of a public funding model for advanced AHR treatment, including necessary considerations of eligibility criteria or the types of treatment to be provided, need to be developed further.  \u200e<\/p>  <p>  \u200eThe Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 has been introduced to the D&aacute;il, is scheduled for Second Stage this week and my priority is to ensure the progress of this Bill as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200095#WRPP03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2618,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200095#WRPP03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2619,"qnumday":931,"qnumall":"[14351\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200095#WRPP04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) will have to wait over two years for a hospital dental appointment for two extractions and other work in Cork;

Retention efforts by the HSE both nationally and locally are in place with significant career development and progression and educational\/development opportunities being offered. The Department is working with the National Doctors Training and Planning (NDTP) Office of the HSE in relation to medical workforce planning and initiatives aimed at increasing opportunities for training and career progression for trainee doctors.<b><\/b>Opportunities for training and career progression for doctors in the Irish Health system continue to evolve. Examples of the initiatives include: <\/p><p>- The Introduction of the online National Employment Record (NER) has now eliminated the requirement for duplication of paperwork associated with NCHD rotations. <\/p><p>- Enhanced Financial Supports: The Training Support Scheme (TSS), introduced in July 2019, provides reimbursement for approved exams, courses or conferences and is open to all NCHDs. Since July 2019 the full costs of approved examination\/courses are eligible for refund to NCHDs under the Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme (CCERS), this was previously capped at &euro;450. <\/p><p>- Greater predictability of the location of rotations are now provided to trainees at the outset of training. All newly appointed trainees receive a minimum of 2 years pre-defined rotations, a minimum of 13 weeks prior to commencing training\/entry to their training scheme, while trainees entering year 3 of a training scheme receive a minimum of 2 years pre-defined rotations a minimum of 13 weeks prior to commencing year 3 of the scheme. <\/p><p>- Increased rationalised training opportunities: A number of training schemes are moving towards more a regionalised structure of training. This is specialty dependent, but examples include the intern rotations which take place within a particular intern network and geographic location.<\/p><p>- Introduction of the Lead NCHD programme: The programme was introduced to provide a formal link at hospital management level between NCHDs and management, and to develop leadership capacity within NCHDs. The programme now runs across 32 acute hospitals, Community Health Organisations (CHOs), Public Health and Primary Care settings.<\/p><p>- NDTP have recently launched a new E-Portfolio \/ Logbook accessible to NCHDs via their National Employment Record. The principal objective of the E-Portfolio is to allow NCHDs who are not on a formal training scheme  access to a generic standard document to record their training and career development. It also provides the opportunity to have their experience validated by their supervising Consultant where applicable. <\/p><p>The HSE NDTP Office is in the initial stages of work regarding doctors who completed an internship in Ireland. Early and provisional data shows that a high percentage of medical interns who graduate leave Ireland for at least one year. However, the data shows that 82% of interns who commenced one year intern training in July 2015 subsequently commenced a Basic Specialist Training (BST) or General Practice (GP) training programme in subsequent years (2016-2021). A small number of the 2015 cohort also remain in the Irish health system either in service grade posts or employed within the private healthcare sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200098#WRSS06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":2825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2826,"qnumday":1004,"qnumall":"[14669\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to difficulties in accessing speech and language therapy and occupational therapy in CHO area 7; and the actions his Department is undertaking to improve resourcing of these therapies in CHO7.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2827,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2828,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2829,"qnumday":1005,"qnumall":"[14670\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if progress has been made in implementing a diagnostic centre to service CHO area 7; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2830,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2831,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2832,"qnumday":1006,"qnumall":"[14685\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects HIQA to complete its health technology assessment of the HPV vaccine catch-up programme for secondary school students who were previously eligible but missed or turned down the vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2833,"qnumday":1007,"qnumall":"[14686\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the scope of the HIQA health technology assessment of the HPV vaccine catch-up programme for students who were previously eligible but missed or turned down the vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2834,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1006 and 1007 together.<\/p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for the academic year 2020\/2021 was paused during the first few months of 2021 due to school closures and redeployment of staff to the COVID-19 immunisation programme. The inputting of uptake information for the schools-based programme was also delayed due to redeployment of administrative staff. The HSE has advised that the Schools Immunisation Programme 2020\/2021 (of which the HPV programme is included) has been completed across the country. This means that all those who were eligible to receive the HPV vaccine have now been offered it.<\/p>  <p>  The current recorded uptake rate for the first dose of the HPV vaccine, in the 2020\/2021 academic year, is 76%. The current recorded uptake rate for the second dose of the HPV vaccine in this academic year is 65%. It should be noted that some areas are yet to input some, or all, of their data for both dose 1 and 2 so these figures are expected to increase.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2835,"content":"<p>Question No. 1007 answered with Question No. 1006.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2837,"qnumday":1008,"qnumall":"[14687\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the latest HPV vaccine uptake rates for the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2838,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter for the HSE, I have referred the question to the HSE for a direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2839,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT01600"},{"type":"question","counter":2840,"qnumday":1009,"qnumall":"[14688\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the services that are in place and that are planned for persons who attended the Admire clinic in Cherry Orchard, Dublin for ADHD when they turn 18 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2841,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Heath Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":2842,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2843,"qnumday":1010,"qnumall":"[14689\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the lack of specialists in Huntington&rsquo;s disease services in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2844,"content":"<p>As this question is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2845,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT02200"},{"type":"question","counter":2846,"qnumday":1011,"qnumall":"[14691\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the waiting time persons in Limerick are experiencing for cataract operations in University Hospital Limerick forcing them to travel to the north of Ireland for this procedure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2847,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of February 2022 there were 5,043 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,276 in February 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.<\/p>  <p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.<\/p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised that they have provided funding for a number of insourcing initiatives to reduce Ophthalmology waiting lists at the University of Limerick Hospital Group in 2022 and to date in 2022, 2,500 patients have been approved for treatment through these initiatives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Recognition","counter":2848,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT02500"},{"type":"question","counter":2849,"qnumday":1012,"qnumall":"[14693\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the inordinate waiting times for assessments at the National Gender Service and the alternative, costly routes transgender persons are having to take as a result (details supplied); his views on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1512","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2850,"qnumday":1013,"qnumall":"[14694\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200099#WRTT02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a reply will issue to a transgender person (details supplied) regarding the temporal cost of waiting for hormone therapy here and the consequent financial cost of their seeking of alternative routes for same from the UK; the actions he will take on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1512","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2851,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1012 and 1013 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is committed to the development by the HSE of a well-governed and patient-centred health care service for adults and children in the transgender community, in line with the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

In 2021 some 20.4 million hours were provided to over 55,000 people. This is about 2.9 million more hours compared to 2020, an increase of 17%.<\/p>  <p>  It takes some time between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours, and certain regions are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability.  At the end of January 2022 there were 4,836 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available. This is a reduction from December 2021, when 5,322 were waiting for a carer to become available. At the end of January 274 were awaiting processing of funding approval, which is a reduction from  474 in December 2021, the previous month.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is endeavouring to prioritise service for clients with the highest care needs, to ensure that the service can commence for those who require it most urgently.  It is important to note that progress is being made in this area, and that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to approximately 5,110 by the end of January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I am very aware of the strategic workforce challenges in the home support and nursing homes sector, and I have held multiple meetings with relevant key stakeholders in recent months on these matters.

It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined.

Within this funding, &euro;497m is allocated for a range of public health and related infection prevention and control measures, including but limited to Testing &amp;amp; Tracing, Personal Protective Equipment and Vaccination programmes, with a further &euro;200m allocated to Waiting List measures.<\/p>  <p>  It is up to the HSE to allocate this funding across the relevant service areas as required throughout the year. In order to provide specific detail regarding the budget allocation and breakdown of same for the National Immunisation Office over the past four years, I will refer the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.  My Department is guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence in relation to the immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of research in relation to evaluating social and economic benefits, it is usual that the Health Information Quality Authority are asked by the Minister to carry out a Health Technology Assessment prior to a significant change or the introduction of a new vaccine to the national immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  A Health Technology Assessment (HTA) systematically gathers evidence under a series of domains to assist the decision-making process. The domains typically included are the burden of the disease, clinical effectiveness and safety, cost effectiveness and budget impact and ethical and legal issues.<\/p>  <p>  A HTA may be repeated in numerous countries, as each will have its own requirements regarding cost and epidemiological data. However, some elements of a HTA, such as the assessment of clinical effectiveness, may be transferable across jurisdictions. HIQA is involved in a collaboration of HTA agencies in Europe (EUnetHTA) which has the express purpose of improving information sharing and reducing duplication of work. The sharing of work is facilitated by using agreed methodology and processes when carrying out HTAs. Whenever possible, HIQA uses work carried out in other agencies as well as making their work available to them also. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA is also involved in other international collaborations, such as HTA International (HTAi), the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA), and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the regulatory framework, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for homecare and support providers in April 2021. The framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. Development of regulations are at an advanced level and public consultation is planned for Q2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services. <\/p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery Home Support Pilot is in progress in four pilot sites. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Home Support services are delivered directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) or through service arrangements with private providers.

A joint working group involving the HSE, and the Department of Health is in the process of being established to prepare the tender and ensure that it is in place from 1st January 2023.  As it is envisaged that the new tender will be in place before the statutory scheme comes into effect, the working group will consider options to accommodate this transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200102#WRWW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":3049,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200102#WRWW02700"},{"type":"question","counter":3050,"qnumday":1082,"qnumall":"[15007\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200102#WRWW02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will receive a date for surgery.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3051,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Animal identification systems in Ireland establish the location of animals, and the keeper responsible for the care of the animals. These systems are not concerned with the actual or beneficial ownership of animals. <\/p>  <p>  The rules on the identification and movement of terrestrial animals in the EU are contained in Commission Regulation 2019\/426 (Animal Health Law), supplemented by its implementing and delegated regulations. In acknowledgement of the more varied purposes for which equines are kept, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021\/963 sets out the rules for ensuring the uniform application of equine traceability across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's Animal Identification and Movements (AIM) database encompasses the central equine database and records the required identification and movement data of bovines, ovines, caprines, porcines and equines, as determined by the relevant EU legislation. <\/p>  <p>  The Animal Health Law has introduced a requirement to record the premises where equines are habitually kept. In this regard, and in keeping with my ongoing commitment to review and enhance the equine identification and traceability system, my Department undertook the first annual equine census in November 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The data returned in this context is currently being compiled and will be used to establish equine herd profiles for equine keepers, for the first time linking equines to the premises where they habitually reside. Further development of AIM is planned to provide equine keepers with a facility to update their own equine herd profile directly as equines move in and out of their premises.    <\/p>  <p>  Separate to the animal identification and movement systems, S.I. 201 of 2016 was introduced to enhance the traceability of equines as they move through the life cycle. This requires that, where the ownership of an equine is transferred, the person to whom ownership transfers must provide the new ownership details to the relevant approved equine Passport Issuing Organisation. The PIOS update this information on my Department's central equine database.  It is expected that the formal linking of equines to their keepers via the annual census and the ongoing updating of habitual residence of equines on AIM will increase compliance with S.I. 201 of 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200105#WRZZ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Slaughtering","counter":3257,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200105#WRZZ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":3258,"qnumday":1154,"qnumall":"[14982\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200105#WRZZ03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the average kill out percentage of each grade of cattle, that is, E, U, R, O and P based on slaughter and dissection studies completed by Teagasc; the minimum and maximum kill out percentage for each respective grade in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":3259,"qnumday":1155,"qnumall":"[14983\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200105#WRZZ04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the average bone out percentage of each of grade of cattle, that is, E, U, R, O and P based on slaughter and dissection studies completed by Teagasc in tabular form; the average percentage of saleable meat per carcass in each of the relevant grades; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3260,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1154 and 1155 together.<\/p><p>There are several different factors affecting the kill out percentages of cattle which include the following:<\/p><p>- Level of meal feeding <\/p><p>- Breeding <\/p><p>- Gender<\/p><p>- Age at kill out<\/p><p>- Conformation at kill out (better grades higher KO)<\/p><p>- Slaughter weight. <\/p><p>The Table below provides our best estimates of the Kill Out ranges, are based on the Beef Production System guidelines produced by Teagasc and relate to animals fit for slaughter.

The Appropriate Assessment procedures and subsequent mitigation measures in place today go beyond those envisaged in the NIS published at the end of 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Policy documents such as &lsquo;Environmental Requirements for Afforestation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Standards for Felling and Reforestation&rsquo; published in 2016 and 2019 respectively underpin my Department&rsquo;s approach to protecting European sites, giving a baseline of good practice helping to ensure that the conservation status of qualifying interests will not be adversely affected by the forestry operations being proposed. Publication of &lsquo;Forests &amp;amp; Water Achieving Objectives under Ireland&rsquo;s River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021&rsquo;, and &lsquo;AA Procedure Guidance Note &amp;amp; iFORIS SOP for DAFM Forestry Inspectors (2019)&rsquo; are other important documents that help the Department protect European sites. <\/p>  <p>  Geographic Information Systems (GISs) and associated technologies play a major role today in how my Department ensures that European Sites are protected when forestry operations are being carried out. This allows for all proposed projects to be assessed in terms of their proximity to European sites and their associated species and habitats. For example, Hydrological connectivity is assessed at individual site level and this assessment is aided by using the latest EPA GIS data which includes sub catchment data and rivers.  <\/p>  <p>  DAFMs mitigations in relation to the Hen harrier are based on a protocol agreed with the NPWS. Datasets identifying High Likelihood Nesting Areas are regularly updated by the NPWS and the Department is able to immediately update its QGIS systems to ensure that the appropriate measures are applied to the latest data on breeding Hen harriers in SPAs designated for Hen Harriers. Ecologists assessing files have access to this dedicated Ecological QGIS system. Other datasets available in the QGIS system include the Semi-natural grassland survey layer, non-designated hen harrier areas and curlew breeding buffer layer. OSI&rsquo;s  prime 2 water body dataset was also added to the Departments GIS system within the last 12 months.  <\/p>  <p>  My Departments&rsquo; data requirements for both statutory and non-statutory designated sites are subject to continuous review and improvement. This includes NPWS data which is updated regularly. Almost 90 amendments have been made to datasets used by my Department since the Forestry Programmes NIS was published in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also strengthened its staff resource in the field of ecology, with a strong emphasis on Appropriate Assessment since the NIS was published. Currently, there are 36 ecologists employed by the Department where only one ecologist was employed by the Department when the Forestry programme NIS was written. There are over 40 Forestry Inspectors.  In 2018, the Forestry Inspectors and all Registered Foresters received Annex 1 habitat training, and further Habitat training is planned.  <\/p>  <p>  The SEA environmental report concluded that with the adoption of the listed mitigation measures it was anticipated that none of the effects identified as adverse in the detailed matrix assessment will be of greater than negligible significance and ensure that, even without adoption of enhancement measures, the overall effect of the Forestry Programme is strongly positive. In keeping with the SEA obligations, my Department undertakes monitoring in relation to the implementation of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 in relation to all sites and not just those designated as European sites. This monitoring is carried out inter alia in order to be able to identify at an early stage any unforeseen adverse effects and to be able to undertake appropriate remedial action.<\/p>  <p>  The monitoring programme is ongoing and includes the use of information collated in relation to projects approved under the programme. In this regard significant data is available on the Departments website including the Forestry Division Monthly reports detailing information about  afforestation, roads, woodland Improvement and Reconstitution and Underplanting of woodlands schemes.  Species composition is provided in the Forest Statistics Ireland annual publication also available on the Departments website. The Department&rsquo;s forest licence viewer provides access to view the location of public and private forests as well as proposed forests and proposed roads.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department also monitor information provided by other sources, i.e. from other existing monitoring and reporting arrangements arising from EU legislation other than the SEA Directive and from national legislation or policies, and which can be indirectly used for purpose of monitoring for significant environmental effects arising from the implementation of the programme. Also, the reports required under Article 17 of the habitats Directive on &lsquo;The status of EU protected habitats and species in Ireland&rsquo; and the implementation of the measures taken under the Habitats Directive are reported upon to the European Commission every 6 years. The latest report was published in 2019 and recognises &ldquo;the improved consideration of the type and location of planting&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The EPA are the national competent authority for the Water Framework Directive and associated implementing Regulations. The national Water Framework Directive monitoring programme for Ireland for the period 2019-2021, undertaken by the EPA is comprised of 3,169 surface and groundwater bodies. My Department is listed as a relevant public authority under the First Schedule of the S.I. and the Forestry Inspectorate, accordingly, actively engage with the EPA. The EPA waterbodies and High-Status Objective Waterbodies layers are provided to the Forestry Inspectorate by the EPA, and form part of the consideration of licence assessments. The most up to date layer on WFD status and pressures was provided to the DAFM Forestry Division as soon as it became available on 28th February this year, and is being added to the IFORIS system where it will be a central part of the licence assessment process. In addition, the Forestry Inspectorate participate on several working groups and committees established under the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, including the National Technical Implementation Group, the Blue Dot Programme and all 5 Regional Operational Committees. My Department&rsquo;s Forestry Division is a participant of the largescale Waters of Life Integrated Project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200105#WRZZ05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3271,"content":"<p>Question No. 1158 answered with Question No. 1157.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3272,"content":"<p>Question No. 1159 answered with Question No. 1157.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3273,"content":"<p>Question No. 1160 answered with Question No. 1157.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":3274,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200105#WRZZ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":3275,"qnumday":1161,"qnumall":"[15077\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032200105#WRZZ05600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a long overdue transfer of entitlement will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3276,"content":"<p>Further information needed to allow processing of this application was sought on three separate occasions during 2018 and 2019 but was not provided.

My Department has recently provided an update to the Joint Committee on the recommendations outlined in the report as relevant to my Department. I have provided the updates requested on the relevant recommendations as follows:<\/p><p><b>Recommendation 50:<\/b>Greater supports should be provided to social enterprises - these could include a community asset transfer policy to enable community organisations and social enterprises to make a request for land and buildings from local authorities and other public bodies.  An additional funding stream should be established for CSP places for Traveller Projects particularly for new start up social enterprises. <\/p><p><b>DRCD response to recommendation 50:<\/b>Each year my Department provides funding for social enterprise from the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF). This year the available funding will again be &euro;2.3m. In 2021 DAF funding was used to provide small capital grants to 250 social enterprises, and 50 organisations received funding to develop programmes to raise awareness of social enterprise locally, regionally and nationally. 25 social enterprises also received funding under a start-up scheme for new social enterprises, and a training and mentoring scheme is providing support post-Covid for social enterprises nationwide. <\/p><p>My Department is now considering how the funding will be spent in 2022.<\/p><p><b>DRCD Response to recommendation 50 re Community Services Programme (CSP):<\/b>CSP) supports community based organisations to provide local services to disadvantaged communities and target groups, through a social enterprise model. The CSP focuses on communities where public and private sector services are lacking, either through geographical or social isolation or because demand levels are not sufficient. <\/p><p>Since the CSP was designed in 2006 emerging from the former Social Economy Programme, there have been major economic and social changes in Ireland. Therefore, when responsibility for CSP was transferred from the then Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to my Department of Rural and Community Development, my Department appointed Indecon International Economic Consultants to undertake an independent review of the CSP with the report published in September 2020, which contained 11 key recommendations and examined, among other things: <\/p><p>- options for expanding the range of eligible services and participants,<\/p><p>- how funding might be provided to a greater number of applicants,<\/p><p>- options for restructuring the scheme having regard to the range and scale of organisations supported by the programme, <\/p><p>- the scope to refine or expand eligible activities to strengthen synergies with other programmes, and<\/p><p>- the types and levels of CSP support.<\/p><p>The Indecon report outlines that service provision can help empower local communities and can directly assist in reducing social exclusion among marginalised groups.  Indecon recommends in the report that targets are set for the horizontal objective of the programme to achieve increased employment for disadvantaged groups, and acknowledges that there is a need to provide a greater level of financial support to organisations employing individuals from disadvantaged or marginalised groups who are more distant from the labour market, such as members of the Traveller Community.<\/p><p>Indecon also recommendations that rates of funding and eligibility criteria should be tailored to reflect variance in each sub programme area. For projects focused on enhancing social inclusion and support for sustainable communities, resource prioritisation should be informed by levels of social disadvantage. <\/p><p>My Department and Pobal are currently working on the restructuring of the programme, in collaboration with a Consultative Group, whose membership is secured from key sectoral stakeholders including CSP supported organisations, national organisations, community representatives and social enterprise representatives, with a view to having it finalised by end of 2022.<\/p><p>Pending the transition to the new restructured programme, the scheme is closed to new applications through the expression of interest process.  However, it is anticipated that the Programme will open calls to address identified gaps in service delivery in 2022. Funding for additional new entrants will be considered in light of available budgets, during the year. <\/p><p><b>Recommendation 51:<\/b>The Community Services Programme should be expanded with a particular focus on areas where there are a large number of Travellers living to give Travellers who are not employed or have not been employed a positive experience of employment. <\/p><p><b>DRCD response to recommendation to 51 re CSP<\/b>: The Community Services Programme (CSP) currently supports over 420 community based organisations to provide employment opportunities for specific disadvantaged individuals and to provide local social, economic and environmental services to disadvantaged communities and target groups, through a social enterprise model. The different types of services supported by CSP seek to address vital societal concerns such as inequality, marginalisation and deprivation, as well as contributing to healthy, safe and vibrant communities across Ireland.  <\/p><p>One of the objectives of the CSP Programme is to create sustainable jobs for those most distant from the labour market, in particular for those who are long-term unemployed and from specific target groups one of which is the Traveller community. <\/p><p>CSP guidelines mandate that 70% of all CSP-supported FTE contract positions (excluding managers) should be filled by individuals from designated target groups.  The current CSP Operating Manual references Travellers wherein it states that 70% of supported FTEs must be drawn from named target groups, one of which is &ldquo;Travellers in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments or One Parent Family Payment&rdquo; - this applies to all strands of the programme.  In addition to this, Strand 3 of the current programme (companies employing people who are distant from the labour market) specifically targets those most distant from the labour market and one of the named target groups for this strand is Travellers.<\/p><p>According to the information provided by the CSP organisations as part of the December 2020 returns, there were 69 CSP workers employed via 20 CSP supported organisations who self-identified as members of the Traveller community, the December 2021 returns are currently being collated. <\/p><p>Indecon International Economic Consultants undertook an independent review of the CSP on behalf of the Department. It recommends, in the published report, that targets are set for the horizontal objective of the programme to achieve increased employment for disadvantaged groups. It also recommends that the existing supports should be amended to provide a tailored package of supports reflecting the differentiated requirements for funding under each sub-programme.<\/p><p>My Department and Pobal are currently working on the restructuring of the programme, in collaboration with a Consultative Group.  It is planned that the restructuring will deliver a renewed and clearer vision for CSP that is aligned with the strategic objectives of the Department. It will also help the programme to maximise its impact in terms of reducing social disadvantage and building more sustainable communities.  In the interim, all existing CSP contracts are extended up to end December 2022 pending the transition to the new restructured programme, which is anticipated to roll out in early 2023.  <\/p><p><b>Recommendation 64:<\/b>Local Development Companies should take specific actions to increase uptake of programmes by Travellers that result in employment opportunities.<\/p><p><b>DRCD response to recommendation 64:<\/b>In relation to recommendation 64, the LEADER sub-theme of Provision of Basic Services Targeted at Hard to Reach Communities, already strategically focuses on improving access to basic services for people living in rural and remote areas and groups who are at risk of social exclusion. In some cases, it might involve the introduction of a new service or the re-introduction of a previously withdrawn service under the following categories; community, education\/training, social\/cultural and recreation. Examples of groups who may be at risk of social exclusion include, but are not limited to, those living in disadvantaged areas, those living in remote and less accessible areas, migrants\/new communities and Travellers. To date, the LEADER Local Action Groups (LAGs) have approved a total of 9 Traveller related projects worth in excess of &euro;220,000. The overarching aim of these projects is to build the capacity of these individuals to enable them to progress on to existing mainstream education\/employment or training services. <\/p><p><b>DRCD further supports under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP 2018 &ndash; 2022):<\/b>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP 2018 &ndash; 2022) is the Irish Government&rsquo;s primary social inclusion programme. It is funded by the Irish Government through my Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD) and co-funded by the European Social Fund. Travellers are named as one of SICAP&rsquo;s target groups.<\/p><p><b>Goal 1<\/b>: <b>Supporting communities:<\/b>SICAP provides supports to communities and target groups to engage with relevant stakeholders in identifying and addressing social exclusion and equality issues, developing the capacity of local community groups (LCGs) and creating more sustainable communities.<\/p><p>To date (2018-2021), SICAP has supported <b>93 Local Community Groups (LCGs)<\/b>that name Travellers as their primary target group.

This accounts for 2% of total number of individuals supported (86,641). The types of supports received are as follows; personal skills, wellbeing and capabilities supports, information about life-long learning opportunities, labour supports and ongoing in-work supports.<\/p><p>In May 2021 I, in my role as Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development &amp;amp; Department of Social Protection, wrote to every government Minister asking each to place particular emphasis on the disadvantaged situation of Travellers when putting forward their proposed measures under the 2022 Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF). <\/p><p>2022 DAF Allocations of &euro;55.5 million are approved.
