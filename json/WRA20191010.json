Any child thought to have a disability, born on, or after June 1st, 2002 is eligible to apply for an 'Assessment of Need' that will detail his or her health needs arising from a disability.\u00a0 Since its commencement in 2007, there have been significant year on year increases in the number of children applying both for an 'Assessment of Need' and for disability services generally. Regrettably, these increases have led to the extended waiting periods currently being experienced by children and their families.<\/p>  <p>  In order to improve the 'Assessment of Need' process and ensure that children receive an intervention as soon as possible, the HSE has developed a new Standard Operating Procedure for the Assessment of Need process. This measure will ensure children with disabilities and their families, access appropriate assessment and intervention as soon as possible, while at the same time bringing consistency to the Assessment of Need process in each Community Healthcare Organization of the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE\u00a0 is currently concluding a lengthy consultation and Industrial Relations engagement regarding the implementation of this procedure which it hopes to have in place by the first quarter of 2020. In addition, HSE Disability Services is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).<\/p>  <p>  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.\u00a0 Evidence to date from areas where this has been rolled out shows that implementation of this programme will also have a positive impact on waiting lists both for Assessments of Need and therapy provision.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, an increase in therapy posts was identified as a priority requirement to meet current unmet need and projected future needs in children's disability services nationally. In that regard, last year's Budget provided for the recruitment of an additional 100 therapy posts to help reduce the long waiting times for assessment as well as supporting interventions for children who need them. The recruitment process for these posts is well underway and a number of posts have been filled. This welcome new resource will result in additional new therapy posts ranging from Speech and Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Social Workers and Psychologists.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that timely access to assessments and therapies is imperative in a child&rsquo;s development and I fully understand how delays in accessing the service are a source of great concern for both children and their families and while not addressing all needs, I am confident the initiatives I have outlined will have a significant positive impact in reducing waiting times for Assessment of Need over the course of the next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000048#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Question No. 14 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000048#WRA01300"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[41200\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000048#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the large increase in the number waiting more than 18 months for an outpatient appointment in the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore since May 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures is a key commitment of government.

The HSE\u00a0Management Data Report (MDR) reports on HSE activity against Key Performance Indicators\u00a0as set out in the National Service Plan for 2019. Under the National Service Plan 2019, the target for all hospital groups, including Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI), is for 80% of people to wait less than 52 weeks for a\u00a0first Outpatient Department appointment. \u00a0<\/p><p>The last published MDR figures are\u00a0for June 2019\u00a0and report\u00a0that\u00a060% of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment at CHI hospitals are waiting 52 weeks or less. Furthermore, the NSP target for Outpatient Activity (including both new and return appointments)\u00a0for CHI for 2019 is 145,766 appointments for the full year. The target to the end of June was\u00a073,274 while actual activity to the end of June was recorded in the MDR as\u00a055,528. In addition, the target for new:return appointments for CHI for 2019 is 1:2.3. As of the end of June, CHI reported a ratio of 1:2.4.<\/p><p>CHI has advised that it is committed to reducing waiting lists and supporting initiatives that ensure that children receive care appropriately and in a timely manner, and in 2019 a number of initiatives were put in place to address Outpatient Waiting Lists.<\/p><p>For example, the new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre in CHI at Connolly opened on 31<sup>st<\/sup>July 2019. This new facility offers a range of services to children and their families in the local area as well as those in Dublin North city and county and the surrounding areas in Kildare and Meath. General Paediatric Clinics are held from 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday. CHI has advised that the opening of CHI at Connolly is having a positive impact on CHI OPD waiting lists. At the end of September 2019, there were 4,130 patients on CHI&rsquo;s General Paediatric Outpatient waiting list, which is a 35% reduction when compared to the same period last year. <\/p><p>Furthermore, CHI at Connolly will provide a further 1,300 outpatient appointments between September and December 2019. CHI advise that they are\u00a0currently in the process of expanding these clinics to provide a focus on the specific requirements for some patients including asthma, allergy, faltering growth and constipation. When fully operational, CHI at Connolly is expected to provide 17,000 outpatient appointments (General Paediatrics and Orthopaedic clinics) every year  <b>. <\/b><\/p><p>Management of referrals is a key enabler to reducing waiting lists, and in this regard CHI advise that they have initiated a referrals process whereby all referrals from the three children&rsquo;s hospitals are managed centrally. The group is progressing its ICT requirements to have a single Patient Administration System across all CHI sites (the three children&rsquo;s hospitals and CHI at Connolly). <\/p><p>The central referrals team, through administrative and clinical validation are ensuring that all appointment slots are used appropriately and that where appropriate, patients are removed from the waiting list, which is assisting in the waiting list reduction.<\/p><p>Another example of innovation in referral pathways is the TORC project (Triage of Referral Clinics). This is one of a number of virtual clinics currently being held across CHI and involves the active triage of referrals, the provision of advice and commencement of treatment for patients. As a result, patients may then either not have to attend an outpatient clinic appointment or can begin their pathway of care prior to attendance. CHI advise that this has been very successful in achieving a discharge rate of up to 30% of patients contacted. In addition, patients can begin their diagnostics prior to attending an appointment which ensures the best use of resources and reduction in follow-up attendances for patients and their families. <\/p><p>CHI is continuing with a number of other initiatives including moving Dermatology referrals towards a more centralised structure together with a virtual clinic model in this specialty. <\/p><p>CHI continues to engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to secure funding for initiatives in 2019 to address access to patients for specialties including ENT, Ophthalmology, General Paediatrics, Orthopaedics and Gastroenterology. <\/p><p>CHI advises that recruitment of additional consultants for CHI specialties with the longest OPD waiting times (Allergy, Dermatology, Radiology, Gastroenterology, Rheumatology, Orthopaedics &amp;amp; ENT) is also underway following CHI securing additional National Service Plan funding in 2019. In appointing these positions, the multidisciplinary teams are also reviewing their current work practices and identifying new ways of working to ensure appropriate management of waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000050#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000050#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[41232\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000050#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a report on the works at St. Joseph's Community Hospital, Millstreet; the timeframe for its completion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive recently published its Capital Plan for 2019-2021.

The Department, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), with the full support of stakeholders, are implementing a comprehensive and coordinated set of preparations to ensure continuity of treatment and care for patients in Ireland in the event of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  I refer Deputy Durkan to Chapter 24 of the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan for Brexit, updated in July 2019, which specifically details work underway in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is unlikely to face general medicine shortages in the period immediately after\u00a031 October. Any emerging supply issues will, in the first instance, be dealt with from existing supplies held within the domestic distribution chain, which has already has additional stocks of medicines routinely built into it. This is different to the wholesaling model which operates in the UK. The pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers have provided assurances that they are confident that they will have sufficient stocks to bridge any initial issues at ports, should they occur.<\/p>  <p>  As a result there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions, as doing so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients. Patients should continue to fill their prescriptions and take their medications as they normally would.<\/p>  <p>  My department, the HSE and the HPRA have facilitated ongoing engagements with manufacturers and suppliers of medicines and medical devices, to ensure that they are Brexit-ready, to discuss any potential issues that could affect supply to Ireland and to identify solutions to maintain supply to the market.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these measures undertaken at industry, national and EU level, Brexit is not expected to have an immediate impact on the supply of medicines in Ireland. However, given the size of our market, Brexit may cause those with a small share of a particular medicine market to consider the ongoing viability of supply to Ireland. However, it is considered that any such products are unlikely to be critical to continuity of care, as there are and will be alternative suppliers or therapeutic alternatives available. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, medicine shortages are a feature of modern health systems, but Ireland has a multi-stakeholder system in place to prevent and manage shortages when they occur. Any shortages currently affecting the Irish market are not directly attributable to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA has worked with stakeholders, including the HSE, to develop an effective approach to the management of medicine shortages in Ireland. In 2018 the HPRA launched the &ldquo;Medicine Shortages Framework&rdquo;, which is built in a pragmatic and collaborative approach involving the wide range of stakeholders within the medicine supply chain. The HPRA coordinates all stakeholders to share information in order to prevent or mitigate the impact of medicine shortages when they occur. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  As an additional safeguard, consideration continues to be given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health. The HSE and HPRA are continuing to undertake criticality assessments, seeking additional and updated assurances from stakeholders, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers and healthcare professionals, to verify contingency planning to date and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives for those products most critical to public health with potential to be vulnerable to supply issues. <\/p>  <p>  Manufacturers and suppliers of medicines have been asked to further review their supply chain for products that travel from or through the UK, determine any products or services that are certified for compliance with EU standards by a UK body and communicate any potential vulnerabilities to the Department of Health, HPRA or HSE. No major issues have been identified through this process. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While there can be no absolute guarantees following a no deal Brexit, significant work has been undertaken to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and risks to provide this high level of assurance around continuity of care and treatment for patients in Ireland. Work on this will continue up to, and in the months following, Brexit.

Since December 2017, an additional 25 beds have opened in University Hospital Limerick, including 8 which opened at the start of this year as part of the 2018\/2019 Winter Plan. <\/p>  <p>  A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at University Hospital Limerick, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019.

This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the National Development Plan includes a 96-bed replacement ward block in University Hospital Limerick and capital funding was provided in 2018 to progress the design phase of the project. A design team has been appointed for this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000051#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Action Plans","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000051#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[41368\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000051#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he is taking to reduce the time persons are spending on ophthalmology waiting lists in counties Cork and Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to reducing waiting times for procedures in hospitals and\u00a0has provided\u00a0funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to deliver on this commitment. Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. Under the plan there has been a continued effort to improve patient access for certain high-volume procedures, including cataracts. The NTPF procures capacity for each of the procedures identified in the Action Plan, including cataract procedures,\u00a0in both private hospitals or public hospitals. The Action Plan also strikes the appropriate balance between maximising the number of patients treated in both public and private capacity, as appropriate, and ensuring the best return for the taxpayer. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Inpatient Day Case Access Plans for\u00a02018 and 2019, cataracts were one of the specialties targeted by the NTPF, and by end of September 2019, the number of people waiting nationally for a cataract procedure had almost halved, from 10,024 in July 2017 to 5,074. In this same period, there has also been a reduction of 88% in the number of patients waiting over 9 months for a cataract operation. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the number of patients awaiting cataract surgery in Cork and Kerry, data provided by South South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) at the beginning of September, shows that of 499 patients waiting, 349 (70%) were waiting less than 6 months.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the SSWHG has advised that the NTPF has approved funding for 401 patients to receive cataract surgery with an external provider in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the IPDC Action Plan 2018, a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre was opened by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital, in November 2018. This initiative continues to have a positive impact in reducing waiting times for patients waiting for cataract procedures, especially in the mid-west. Given the central location of Nenagh Hospital it is envisaged that, in time, it has the potential to provide capacity for cataract surgery for patients on waiting lists in public hospitals in the surrounding geographical areas. The HSE has advised that University Limerick Hospital Group is working collaboratively with the South South West Hospital Group to review over 1,000 patients on Ophthalmology waiting lists that may be suitable for cataract procedures in Nenagh.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in line with the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare, I have asked the HSE and NTPF to work together this year with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. A Working Group comprised of representatives from the HSE, NTPF, and Departmental officials, has been established to examine ways of improving access for patients waiting for scheduled care. Part of this work included examining initiatives which would move care to the most appropriate setting, and at the lowest level of complexity, such as providing ophthalmology in the community.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. The year-on-year increases to the NTPF since Budget 2017 reflects this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. In this regard, the HSE National Service Plan 2020 will set out a planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to reduce inpatient\/day case waiting times, and with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, the NTPF will further expand its list of targeted inpatient and daycase procedures to support further significant reductions in wait times as well as increasing funding towards supporting full packages of care for patients on the outpatient waiting lists, to include surgery or treatment where required.\u00a0  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000051#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000051#WRD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[41170\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000051#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an independent clinical review will be launched into recent reports of apparent failings in the care provided to a number of women at the gynaecology department, Letterkenny University Hospital, County Donegal.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>I have been advised that the Saolta Healthcare Group will conduct a review of the safety and quality of gynaecology services in Letterkenny University Hospital, led by an independent chairperson.

To qualify for tax relief under that section, any travelling expenses must be necessarily incurred, and any other employment-related expenses must be wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred, in the performance of the duties of the relevant employment and must not be reimbursed by the employer. The FRE regime eases the administrative burden on Revenue and on employees in certain sectors by facilitating the automatic granting of a fixed tax allowance to cover allowable employment-related expenses, without the need for annual claims by every employee concerned.  It is important to note, however, that the regime does not preclude any employee from making an individual claim for a tax allowance in respect of employment-related expenses, where those expenses meet the statutory requirement for such an allowance.    Therefore, while certain employees may no longer claim a deduction on a universal &ldquo;flat rate&rdquo; basis, they may still be able to still claim a deduction on a specific &ldquo;vouched basis&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that over the past 18 months, Revenue has been conducting a comprehensive review of the FRE regime.  Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the FRE review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category of FRE allowance is being examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements.  The review will result in increases and decreases in several FRE categories and the withdrawal of the right to avail of an FRE allowance in some categories.  An FRE allowance can only be retained to the extent that there is a legislative basis to support the right to tax deductibility in respect of the expense.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that its review is now nearing conclusion. As previously advised, the implementation date for all changes to the FRE regime will be 1 January 2020 to make sure that employees in any one sector are not impacted on earlier than employees of another sector.  Revenue will be publishing a comprehensive list of all FRE allowances for 2020 in advance of the implementation date.  It is not appropriate, in advance of the finalisation of the review and the publication of the list, to indicate the employment categories which will be subject to increases or decreases in the FRE allowance amount or which no longer meet the legislative basis for deductibility. <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that it is not possible to accurately quantify the anticipated increase in tax revenue arising out of any abolition or reduction of FRE allowances, as the cost of such allowances vary depending on the particular circumstances of the individual recipients, for example, the extent of their income subject to tax and whether income is subject to tax at the standard or marginal rate. Moreover, a breakdown of the cost and numbers by reference to each employment category in which the FRE regime currently operates is not readily available. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, on the question of whether I have discussed the FRE review with Revenue, I can confirm that I am aware of Revenue&rsquo;s programme of work in this area and I understand that the purpose of the review is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  As the Deputy will be aware, the administration of the tax code is exclusively a matter for Revenue who are independent in the performance of their functions.  Any changes in practice to the flat rate expenses regime are therefore a matter for Revenue, but I understand that any withdrawal of the practice can only take place if Revenue are satisfied that there is no longer a legally valid basis to give the concession, after engagement with the relevant representative body acting on behalf of the various categories of workers.<\/p>  <p>  Having said this, I expect that Revenue as they have demonstrated on many occasions will implement the outcome of their review in their customary proportionate and fair manner fully cognisant of the impact on the individuals concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000052#WRE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme Data","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000052#WRE01900"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[41434\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000052#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of help-to-buy grant approvals on a monthly basis since the scheme was launched; the number of drawdowns in this regard since the scheme was introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>The Help To Buy tax incentive (HTB), announced in Budget 2017 and backdated to 19 July 2016, is designed to assist first-time buyers with the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home. <\/p><p>HTB has a two main stages: the application stage and the claim stage.

Unfortunately, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to the leisure sector as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as those in the leisure sector.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, I cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I wish to re-emphasise however that this issue remains a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and has produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report<\/i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report<\/i>.  The latter report in particular makes it clear the impact that the cost of insurance is having on the leisure and other sectors and this position has been reinforced by Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s continuing engagement with the sector. Therefore, there is a clear understanding of the impact of this problem on the leisure sector and there is a recognition that the single most essential challenge which must be addressed if we are to overcome it is a sustainable reduction in insurance costs. <\/p><p>In this regard, the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced. This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales. The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the Judicial Council Act.  This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly.<\/p><p>Other steps take to date to address the spiralling cost of insurance include the following: <\/p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 <\/i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;<\/p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; <\/p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, and;<\/p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;<\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).

vital contributors to action on climate change. Currently, Ireland has 11 per cent of forest cover, up from just 1 per cent a century ago, and intends achieving 18 per cent cover by 2050.\u00a0 This proposed venture between Coillte and Bord na Mona will help achieve these targets in line with our commitments under the Climate Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  My Department published a paper in 2010 through the Council for Forestry Research and Development, COFORD, called &ldquo;The greenhouse gas balance of peatland forests&rdquo;. This paper highlighted the dynamics at play with regard to peatlands and peatland forests and their capacity to both emit carbon while also acting as an important carbon sink. This dynamic depends on site conditions, peat type and peatland development stage. Cutaway bogs, for example, which are the peatland type to be planted under the Coillte\/Bord na Mona project, are understood to be emitting carbon on an ongoing basis as they already have been drained and as such the peat is subject to ongoing decomposition. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the woodland types planned as part of the Coillte\/Bord na Mona project, it is very difficult to provide an accurate assessment of the potential greenhouse gas balance of these new forests. Applications to begin planting have not yet been submitted to my Department for consent. Coillte and Bord na Mona are currently assessing a number of sites and will prepare an application which will include details of the location and extent of native woodland proposed. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, based on research on the subject of carbon balance, it is reasonable to conclude that Woodland creation will accelerate the restoration of the carbon sink function on these peatland sites through new carbon stocks in biomass, woody debris and litter. The extent to which it does will depend on the relative balance between carbon uptake and loss. The proposed woodland creation on the Bord na Mona lands is one of a suite of land use options, which includes rewetting. Woodland creation as proposed represents a small area of the overall Bord na Mona land holding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000056#WRJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Exports","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000056#WRJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[41424\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000056#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the efforts being made to secure and source existing and new markets for live cattle exports.","asker":"1257","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>In 2018, total live exports of cattle increased by over 30% compared to 2017, to 246,000 head. This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports already totalling 247,000 up until week commencing the 9th September. This is up from 207,000 for the same period in 2018 &ndash; a 19% increase. I  welcome the recent live cattle shipments to both Turkey and Libya.  <\/p>  <p>  Live exports are a critical part of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry.  They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers. My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its importance to the agri-food sector, while placing a strong emphasis on the welfare of all animals being transported.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to prioritise efforts to deepen existing markets and gain access to new third country markets.  In 2017, my Department reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal, from &euro;4.80.  This gave an important boost to the trade in young calves, and brought greater equity in the fees payable for calves, weanlings and adult cattle.<\/p>  <p>  In April, my Department reached agreement with the Egyptian authorities on three proposed health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle. <\/p>  <p>  Also in April, agreement was reached in principle with Algeria to move from a joint breeding, slaughter and fattening certificate to three separate certificates. We are awaiting the Algerian authorities&rsquo; imprimatur prior to the commencement of the revised trade conditions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Turkey, my Department hosted a visit in May by a technical team that included officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and ESK (the Turkish Meat and Milk Board). <\/p>  <p>  With regard to lairage capacity in Cherbourg, my Department worked closely with the French authorities, and earlier this year, the French authorities approved an increase in holding capacity of the Qualivia in Cherbourg.  This provided for additional daily capacity for 400 animals, providing increased capacity of some 1, 200 animals per week. <\/p>  <p>  A successful live export trade relies on the cooperation of a multitude of stakeholders. Therefore, the recent establishment of the Irish Livestock Exporters' Association is to be welcomed. This body can represent the industry&rsquo;s views, not just to my Department, but also to ferry companies, port authorities, lairage operators and other stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  At its request, I met the new Association in September to discuss a number of industry concerns.  I briefed the representative body on the progress made by my Department to source new markets as outlined above and I look forward to further engagement with the group in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000056#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Organic Farming","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000056#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[41425\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000056#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the level of increase in organic production since 2011 and the incentives that are available to encourage same.","asker":"1257","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>The area of land under organic production has expanded significantly under the current Rural Development Programme, thanks to the suite of supports that have been put in place.

The Government's Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, as published in May last year,\u00a0sets out the range of policy objectives across the key thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing that will be pursued between now and 2025.<\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0relation to\u00a0the specific recommendations relating to the introduction of a BER style water conservation rating for buildings, and measures to promote water\u00a0conservation systems,\u00a0I\u00a0look forward in due course to receiving\u00a0the advice\u00a0of An F&oacute;ram Uisce in relation to\u00a0further\u00a0practical steps that may be taken\u00a0in response to the recommendations of the\u00a0Joint Oireachtas Committee's Report.  This forms part of the work programme of An F&oacute;ram. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The issue of a rating system is just one element of promoting water conservation. Reflecting the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2017 and, in line with the Report of\u00a0the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the Water Services Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important\u00a0element of water services policy that is reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water. For the period of the Policy Statement, this involves the prioritisation of multifaceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to fix customer side leaks. The National Leakage Reduction Programme\u00a0in particular includes investment of\u00a0some &euro;250 million\u00a0over the next four years under the\u00a0Find and Fix repair scheme and the Water Mains Rehabilitation programme.<\/p>  <p>  Legislative provision to discourage the excessive use of water services was included in the Water Services Act 2017. Excessive usage is determined by reference to the threshold amount of 213,000 litres per household per annum as specified by ministerial order with effect from 1 January 2018, in line with provisions contained in sections 8 and 9 of the Water Services Act 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water is responsible for developing and implementing the necessary administrative arrangements, including billing arrangements, subject to oversight and approval by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that in July\u00a0 2019,\u00a0the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) announced its final determination, following a comprehensive public consultation process, on the new excessive usage charges and charging arrangements that will apply to domestic households deemed to be using water services excessively i.e. using water services above\u00a0the annual threshold allowance\u00a0of 213,000 litres per household.\u00a0The charges and charging arrangements now in place are consistent with the comprehensive\u00a0overview set out\u00a0in my\u00a0letter of\u00a015 July 2019 to the Joint\u00a0Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The overall aim is to encourage water conservation rather than to generate revenue.\u00a0 On this basis, I understand that Irish Water will work proactively with relevant customers to identify whatever practical steps may be necessary in order to address their situation and bring their consumption back within the threshold level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Additional allowance amounts for water usage will be available to larger households (where the number of residents exceeds four) and exemptions will be\u00a0available in cases of\u00a0medical need.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Report\u00a0of the Joint Oireachtas Committee recommended a proactive approach to promoting awareness of water conservation, and Irish Water places a strong emphasis on this important area. A dedicated section on the Irish Water website provides information in relation to water conservation at www.water.ie\/bewatersmart. The content includes suggested lifestyle changes to save water and information on how to check for water leaks in the home.\u00a0Information is also available on water saving devices outside of the home, including rainwater butts and rainwater reuse for the farming sector. <\/p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s website also has a facility where members of the public can report leaks in public areas. Based on the information provided, Irish Water will follow up to confirm a leak on the public mains and complete a repair. <\/p>  <p>  Irish Water also supports a number of environmental education campaigns which raise awareness, promote understanding and encourage people to take action on water conservation issues. This includes the Green Schools Programme, which has delivered savings of 360 million litres of water in schools in one year alone. Irish Water has also engaged with primary and secondary schools as part of Engineers Ireland&rsquo;s Engineers Week, to increase knowledge and awareness of water conservation and its benefits to the environment. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Irish Water has\u00a0undertaken\u00a0a research study to provide an in-depth understanding of household water usage.\u00a0\u00a0The findings, which show that, in general, people agree with the need to value and conserve water, will help guide the roll out of product and behavioural interventions to improve water conservation in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000058#WRL06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Protection Agency Funding","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000058#WRL06200"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[41552\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000058#WRL06300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the measures he has taken to review the research budget of the EPA on water management and conservation in line with the recommendations by the Oireachtas Committee on the Funding of Domestic Water Services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":773,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as\u00a0environmental regulator, is responsible for\u00a0setting quality standards and enforcing compliance with EU Directives and national regulations for drinking water supplies and wastewater discharges to water bodies.
