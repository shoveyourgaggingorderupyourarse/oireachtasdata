DFI is about making Ireland a fairer place for people with disabilities.  We work to create an Ireland where everyone can thrive and where everyone is equally valued.  We do this by supporting people with disabilities and strengthening the disability movement.  One key thing that we will always say is that disability is a societal issue.  DFI works with Government across all social and economic strands and interests of society.<\/p> <p>  There are executive summaries of both submissions but I will highlight a couple of points.  I refer to the unanimous ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the D&aacute;il in early 2018, along with the commitment in this new programme for Government to establish a joint Oireachtas committee to assist in monitoring and implementing the provisions of the convention.<\/p><p>The first of these, the ratification, simply commits Ireland to getting on with the work of implementation.  The second is critical and it is important for members to understand that it is a unique instrument.  Maybe there is one somewhere, but I do not know of any other parliament, certainly in the EU, that has such an instrument available to it.  The UN special rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities recently stated that every state's recovery plan must have improvement and protection of the lives of people with disabilities stitched into it and must ensure that people with disabilities can have a life, rather than just being cocooned or put in a parking space while we deal with Covid-19.<\/p><p> Services and supports for people with disabilities were in a bad state before Covid-19 struck.  Despite the full recovery of the economy, the capacity to provide services and supports was going in the wrong direction before Covid-19.  Poverty was decreasing generally but remained very high among people with disabilities.  Services were already facing deficits of more than &euro;40 million, and this year's HSE service plan included a 1% cut which was described as an efficiency measure.  All of that was before Covid-19.  The funding crisis has been exacerbated.  Organisations have faced huge losses in fundraising and earned income due to Covid-19.  Many organisations rely on fundraising.  If the cost of delivering services, including additional costs caused by Covid-19, is not fully funded, people with disabilities and their families will continue to bear them as services will be unable to survive.  <\/p><p> The demographic trend is going against us.  The most potent example of that this week was the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's findings on dependency ratios.  People are living longer, including people with disabilities.  Since Covid-19 there have been cuts to services such as personal assistants, schools, day programmes, etc.  Therapies and procedures have been stopped.  The supports and incomes of people with disabilities, which were always minimal and often precarious, have become intolerably so in the last four months.  Families who were always under too much pressure, as members all know, cannot see how they can continue.  As society reopens, we must consider a range of issues facing people with disabilities.  Support is required to allow those who are medically vulnerable to continue to cocoon.  This includes people with a range of conditions such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and many others.  As workplaces reopen, those individuals are no longer entitled to the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  The advice of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is that they should access illness benefit but many will not qualify as they are able to work and were in work.  People who are categorised as high-risk if they contract Covid-19 must be economically supported in continuing to follow the public health advice.  <\/p><p> We also need to reflect on what we have learned so far and be prepared for a second wave of Covid-19.  The lockdown took a heavy toll on the mental and physical health of people with disabilities and their family carers.  Resilience will not be as high if services are withdrawn.  We must also plan to ensure that essential services such as respite, home support and personal assistance are delivered safely.  We cannot just cocoon and isolate people.  They must be helped to get on with their lives.  The fundamentals of the economy are strong.  Our capacity to borrow is not in doubt.  We must invest now to minimise the damage to the lives and prospects of people with disabilities or two things will happen - people's lives and life years will be diminished and any later investment will only show modest returns.<\/p><p> While health and social protection are critical areas, the same is true for the work of other Departments.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides the agreed objectives.  That was accepted unanimously by the D&aacute;il and the Government in the previous term.  Its implementation must be at the heart of Ireland's Covid-19 recovery plan.<\/p><p>In this regard it would be very useful for the committee to invite the Minister with responsibility for disability to appear before it to explain how the Government intends to stitch the lives and futures of people with disabilities and their families into Ireland's national recovery plan from Covid.<\/p><p> I offer my thanks and appreciation to my colleagues, Dr. Joanne McCarthy and Ms Riona Morris, who did all the legwork. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Egan to make his opening remarks and I ask him also to confine them to five minutes.

Our submission is broadly based on a recent survey we carried out on the closure of day services and the impact on people with intellectual disabilities and their families.  Before I get into that, I wish to point out that Inclusion Ireland is the national organisation representing 66,000 people in Ireland with an intellectual disability and their families.  We work on the basis of a human rights platform and we use the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as the axis on which we work.<\/p> <p>  A number of key points for consideration arise from our survey.  Some 54% of respondents felt they had little or no contact from their service provider during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Regarding the direct impact on people, mental health was the key issue that emerged from the survey, with 38% of families saying they had seen a change in the behaviour of their loved one with an intellectual disability.  This behaviour could manifest itself in many ways from an anger outburst to the person retracting.  Some 33% of people felt that anxiety had become a major issue for them, and they were far more anxious.  Unfortunately, and sadly, 56% of people with an intellectual disability felt that loneliness had become a significant issue for them and felt loneliness was impacting on how they felt and on their general health.<\/p> <p>  On mental health, it is very important that the new Government policy, Share the Vision, is fully implemented for people with disabilities across the disability spectrum and that they have equal access to such services in their community at their doorstep.  This access also involves ensuring adequate communication protocols are in place for people with sight impairment, hearing impairment and speech impairment.  It is important that, as stated in Share the Vision, speech and language therapists become a core part of the teams operating at local level.  That is very important from an intellectual disability point of view.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the reopening of services, as the previous speaker pointed out, families at this point are at the absolute edge of their ability to cope with what has transpired during the Covid pandemic period thus far.  People are emotionally, mentally and physically at the end of their capacity to cope.  I feel another pandemic is about to hit us, which is family carer burnout.  That will lead to a revolving door of emergency cases.  From speaking to some people, there is evidence of this happening as we speak.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the HSE issued new guidelines in respect of the reopening of services.  We have concerns about some of those guidelines.  The key point here is that service providers must move as quickly as possible to reopen services.  They must do their absolute utmost and not use the guidelines as a stumbling block for the reopening of services.<\/p><p>In the survey, families indicated that some service providers had done very well and some service providers could have done better with the level of resources they have.  The reopening of day services is paramount.<\/p><p> Another issue directly related to the Covid-19 pandemic is congregated settings.  Based on figures from the beginning of this year, 1,953 people living in congregated settings are not there by choice.  It is extremely important that we learn from what has happened during the Covid pandemic.  Observance of the rights of people with intellectual disabilities living in congregated settings leaves a lot to be desired.  They do not witness the full implementation of human rights.  As the previous speaker stated, members have an opportunity to bring the Minister before this committee.  There are four Ministers with a brief in the area of disability issues.  All four should be brought before the committee to give their views on how they will ensure disability issues do not fall off the radar across the programme for Government.  While there are good elements in the programme for Government, we need to ensure they are front-loaded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Egan to conclude to allow us to hear from other contributors and ensure everyone gets some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#E00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I invite Dr. Conaty, acting chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, to make his introductory remarks.

The establishment of this committee was a specific recommendation of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to ensure proper democratic oversight of decision-making during the pandemic.  It is with particular respect to this work that we address the committee today.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is Ireland's independent, national human rights institution and national equality body.  It was established as a statutory body in 2014 and is accountable directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission is also the independent monitoring mechanism designated for Ireland under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We are supported in that work by a disability advisory committee composed of a diverse group of people with lived experience of disability.<\/p> <p>  In addressing the committee today the commission is conscious of our mandate to protect and promote human rights and equality in Ireland in what are truly exceptional times.  We are also conscious of members' role as legislators and public representatives to do the same.  The committee has heard and will hear from other witnesses today about the direct experiences of people with disabilities during the pandemic and the impact on services and the users of services.  We will reiterate aspects that are highlighted by them.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission emphasises for the committee that the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on people with disabilities should be understood in the context of the rights of people with disabilities and the actions taken or not taken to protect and realise those rights.  Under the UNCRPD, to which Ireland and the European Union are party, the State has an obligation to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to respect their inherent dignity.  This legal obligation is in addition to the fundamental principle of non-discrimination, including on the basis of disability outlined in Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the EU's equal treatment directives.  Article 15 of the Council of Europe's European Social Charter, to which Ireland is a party, guarantees the right of persons with disabilities to independence, social integration and participation in the life of the community.  The right to equality is also set out under Article 41 of the Constitution, as well as in statute under the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that Covid-19 has given rise to significant risks of discrimination and the undermining of rights of persons with disabilities, including the rights of older persons, many of whom have disabilities.  While Covid-19 is a once in a generation public health crisis, its impact should be seen in the continuum of how people with disabilities continue to be treated in the design and delivery of public policy.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 response has exposed inadequacies of Ireland's public policy for people who live in congregated settings, including nursing homes.  This includes disruption of supports in services for people with disabilities and for family carers; accessibility of information for people with disabilities; lack of appropriate data that would allow for more responsive decision-making; education and employment for persons with disabilities; and the noted absence of people with disabilities in decision-making that affects them.  These issues are detailed in our written submission and we are happy to discuss them further and at length with the committee.<\/p><p> I will highlight one example where it is critical that the human rights and equality implications of public policy are given full consideration.  In March, April and May of this year, the Department of Health published guidelines for decision makers in the health service and how access to critical care should be prioritised during the pandemic in the event that demand exceeds availability.  The commission has reviewed this guidance and is concerned that there are potentially profound implications for the human rights and equality of people with disabilities, older people and other vulnerable people.  We are concerned that those most likely to be impacted by this policy guidance have not been adequately consulted.  A consultation process needs to meaningfully consider the human rights and equality obligations of the State and the individual and collective rights of all of our citizens.  As a commission, we have communicated our concerns to the Minister for Health.  It is our view that the current moment, when the threat of Covid-19 has thankfully receded, represents an opportunity to further consider and develop this important guidance for healthcare workers.<\/p><p> More generally, with regard to the lived experience of people with disabilities, it is important to recognise the progress that has been made.  This progress has seen Ireland move from an old charitable medical model of support for people with disabilities towards a rights-based perspective, supporting people to live inclusive, independent lives.  It is a fact that the significant gaps and vulnerabilities in existing policy and services have resulted in a disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people with disabilities.  This disproportionate impact is at odds with the sentiment and message of collective solidarity in the face of the pandemic.  Unless the law, practice and policy which underpin the rights of people with disabilities are made more resilient, we will continue to see people with disabilities face the same vulnerabilities relating to their rights at times of crisis, including times of economic crisis.<\/p><p> The path to that greater resilience has already been mapped out, as noted by Mr. John Dolan and Mr. Enda Egan, and includes policy and legislation already identified as being needed to bring Ireland into compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  To this end, the commission also would add that the implementation of the public sector human rights and equality duty by public bodies and the exercise of their functions would be a significant and positive step towards permanently embedding the rights of people with disabilities in service delivery.  It is imperative that we learn the lessons of this crisis and that policy makers ensure that human rights and equality considerations are central in the review and development of policy, the impacts of which are deeply experienced by people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frank Conaty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Conaty.

Only last week, I raised the roadmap for reopening services with the Minister.  I am glad that those guidelines have been published and we are looking at a date in August, which is welcome.  However, serious issues still face those services.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Dolan back to these Houses.  I commend him on the work he did on disability when he was a Member of the Seanad.

He thinks it will be reversed but he might elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Egan referred to the roadmap and the carer burnout.

A sum of &euro;40 million in accumulated deficits across a number of disability organisations was reported to the Joint Committee on Health last year, prior to the crisis.  At the start of this year, we were flabbergasted to find that another 1%, or &euro;20 million, was to be taken out of the budget as an efficiency measure.  Representatives of the DFI met the then Minister for Health on 20 May last and he indicated quite clearly that the cut was not going to be triggered or operated this year, that it would not be possible to do so.  The then Minister asked us for a number of days' grace before we would say anything about it in public.  We subsequently wrote to the then Minister on at least two occasions and have still not received a clear response, in black and white, to state simply that the Department is confirming that the proposed cut has been removed.  That is where that matter stands and anything that members of the committee can do to get clarity on it would be a great support.

Where there were outbreaks, the average number of people involved in those outbreaks in disability services was six, in comparison to 20 in nursing homes.<\/p> <p>  That leads to the serious issue we cannot remain complacent about, namely, a second wave of Covid-19.  The wider issue has already been debated here this morning.  If one looks back to 2012, the Government introduced a policy and report, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings: A Strategy for Community Inclusion.  At that point, approximately 3,900 people were living in congregated settings, according to figures from the HSE.

Some of these are adult children and day care services for them have been suspended since March.  Many of them have not had any supports for four months, as our witnesses have outlined to us.  They have informed us that there have been cases of anger outbursts, of people being withdrawn or frustrated and  a lack of routine.  An indication has been given that the services may return in August.  That is very vague.  Has the DFI or Inclusion Ireland been given a date for the return of full services and are they confident that a budget to meet the costs of providing the full services will be available?  Costs should not compromise the service.  A full service is required.  Parents are very much in the dark about this, which is adding to their stress.  Many of them have ended up being ill and under medication as well, which is not what we want to see.

It must be noted that the HSE document states very clearly at the outset that there are going to be reduced to supports for people.  This obviously has a knock-on effect on family members who may be trying to get back to work or whatever the case may be.  The family member with a disability will not receive a full quantum of service.  This is very clear in the HSE documentation.

As the committee knows, we have been on this issue for almost a decade.  We welcome the commitment made in this regard in the programme for Government.  As a matter of urgency, we will look to establish real pathways so that people have other options besides needing to go into nursing homes.  We had been looking for a specific measure to be put in place and we are awaiting an announcement from the Ombudsman, who is about to make a ruling on this issue.  We are hoping that will provide further evidence of the need to put in place a package of payments and supports in order that people have other options.<\/p> <p>  All of this comes back to the fact that 80% of the money in disability services funds about 30,000 people with disabilities.  We are not saying that is a problem but simply showing that this figure illustrates the lack of investment in community-based services, especially personal assistance and home supports.  They are the vital services that are needed in the community to support people who are out of nursing homes.  They are also the services that are needed to support the resilience of families.<\/p> <p>  This pandemic has shown that the HSE, like all of us, when faced with a crisis back in February, put in a place a plan that prioritised what services families or individuals needed and then directed those services to them.  As we moved through the past six months of the pandemic, many families and individuals who were not at risk presented as not being able to sustain the level of care or supports that were required independent or outside of services.  We are talking here about the personal assistance and home support services.  When we made a plan for Covid-19, we planned for residential care settings.  We did not plan for community-based services.  The responsibility and onus then fell on individuals and families and we are feeling the impact of that now.  Rare Diseases Ireland did a survey of its members, almost 70% of whom spoke of the mental health impact of Covid-19.  The reason was the additional level of responsibility and stress, as well as the caring needs that have been required.<\/p> <p>  To support Mr. O'Connor's point, we also know of at least 400 families who provide full care to ageing people with intellectual disabilities.  Those providing that care are aged over 80.  There are real pressure points.  We have a lull, as our colleagues from IHREC noted.  This is a moment in which we need to reflect on where these pressure points are.  We have residential supports in place and we can begin to strengthen them.  However, we do not have as clear a pathway to providing community-based supports such as personal assistance home supports and the outreach supports for day services that will be required to sustain families and individuals if we have another surge of Covid-19.  These are important questions that merit being put under the spotlight so that we feel confident and families and individuals can be confident that services will be there for them in the community should a second wave occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Do I have some time left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#J00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Deputy only has 20 seconds remaining.

Many of the neurological organisations would provide peer and family support services.  These are very skilled people who come in and out of families at the onset of the neurological condition and travel through that family's life to the pathway of the condition.  They are able to provide expert knowledge and support.  If we take, for example, motor neurone disease, they might have a family nurse who works with them.  They know the trajectory of that condition from diagnosis to, unfortunately, the end point and then on to supporting families out the other side.  It is those sort of services.  I will use motor neurone disease as an example.  We know there are approximately 400 families at any one time in Ireland who are affected by motor neurone disease.  It is a ravaging condition that moves very fast.  For most people, from diagnosis to end of life is about four years.  That organisation works with that family to make sure they have access to the appropriate aids and appliances, information around self-help for the carer, and information around a good quality of life for the person at the different stages.  They would have a nurse and also, if I remember rightly, a family support, and they would also provide peer support.  All of those services went online very quickly as best they could but in many cases, and Inclusion Ireland will probably talk about this also, some services can only be delivered face-to-face.  All those face-to-face or person-to-person services were withdrawn.  While efforts were made to put online services in place, they could not fully replace face-to-face services at any one time.  In the lockdown, we were unable to get aids and appliances out to families if a condition changed dramatically very quickly.  I am sure they were not able to get aids and appliances to those families.  It is that level of community infrastructure that is often not fully appreciated by those outside our sector.  We do have day and residential services, and the core service programmes, but it is the softer community services that support the resilience of families and individuals to live with a level of independence in the community that are important.  Many of those got lost or had to go online and therefore may not have had the same immediacy as might have been required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>That is exactly the reason I asked the question.<\/p><p>It can be very difficult for outsiders who are not living with a condition or going through that as a family to really understand the importance of the supports that are being provided.

I will put a few things on record first and ask one question afterwards.<\/p> <p>  The word people with disabilities and their families have used to me since the pandemic struck is that they feel abandoned by the services, particularly people who were using the day centres or adult services.  Prior to the pandemic there was a huge crisis.  That will be multiplied now in terms of accessing speech and language and other therapies and, indeed, trying to find out whether people want assessment of needs.<\/p> <p>  This morning's meeting is welcome and we need to have a serious discussion on how people with disabilities are affected by Covid-19.  We have seen across all the sectors, quite rightly, initiatives such as the July stimulus, which is welcome, but we really need to look at how people are affected.  Regarding the roadmap for reopening day services and residential services, and there is a sense that while there is a roadmap and there is talk about August, it now looks like it could be September, is there real engagement with the Government and the HSE with these service providers to give them guidance?<\/p> <p>  In respect of a service provider in my area, St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, and the transport issue there, some service users travel 30 to 40 miles from four counties to come to the services in Charleville.  That provider has been looking at the transport issue, but what will be the resolution to that?  Many families with adults with intellectual disabilities cannot or do not have the wherewithal to provide that transport because the parents are elderly or because they are otherwise not in a position to do so.  What will be the solution to the transport issue?  Some service users are looking at alternatives.  What kind of funding is available for that?<\/p> <p>  Is there a real sense of urgency that families have been abandoned, especially as we move on in months in the pandemic?  The carer support groups within those families are meeting and trying to help each other.  I have heard stories from some service providers who have been giving hour-long respite for families so that parents can do simple things like take a shower and so forth, because there are people in their care with profound disabilities.  They have been the unheard voice in the calamity that has followed the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  This morning's meeting is welcome and further engagement must take place.  We need to get all the Departments and Ministers in before this committee to ensure all families get a sense that we as a Parliament and this Covid committee are taking on board their concerns and responsibilities as they go forward to make sure everything possible is done to alleviate the crisis for families.<\/p> <p>  The words \"breaking point\" have been used a number of times already this morning. Families are at breaking point and they are really looking for some sense of hope, some sense that we understand their plight and some hope and guidance about when the day, residential and shared care services will resume.<\/p><p>What is the guidance on the shared care services?  When will they resume?  There is a sense from the service providers that they are engaging somewhat slowly with the HSE, and the HSE is engaging with the Department, but there is no sense of urgency about it.<\/p><p> Could all Ministers involved come before the committee to deal with these urgent matters?  My final question is for Ms McCarthy but all the witnesses might comment on it.  Is there an urgency to the HSE's engagement with the service providers at the moment to try to make the best service available to service users and their families through the restoration of  adult services, day services, respite services and residential units that have been closed due to the pandemic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#M00300","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I might make a few comments on that question, and others may want to come in as well.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned people feeling abandoned.  Post-Covid was not the first time he or his colleagues heard people talk about feeling abandoned by the State and by public services.  It has ratcheted up hugely since the pandemic but things have been in a difficult space for a long number of years and we have not figured out a way.  It goes back to a point made by Mr. Conaty about getting the numbers.  The numbers are going against us.  Babies are being born today who would not have seen the light of day ten years ago.  There are more complex needs.  People are generally living longer.  People with disabilities are, thankfully, living longer.  Our demographic trends are going against us.  That is the frustration that policymakers have sometimes when they think they are putting in more money, but they are not putting in enough of that additional money for the greater need that is there.  The feeling of abandonment is certainly being very much heightened.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is about lack of ambition.  It is not good enough that people with disabilities do not die from Covid.  It is absolutely magnificent that there has not been the kind of attrition we have seen in other areas on that matter for people with disabilities.  However, the ambition cannot be that people's lives go into a freezer during the Covid period and we think that is okay; it is not okay.

For six to eight weeks, we have been looking for NPHET to give clearer guidance on this.<\/p> <p>  It was stated that people can apply for illness benefit but these people are not sick, they are trying to prevent themselves from being sick.  It would also mean a drop of approximately &euro;145 per week for that person.  As we know, people with disabilities have the highest at risk of poverty rate within the population.  They cannot really afford to take this risk.  It is very important that the committee considers this in order to figure out what measures need to be put in place, starting with income and then supports.  The other issue is extending the right to work from home where possible so employers are brought on board to support families in being able to make more appropriate decisions.  These are two of the main issues on which we have been seeking clear guidance from NPHET on behalf of families and people who are medically vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I will pick up on Deputy Carroll MacNeill's point regarding data because I was going to ask similar questions.

In fact, there was an earlier question about the challenge of reopening services that we did not get a chance to discuss.  When the onset happened initially there was a redeployment of staff from day services to residential services.  I presume they were backfilling the 24-7 care that was required in residential services.  There is a problem now because people in those residential services will not be resuming full day services.  Those day service staff are still supporting the residential services so how does one release those redeployed people back into supporting the reopening of day services?  There is an issue there because the same staff cannot be double jobbing.  They cannot be bilocated.<\/p> <p>  There is also an ongoing issue that must be understood.  We are moving away, and rightly so, from the concept of day services whereby one goes into a building, one stays there from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then one is picked up and brought home.  It is much more person centred.  People have individual work plans.  Some of them might be working two days a week in the local coffee shop or they might be going to an education and training board and doing some type of further education course.  Day services are very different now from the traditional sense, and should increasingly become more different.  However, none of those places is open now.  People who would normally be using mainstream community-based services, which is the right answer, are now looking to come back into - it is almost a regression - old models of service.  This is at a time when we must abide by NPHET guidelines regarding the number who can be in at a single time.  How fit for purpose are these buildings which we are trying to empty and which now are filling back up again?  It is a complex issue both for the services that are trying to reopen and the families and individuals who are really stretched and need an answer fast.<\/p> <p>  I know from our representatives and the representatives of other colleagues that these live debates are happening.  They are taking place at micro or CHO level where each service provider is engaging, and should be in deep engagement, with its CHO to figure out how it will reopen the service and what level of service can be reopened.  At national level there are efforts to try to give an overarching framework to support that delivery.  They are live issues, but we are dealing with very specific challenges within the system.<\/p> <p>  Finally, and it is awful and vulgar, there is a cost implication.  It is going to cost more to deliver the very same level of service, not to mind to expand or respond to the day services and the new additional services that will have to be introduced over the next year.  We are told that the services have to deliver within budget.<\/p><p>There is additional pandemic-related support for PPE and services; there is not for the fact that it will cost more to deliver even the same level of service.  I think there is a realisation that, as crude as the return to the concept of cost is, we have to take it seriously if we are really serious about resolving this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McCarthy for her comprehensive answer.<\/p> <p>  In the interest of time, I will finish on a comment.

It also showed the incredible resolve and dedication of people with disabilities, their families and volunteers and workers in sports organisations.  We know this is a particularly challenging time for people with disabilities and additional health complications.  The absence of services for months, the erosion of independence and ongoing uncertainty all take their toll.  One of the key lessons is that the State must do more to support our disability sector.  It is clear to me from conversations with people who have contacted me and service providers in west Cork, such as Cope Foundation and CoAction, that each story underlines the essential work that is carried out by families, communities and organisations in the area.  The State abdicates responsibility for this sector, relying on voluntary organisations and families to provide essential services, and I agree with all the witnesses that this has to change.  Each of their submissions highlights the challenges for the sector and individuals concerned and provides guidance on disability inclusive recovery.  I wish to focus my questions on this area.<\/p> <p>  Several of the statements refer to Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which guarantees the right to live independently in the community rather than in institutions.  Mr. Egan and Mr. O'Connor rightly call on the Government to make funding available to the HSE to move the remaining people in congregated settings to homes in the community.

A policy has been in place for almost nine years to move people out.  It saddens me to say that up to this point people in these settings have had as good a chance of passing away in a congregated setting as being moved out to a community setting.  What we do know, however, and what comes up in HIQA's annual reports, and we have done some research ourselves, as has the National Disability Authority, is that people's lives improve significantly when they move to smaller, community-based settings in line with their own wishes and desires, living in their own homes, such as all of us here do, being supported to do the ordinary things one does in one's own home and accessing community services.  Even HIQA's annual report from this year states that people lead lives that are not in line with human rights and that in larger residential settings there are issues in protecting people, safeguarding and human rights issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I wish to emphasise and support what Mr. O'Connor said, but the issue of decongregation has been a persistent and ongoing difficulty for the State for decades, and we have not solved it.

I will point out just one risk to human rights that will persist if we continue to have people in congregated settings.  Since 11 March, people have been in residential settings that have been essentially shut down, and these people have been confined to home without access to family.  We might say the position is similar for elderly people cocooning.  Many of these people nevertheless need access to family as their immediate advocates.  That access has not been available.

At normal times, it would be accurate to say these people's work is significantly undervalued by the State and it saves the State an estimated &euro;10 billion a year.

Some people with intellectual disabilities need consistency in their daily routine and their friends and support workers from within the day services have been taken away from them as a result of the closure of the services.  That has brought about a range of different behaviours that families have not seen previously.  That, in turn, has put huge pressure on families, many of whom are trying to work from home or provide care for other family members and other siblings in the home environment.  This has brought about huge issues for people trying to home educate, as the environment within the home is completely different from that in the school.  Many families are experiencing complete physical, mental and emotional burnout from trying to juggle all these issues that Covid has brought about.  As Deputies have highlighted, the real concern for people is that they cannot see an end to this.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel.  For example, we dealt with somebody yesterday whose sibling was getting a service for one hour a week.  They have been told that will go up to two hours a week from 8 August.  There is no pathway for how that is going to increase, as has been said repeatedly this morning.  The pathway document with guidelines on the resumption of day services issued by the HSE last week clearly states that while there is a Covid-19 emergency, services are not going to return to pre-Covid levels.<\/p><p>There is no indication as to what levels can be achieved.  We all know that we will be living with this situation for some time.  There will have to be a national movement of people with intellectual disabilities, everybody with a disability and family carers to ensure that the Government is aware of the pressures those people are under.  The Covid-19 pandemic is obviously having an impact on the abilities and rights of people to go out and march and bring their views to the streets.  I would not like to see that situation taken advantage of as a result of people not being able to do that. <\/p><p> What needs to happen is that services need to open up very quickly.  As has been outlined, some organisations and service providers have done well.  Others may have appeared to have used the pandemic as a reason to not provide a service and perhaps to take a very risk-averse view regarding Covid-19.  From here on, however, the HSE at national level is adamant that services need to reopen quickly.  At the local level of the CHOs, there needs to be clear engagement with service providers because these services have to be got up and running very quickly.   <\/p><p> There are issues here, however, as has been stated, regarding providing some funding to maximise capacity and also to take advantage of the situation to put in place the kind of services and methodology in service provision that has been underpinned by the policy, New Directions, which was introduced in 2012 with a four-year plan.  There are still major gaps regarding how that plan has been implemented, but there are opportunities now for service providers to implement that New Directions plan properly and to ensure that the person with the disability is right at the centre of the service being provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Egan and Deputy Paul Murphy.

We have asked and, as far as I know, there is still no plan to address the restoration of pay for that part of the section 39 organisations.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is dead right.  That means that often the organisations deliver very similar or matched or the same model of services through section 39, but those organisations are not able to match the pay of section 38 organisations, which are essentially funded through the public purse and are on the public sector payscales.  The brain drain, therefore, continues to happen.  A physiotherapist might be working in one organisation and then a vacancy comes up with a section 38 organisation.  That person will apply for that post and then leave, because he or she will be doing the same job but for more money in the new job up the road.  That whole level of inequity is one of the issues that we know exists.  <\/p> <p>  These are the fundamental issues that are continuing to destabilise services in the disability area.  Those issues are also one of the key things identified in the review undertaken by Catherine Day.  The independent review group had been established, just before Covid-19 struck.

One person said he got absolutely no respite and no day care since the service closed in March.  This has had a tremendous impact of all concerned.  His parents are managing him 24-7.  The care was given over to them and there was no respite or home support.  The carers were totally exhausted with never a minute off.  There was no time for other family members who also needed support.  There was continuous striving to maintain calmness.<\/p><p>It is of vital importance that the Minister for Health makes temporary funding available to ensure that as many people get supported with the greatest amount of time possible upon reopening the services.  When the lockdown came I saw that people who had carers coming to their houses had their hours reduced from eight to six, to four, to two.  I have seen carers who wanted to go to work told by the caring services they only had a half an hour or an hour to provide the services.

I sat with John in the Seanad for four years.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about preschool children.  They are not expected to social distance and I believe they can go in groups, like pods.  I am concerned that the HSE has reduced disability funding to organisations by 1%, which on the scale of things is massive.  Will there be funding for these preschools when they go back?  Is that a concern?  <\/p> <p>  The second matter on which I received several phone calls is that children have not been receiving any therapies - physiotherapy, occupational therapy, OT, speech, psychology - as the HSE is now only operating face-to-face with priority 1 cases.  Already, we have had long waiting lists, particularly for network disability team, NDT, autism spectrum disorder, ASD, assessments, with no new appointments being given.  This is worrying for the families. <\/p> <p>  The early intervention service is simply not happening for many as by the time their turn comes around for assessment, therapy or speech or OT, early years have passed.

In fairness, we need to know when all the services are opening.  Given that Ms Comerford is from Kilkenny, I am sure Deputy Funchion will raise it too.  We need a roadmap.  When I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the other day, I asked her when we could get official dates.  We have heard a suggestion that it might happen in August or September.  The Minister of State told me she had been speaking to the HSE.  She has asked about a web page because she believes it might give more information about the over 1,000 services provided to adults.  I feel from dealing with families and listening to their concerns that there is a lack of information.  What do the witnesses feel about the new web page that is to be put up by the HSE?  Can I have an answer on that?<\/p><p> The other thing I want to ask about is whether there will be enough funding.

The really good thing about the vulnerable subcommittee is that the community Covid response was also sitting and reporting in to that committee.

Within disability and within the HSE we committed to responding and putting in place as best we could an initial emergency response to the pandemic.  Any issues that we as a sector felt we could not get resolved we had the capacity to escalate to NPHET.  Having fewer than 16 people with disabilities in residential services pass away as a result of Covid - which was still 16 too many - does speak volumes when one looks at the difference between what happened with us and within nursing homes.  It was partially because we had that link.<br\/><br\/>There are some outstanding issues, the decisions around the wearing of face masks is definitely a problem for the deaf and hard of hearing.  That is an ongoing issue that we have with NPHET.

PA hours were cut, home helps have not been coming in and, as was clarified earlier, there are no dates for the resumption of some services.  It may not be until December or January.  This was already a sector so overburdened with waiting lists.  From the point of view of children who are dependent on various therapies, so many of them have regressed.  That is why it is important that there would have been a link.  It is not necessarily a decision for DFI and we can bring it up with the Department later, but this group has been abandoned.<\/p> <p>  On masks, a number of people have contacted me over the last few days since that announcement was made, particularly about people with autism or sensory issues.

One has a 25 year old daughter who is severely disabled and completely dependent for everything.  The mother writes that it is very hard on her body to look after her.  Her back is in absolute agony from the physical demand.  She is emotionally drained and down in herself at all times.  Other parents have more than one child with a disability.

We are in no doubt about the challenges facing the disability sector as it seeks to come to terms with the Covid-19 era.  Many of the witnesses have eloquently emphasised that those challenges existed before Covid-19.  I am particularly concerned about the funding challenge and the timeline for a return to full day care services.  We got the roadmap last week and there was some indication of a possible return of services in August.  I am concerned by the overtures from the witnesses today to the effect that it could be as late as December or possibly the new year before we see any real meaningful service in that area.<\/p> <p>  We have several service providers in Longford, including the Phoenix Centre, the National Learning Network and St. Christopher's Services, with which I know Mr. Dolan is very familiar.  He came there and spoke at the annual general meeting several years ago.  I note 12 of the St. Christopher's Services day care staff members were redeployed to provide cover at residential settings during the Covid-19 pandemic.  In order for St. Christopher's Services to expand its day care service to families who are genuinely and badly in need of it, it will have to bring those 12 staff members back from deployment in residential service.  The catch, unfortunately, is that those in residential care cannot be left alone.<\/p> <p>  This comes down to the sums.  The annual cost of replacing those 12 staff members will be just under &euro;580,000.  If a day care service resumes without additional funding it will be patchy at best and certainly significantly inferior to the service available at St. Christopher's Services before the onset of Covid-19.  We have seen &euro;70 million ring-fenced for the childcare sector.  It was much needed and it is very welcome.

If that requires a temporary Covid-19 fund, so be it.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  That envisages people being involved in their everyday communities.  There is a HSE policy on this, New Directions.  That should give people choice around education, employment and making progress in their lives.  It has not been fully implemented.  If any new funding is available it should be channelled in the ways called for by New Directions.  That does not necessarily mean people having to go to a big centre somewhere.  As Dr. McCarthy said earlier, a lot of people work a couple of days a week.  They can be supported to go from their homes to their places of employment.  If they are accessing an education course in the community, they can be helped to do that from their homes.  This does not always have to involve travelling to a big centre.

We wish to start by formally recording our appreciating for healthcare workers, support staff and anyone working involved in the delivery of healthcare during the pandemic which includes our own staff at the Irish Cancer Society.  Their selflessness allowed for the ongoing provision of urgent cancer services in even the exponential phase of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This included the Irish Cancer Society's night nursing team who provided nursing care in the home of patients who were at the end of their lives.<\/p><p>Our national support line was extended to seven days a week to assist with increased queries from anxious patients and family members.  Our volunteer drivers continue to provide transport to people right across the country enabling patients to get to life-saving chemotherapy treatment.<\/p><p> Regarding the impact of Covid on cancer services, a few key points need to be addressed.  On 27 March all non-essential surgery, screening and diagnostic procedures were postponed causing huge additional anxiety for patients.  The impact of these postponements on cancer outcomes will take years to be fully uncovered.  The immediate impact is that it has led to thousands of people not being screened, as well as growing waiting lists for cancer tests and treatment.  There is little clarity in sight as to how these will be addressed.  It is evident that without immediate action there will be excess and avoidable cancer deaths in the years to come as a result of people getting the care they need later than they should.  An illustration of this is that we would expect approximately 450 cancers and 1,600 pre-cancers to have been detected in a typical four-month period if the screening services had been operating as normal.  As such, we are very pleased that CervicalCheck has now resumed but disappointed that BowelScreen and BreastCheck may not return until autumn.  In addition to screening we are concerned that there are still symptomatic patients who have not sought medical advice and as a result may experience a delayed diagnosis and access to treatment.  If action is taken immediately then we might avoid the most dire predictions becoming a reality.  Some of these are included in the submission we made to the committee.<\/p><p> As a first step the HSE must publish a recovery roadmap without delay and the Government needs to fully fund this before budget 2021.  The crisis in cancer care pre-existed Covid-19 and the pandemic has just made things worse.  Before Covid, targets in the national cancer strategy relating to timely access to diagnostics, surgery, radiotherapy, and the uptake of screening were all being missed.  This is a direct consequence of consistent underfunding of a system that has been running to stand still in recent years and which has frequently budgeted in the knowledge that it will not meet demand.  As such a return to normal is in fact undesirable for us.  We want and need to do so much better.  All of us - Government, Oireachtas Members, advocacy organisations and healthcare workers need to ensure that cancer services are fully restored in the short term.  We need to take the opportunity to build back a better cancer system focused on the full delivery of the national cancer strategy.  Rather than using a challenging environment as a reason not to improve services, we need to use it as the precise reason for building better, more equitable, high quality care that addresses the many needs of cancer patients in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#FF00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Morrogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Morrogh.<\/p> <p>  I invite Ms. Clyne to make her opening remarks and ask that she also confine them to five minutes to allow for questions and answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#GG00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Good afternoon.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.<\/p> <p>  The IMO is the trade union and representative body for all doctors in Ireland who are delivering care to patients across the health services.  This includes consultants, public health doctors, community health doctors, GPs and non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  The fundamental problem within our health services is one of capacity and this predates Covid.  As a country, we have restricted patient care to match the deficits of our services rather than investing in those services to meet patient need.  The Health Service Capacity Report was published in 2018 but little or no progress has been made since.  Covid has resulted in extreme pressures on our health services.  Our response should not be to limit all other care, but to proactively increase capacity to allow for non-Covid care pathways and create capacity for any Covid surge.  To do otherwise will only compound the problem.  It is inevitable that patients whose care has been delayed will present with more complex needs as they deteriorate and they will suffer negative health outcomes.  Mortality rates will increase.  We now have a situation where capacity will be reduced by up to 50% while at the same time there are more than 800,000 people waiting for an outpatient appointment or inpatient care.<\/p> <p>  We have mounting pressures on our emergency departments throughout the country.  Extremely limited referral pathways are available to GPs and there are increased pressures on GP services in situations when patients cannot access secondary care, diagnostics mental health services and other community supports.<\/p><p>There is severe overcrowding in our emergency departments with patients languishing on trolleys, elective procedures are routinely cancelled, there are lengthening waiting lists and hospitals are operating at dangerous levels of occupancy.  Unfortunately, this year will be worse with the additional impact of Covid-19.<\/p><p> In summary, we have too few beds and we need to plan for an additional 5,000 public acute beds and 300 additional ICU beds.  In this context, we must immediately embark on a temporary build programme in tandem with longer-term builds.  We have more than 500 vacant consultant posts, and for many years the system has not been capable of attracting sufficient numbers of consultants due to inequitable pay policies.  General practice and the much needed shift of care to the community must be planned and resourced.  There is little additional capacity in general practice at the moment.  We must strengthen our public health capacity.  We have relied on public health throughout this crisis, but public health is understaffed and undervalued within our system.  Care of the vulnerable and elderly in our society requires urgent attention with significantly more resources deployed to allow people to remain at home.  We need to continue to invest in prevention with appropriate resourcing of our vaccination programmes and significant investment in diagnostics and treatment pathways to support our screening programmes, and those screening programmes should open as soon as practicably possible.  We also need to invest in e-health across all hospitals and community healthcare settings.<\/p><p> Since the commencement of the pandemic, doctors and all other healthcare workers have shown dedication to patients, professionalism and agility in adopting new ways of working.  We now appeal to the members of the committee and the new Government to respond in kind to support us and our patients by investing immediately.  This is a health crisis and we must respond accordingly and prioritise investment in our health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Clyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Morrogh and Ms Clyne.

Ms Morrogh referred to this in her opening statement when she said that thousands of people had not been screened, that it may take years before we know the full extent of what this will mean for patients, and that some patients may die prematurely if we do not put in place the catch up and if people do not get a diagnosis as quickly as they should.

We know the environment is extremely challenging but consider the figures calculated by the Irish Cancer Society.  Some 450 cancers have possibly been undetected to date and additional pre-cancers have been undetected.  One can start to understand that without our screening programmes Ireland is missing a central plank in its cancer prevention and early detection strategies.  If we do not restore the screening programmes to the high quality screening systems that were place before Covid-19 then we risk the general public's health and the chances they have of being diagnosed with cancer early.  We know the importance of an early cancer diagnosis.  If a person is diagnosed at an early stage then his or her chances of survival are so much better.  Ireland is not doing well in cancer survival.  Ireland is lower than the OECD average and we need to do much better.

There is a cancer detection rate within that group.  There are currently 19,000 people waiting for a colonoscopy.  How are the endoscopy services able to do more, since there is a backlog, with less, due to the capacity issue?

There was already huge pressure and massive unmet need within the system at a time, before Covid-19, when we were running our acute hospitals at between 97% and 104% occupancy.  The public is aware of this because members of the public are waiting for procedures.  They are also aware of the fact because of the level of crowding in emergency departments.

I am regularly hearing GPs complain about a lack of access to diagnostic services.  Is there any way that we can fast-track and improve that service immediately?  People are being referred to outpatient clinics that duplicate a lot of the work that GPs are already doing, but GPs have to refer patients because they cannot get access to diagnostic systems.  How can an improvement in that regard be fast-tracked?<\/p><p>Since December 2014, the number of people working in the HSE has increased by 20,000.  The figure has increased from 103,000 to 123,000 whole-time equivalent staff.  If we were to prioritise recruitment in the morning, which areas should be prioritised?  When consultants are recruited they also need to have access to beds, operating time and support staff.  Where should the priorities be for staff recruitment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#KK00600","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I will answer some of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions and pass others on to my colleagues.<\/p> <p>  The idea of prioritising has been the fundamental problem.  We have to accept that our health services do not have enough doctors, nurses and other health professionals working in them.  We have to accept that we do not have enough beds.  This idea of robbing Peter to pay Paul and making a choice between a consultant and a nurse will not improve the lot of patients.  We need significant financing of our health services and we must take this opportunity, as our colleagues in the Irish Cancer Society said.  We do not want to go back to the way it was before Covid-19 when it was not good.  We want to move on and go back to a system that meets patients' needs and allows people to work in a system and deliver the care they are trained to deliver, rather than running around everywhere trying to source a diagnostic for patients.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of diagnostics in general practice, I have been looking at budgets from various Governments for many years that show an allocation for diagnostics for general practice, but this budget has yet to materialise.  I understand representatives of the HSE who appear before the committee this afternoon will say the HSE is bringing diagnostics to general practice.  We would very much welcome that.  We would also welcome sitting down with the HSE to see how that will be run.  If GPs had quicker access, we would prevent some people from being referred to hospital.  People will still need to use hospital services so these services cannot be limited by virtue of capacity.  We have to think outside the box and ask how, if this is the limit, we will improve capacity, not just operate within capacity.<\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Dr. McCauley, who is the chair of the general practice committee and a GP in County Donegal, to talk about the diagnostic flow through from the GP to the secondary care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Clyne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Burke for his question.

What we in the IMO would like to see, and what every doctor in the country would like to see, is an actual plan to invest in the capacity requirements of the system.  Essentially, 5,000 beds would look like a 500-bed hospital.  My concern is that, to my knowledge, no plan as yet has been put in place with regard to capital expenditure, despite a 2018 document advising us that significant investment needed to take place.  We need the planners, the engineers and the architects of the country to address the requirements to provide that capacity, but we need 5,000 beds.  With those beds we also need specialists in the acute hospital system.  We need approximately 1,600 more specialists in the system just to bring us close to the OECD specialist<i>per capita<\/i>average.  Without those, we cannot provide the timely care that our patients need in a safe way.<br\/><br\/>Modular builds now are significantly better than they were when I was in school where one could put one's pencil through the walls of the prefabs.

Currently, it is quite complex to do business plans and get funding through.  All of that has to be speeded up.  Medics, clinicians and their nursing and other colleagues can be innovative and can put forward proposals for funding to get that through.

Some patients are sitting on chairs.  There is no social distance and staff are exposed.  The INMO has asked for an internal investigation into full controls for nurses to reduce the risk of spreading infection.  Looking at hospitals across the country we see that some of them are struggling with the pandemic and some are not.  Perhaps it is time to start examining the management system in some of the hospitals that are not being managed properly.  The front-line staff deserve to be protected, but so do the patients.  Why is it the case that in certain situations some hospitals are running well and some are not?  We must look at how we can assist in this from a structural point of view and at the reason that certain hospitals are coming under that regime.  An additional 96 beds were allocated, but staffing at the hospital has depleted by 20%.  Is this not something we should examine from a management point of view?  This question is one I asked at a previous meeting of the committee in respect of the meat factories.  It is down to the fact that there are management problems in certain areas.  If there is no good management, there is no good structure.

We have not been in that space, but what Covid has shown us is that when the system pulls together it can achieve amazing things regarding the delivery of safer care.  Some 8,000 healthcare professionals in Ireland contracted Covid in the course of the delivery of care to patients, which is a significant number of people who became unwell as a result of the work they do.

General practice is always adaptable, innovative and flexible.  However, we need a plan and it needs to be resourced.  If care is being transferred just for the sake of it, without it being proven to be useful, that is a bad thing.  If it is being done just to save money without any view of the actual benefits, or lack thereof, to the patient, then that is a bad thing.  <\/p> <p>  If, however, certain parts of care can be transferred and if it has been clinically proven that GPs can at least match that care and, as a GP would say, at times even improve that care and if that is feasible and the resources are provided, then general practice will stand up.  If the transfer of such care is incoherent, however, and if it is not planned and resourced, it could actually have a detrimental effect.  The system is now in flux and the last thing we want is for that flux to result in a decision to transfer care to the community without all the personnel being in place in the primary care teams, as well as the GPs.  It is a laudable concept but it must be effective and it must be resourced.  <\/p> <p>  There was a talk earlier about the flu vaccine.  Any raised temperature that occurs in the community now will have an emotional and financial effect.  We will not know if a raised temperature is Covid-19 until we test people.  The flu is one aspect, however, where we can step up.  The previous Minister spoke of vaccinating children.  Once again, if that programme is planned properly, and we would like to get the planning done as quickly as possible so we can implement it, this will be a service that will show it can be effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#VV00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Denis McCauley"},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I referred to the short, medium and long-term plan because I have been associated with the health services for generations at this stage.<\/p><p>It is only in recent times that we heard of the lack of capacity of physical buildings and, obviously, the follow-on in staff.

I must make the point that for over a decade now the IMO has been highlighting the capacity deficits within the system.  This goes back to many previous Governments.  In 2008 capacity first began to be reduced.  Then it was severely impacted and reduced at the time of the financial crisis.  The IMO warned at that time of the negative impact that would have on future generations.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we need to do to attract staff into the system.  We need to value and respect them.  We need to listen to them and allow them to do their jobs in a well-resourced environment.  We cannot have two-tier pay systems for medics or doctors.  That is a disgrace.  The basic principle of equal work for equal pay holds.  Yet, we are asking doctors, who are being head-hunted from every part of the globe, to come and work here because we value them so much that we will pay them 30% less than the person they will be working beside.  Then we are surprised that they will not come and work here.  We are asking our non-consultant hospital doctors, who are currently being asked to work 24-hour or 26-hour shifts, to come back to this health service and work here while claiming that we value them and respect them.<\/p> <p>  We have an issue with the general practitioner population.  Up to 600 GPs are due to retire over the coming years.  Retirement is a major issue not only because of the normal issues of retirement but because of Covid-19.  Some of these GPs may be at a vulnerable age or have underling health conditions themselves.  Yet, we say to our newly-established GPs that we have no supports to help them and we will not help them to set up.  We tell them they are on their own.<\/p> <p>  Government must address the absolute fundamental basic inequalities in the system.  Government and the health service must value the staff they wish to recruit.  It is not enough to say \"thank you very much\" occasionally or in a pandemic.  That is welcome and it is good to be recognised, but that culture must continue.  There has to be a culture of respect, of paying people properly and of listening to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#WW00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Clyne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>One grouping which is important in the context of the pandemic is the public health doctors.

During the Covid-19 emergency these people have been working night and day, possibly to the detriment of their personal health.

Its representatives were concerned about the incapacity of the health services to deliver, alongside the continued combating of the virus, while at the same time providing for the extra surge and service requirements that will arise as we approach the winter.  They are concerned that the incapacities are at two levels, namely, in respect of buildings and ancillary facilities on the one hand and in respect of qualified staff on the other.  They also made reference the unattractiveness of work in the Irish health service at the present time, for a variety of reasons.<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear a response on that point first, if I may.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#MMM01100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>That is a real concern for us.<\/p><p>In some of the submissions we have made to the committee the Deputy will see we have identified that there is a challenge.  As the committee will be aware, what has happened over the last number of months is that we have seen a significant fall-off in attendance at hospitals.  We have seen that recover substantively in the emergency care and emergency flow areas.  We saw a significant fall-off in scheduled care.  We compensated to some extent in the private system for that three-month period.  We are entering into further arrangements with a view to extending that.  <\/p><p> The challenge identified is a correct one.  The Deputy mentioned facilities and there is a challenge there.  We are currently pulling together a lot of proposals to expand capacity physically.  That challenge is most apparent in areas like outpatients and emergency departments.  Some measures are already in place around that.  As part of our winter planning process, which has accelerated this year, we are identifying further requirements.  Indeed, the new Minister has instructed us to do so on an urgent basis.  From our point of view there is definitely a facilities challenge.<\/p><p> In terms of staffing, it is correct to say this whole pandemic experience and what it has meant to the health environment and to the wider public has been extremely difficult.  That has been the case for staff also.  It has really only been through the Herculean efforts of staff we have gotten to where we are.  Staff numbers within the overall health system in this period have risen by over 3,200.  There has been a significant increase but, of course, there has also been significant absence associated with Covid-19.  Growing that staff and growing key service areas, like intensive care, acute beds, community homecare and other supports, is a key priority for us.  They are all falling into being considered as part of our winter planning process.<\/p><p> I agree that the challenge will lie more in identifying issues.  Our task is to grapple with that and put in place the best arrangements we can now for what the Deputy rightly identifies will be both a potential return of Covid-19, depending upon the trend in the pandemic, and also the emergence of winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#MMM01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Have staff levels at consultant level been adequately replaced or replenished?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#NNN00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>The number of clinical staff and doctors employed has risen significantly.

We made the difficult decision to suspend screening because many of our women go up to the age of 69.  It is a very close contact examination so we suspended screening very reluctantly.  That was the right decision at that time.  We also had, at the time, approximately 500 women with screen-detected abnormalities so we set about doing that.  We are conscious that we have a lot of ground to make up.  It is the last thing in the world that I would want to do.  I have spent my whole professional life advocating screening and it is the last thing I would want to do.<\/p> <p>  If we screen 1,000 women, we will pick up seven cancers.  If we look after 1,000 women with specifically urgent symptoms we will pick up 100 cancers.  We had a situation where we did not have the ability to do everything.  The hospitals were being protected for the big surge.  It was a challenging time and there was a lot of fear.  I want to congratulate all our staff for helping us to deliver the service at all stages during this time.  We have been working to look after women with symptoms and that is the priority.  We must maximise our efforts.  We are in the middle of a pandemic.  Our ability to get back to screening normally is limited until we get to a situation where we do not need to have 2 m social distancing.  It is not that we do not want to, but that is the reality and we will do everything in our power.<\/p> <p>  There is, however, a whole area of work.  The European Society of Breast Imaging has given us guidelines on what to prioritise in the Covid-19 situation.  We have been following exactly that guideline and the lowest priority at the moment is screening healthy women.  We have women with a family history who have an 80% lifetime risk of breast cancer.  They are in the hospitals and we are screening them at the moment.  We are screening women with previous breast cancers.  They have a much higher incidence.  We are using our resources to the best of our ability in a very challenging environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#OOO00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Ann O'Doherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1594940400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>At the present time, it is suggested that considerable numbers of people are awaiting oncology results or tests and could be on a waiting list for some considerable time, which is obviously not a good place to be.

From our point of view we are going to market specifically for the purpose of acquiring private diagnostics to support GPs but also to look at the use of public facility.  We have recently looked at the access to diagnostics in public hospitals for GPs.  As the Deputy would be aware, nearly half of the laboratory work at the moment in public hospitals is in fact from GP referral source.  There is also access to radiology.  The key requirement, which in our own dialogues with GPs is very clear, is that the provision of additional diagnostics and of dialogue with consultants and with specialists, is a key ingredient to treating people at or closer to home and not in hospitals.

I welcome all our guests.  I want to concentrate my questions on the issue of the flu vaccine.  Earlier in our session here, and we are all only too well aware of it, there was discussion about the fact that, pre-Covid, we had a very severe shortage of hospital beds.  I think we are all aware of that from the capacity review.  That situation has been exacerbated greatly through Covid-19.  Obviously, there is the whole question of reserving 20% of bed capacity in the event of a second wave.  There are also severe constraints imposed as a result of the need for better infection control and distancing within hospitals, which reduces the bed capacity even further.<\/p><p>On top of that we are heading into the flu season.  There is now the prospect of a perfect storm developing in which our hospitals could be overwhelmed.  What is the situation in terms of preparation for the flu season?  Recently, I saw the figure for the number of people who were hospitalised last year due to the flu, which was 4,300.  That is significantly in excess of the total number of people who were hospitalised as a result of Covid-19.  There are real challenges facing us and a real prospect of the hospital services being overwhelmed.  What steps are being taken to improve the uptake of the flu vaccine to avoid a fairly severe situation arising in the hospitals?  The uptake last year and in previous years was not great.  What is the current estimate of the number of vaccines the HSE will have to procure?  Last year, I believe the figure was 1.2 million vaccines.  We should certainly hope to improve on that if we are to avoid serious problems in the hospitals.  What number is the HSE estimating for the demand and what number of vaccines has it ordered and is confident it has secured?<\/p><p> In addition, in recent days the EU Commission urged all member states to launch earlier and broader vaccination campaigns against the flu this year to reduce the risk of simultaneous flu and Covid-19 outbreaks in the autumn and to avoid what the Commission refers to as a cocktail of risks.

I believe there is capacity now in the public system to do increased scoping and radiology later in the afternoon or in the evening because of the capacity constraints during the day.  I wonder has the NTPF looked, as I stated earlier, at using some of the specialist registrars, SpRs, using some of the consultants on-site to try and expand hours into the evening.

I doubt there is a hospital manager in the country who has time to sit down and consider how the hospital is going to extend services and hours beyond what they are doing at present.  Surely it is the remit of the fund to acknowledge it has the purse and the ability to pull people together.  The fund should be prepared to implement plans in respect of vacant operating theatres, the availability of cleaning staff, whether there are surgical bed days and bed nights and whether it can provide capacity.

That is very much what happens.  This is very much a two-way street.  As with other sections in the health service, we now realise that we are going to have to find new and more innovative ways of working.  We are going to have to find ways to support patients in this new, changed environment.  They include measures such as virtual consultations, diagnostic services and clinical validation.  Several areas like these could extend the approach we have taken.  We are open to suggestions but we are not behind the door in making suggestions ourselves or in coming forward with ideas.  My colleague, the chief executive, is very much at the coalface and brought forward many such ideas long before Covid-19 appeared on our doors.

I am keen to highlight the situation that Deputy Cullinane alluded to earlier, which is the closure of a catheterization laboratory in Waterford since February.  This is adding between 30 and 50 diagnostic cases to the waiting list every week.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that essentially the engineers who are required to travel from abroad will not come into the country to observe a two-week isolation period.  If we gave them a Covid-19 test and they proved that they were covid-free, they could come in and do the work.  I have been asking the HSE in recent weeks to expedite this.  To date, nothing has happened.  It is not beyond the wit of man to have this done.  Will Mr. Woods give categoric approval to put in place Covid-19 testing, communicate with the squires of that laboratory, get these engineers in and get this cath lab up and running please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020071700002#YYY00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1594940400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>My understanding is that the project has recommenced.
