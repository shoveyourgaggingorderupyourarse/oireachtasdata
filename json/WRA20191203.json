This is addressed under Pillar 4 of the Government&rsquo;s Future Jobs Ireland strategy. Pillar 4 is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force as this will lead to the more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce.<\/p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland outlines a number of key ambitions and deliverables to help to increase participation in the labour force. A number of these ambitions are centred on flexible working solutions which can offer benefits for employers, employees and wider society in general. Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work-life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so. <\/p>  <p>  A deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working. My Department is currently leading on this research which focusses on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research will identify the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working. The research will also include an international policy review which will consider related policies abroad in order to understand the impacts of this on remote working.<\/p>  <p>  To assist this work, an Interdepartmental Steering Group has been formed with representatives from my Department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of An Taoiseach. This Group is providing guidance and feedback to the members of my Department who are leading on this report.<\/p>  <p>To date, the research has included desk research, quantitative research and important engagement with key stakeholders, including employer representative bodies and remote working interest groups. As part of the consultation process, my Department held a Remote Working Consultation Forum on July 18th   of this year in Cavan Digital Hub. This was attended by Government Departments, State Agencies, enterprises, and the remote working community. This insights arising from this event will be included in the final report.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this, my Department launched a national Remote Working Employee Survey in October to capture the prevalence and types of remote work that employees are engaging in across regions and sectors. The results of the analysis of the survey will provide data on the range of influencing factors for employees and employers.<\/p>  <p>  The insights arising from the various strands of research will be included in a cohesive final report which will outline the key implications for remote working in Ireland. Based on the report&rsquo;s findings, which will be published soon, consideration will be given as to the appropriate next steps to be undertaken by Government on this matter.\u00a0The Department of Justice and Equality will also be launching a consultation on work\/life balance shortly which will identify further areas of consideration for flexible working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Injuries Commission","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[49932\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the progress of the implementation of the recommendations of the Personal Injuries Commission that are relevant to her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) was established in 2017.

In addition, unemployment rate fell by 11% in the same period bringing the number of unemployed people to 128,000.<\/p>  <p>  At the heart of national competitiveness is the ability of Irish businesses to compete successfully in international markets. Two of the most important determinants of competitiveness are productivity and costs. A competitive economy is one where productivity is not out of line with the cost base. <\/p>  <p>  As a small, highly open and concentrated economy, we are particularly vulnerable to external shocks and cannot afford to be complacent and must continuously strive for improvements in order to remain competitive . The increasingly challenging international environment raises the stakes even further.<\/p>  <p>  Over the medium to long term, productivity growth is the main mechanism to improve competitiveness as it can support cost competitiveness in tandem with high and increasing wage levels and improving living standards for all. <\/p>  <p>However, our strong competitiveness position cannot be taken for granted &ndash; especially because Ireland is a high cost economy (the 5th   most expensive in the EU). Improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position is a key priority for this Government, and my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland is a whole of Government framework designed to improve our economy&rsquo;s resilience in the face of emerging and future challenges.

Taken together, Climate Plan 2019, Project Ireland 2040, Global Ireland 2025 and the Future Jobs represent an integrated approach to prepare for the opportunities and challenge of the future economy.<\/p>  <p>  A range of specific deliverables in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 aim to enhance the business environment and improve competitiveness, as well as other factors, that contribute to specific sectorial cost challenges. Some examples include:<\/p>  <p>- On credit and financial costs  , the Future Growth Loan Scheme will provide long term debt financing for strategic investments at competitive rates in\u00a0a post-Brexit environment;<\/p>  <p>- On legal services  , new business models for legal services will be introduced, including new legal partnerships and limited liability partnerships;<\/p>  <p>- On construction  , an implementation plan for actions to stimulate construction sector productivity will be delivered, including greater deployment of Building Information Modelling.<\/p>  <p>  As a small open economy, we must never underestimate the importance of maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring that the cost of doing business does not impede this.\u00a0In this regard, Future Jobs Ireland is an integral component of the Government&rsquo;s over-arching plan for the future of the Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmaceutical Sector","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[46674\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if her Department has examined whether Ireland is approaching a patent cliff specifically in the pharmaceutical industry (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>The Budget 2020 Economic and Fiscal Outlook noted that Ireland&rsquo;s production base is highly concentrated in a small number of high-tech sectors. However, the overall macro-economic risk assessment matrix in Budget 2020 regarded the likelihood of risks relating to our concentrated production base as low.<\/p>  <p>  The pharmaceutical sector in Ireland operates within a broad national and European legislative framework. That legal regime means companies here benefit from a level of patent protection for medicinal products that is amongst the strongest in the world. Protection is afforded, for example, for original discoveries for a period of 20 years. In addition, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) grant protection for a maximum of five additional years following expiry of the initial patent. This is to account for the time period between patent filing and approval of medicinal products by medicines regulators. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of the patent cliff on the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland was the subject of a working paper produced by the Department of Finance in 2013. That paper addressed the expiry of specific patents and associated issues. My Department also continues to monitor and analyse trends in the pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors on an on-going basis, given the importance of those areas to our economy. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the pharmaceutical industry continues to perform well here. The global top ten biopharmaceutical companies all have a manufacturing presence in Ireland, as do many other firms. The sector employs approximately 30,000 people directly in IDA-supported companies. Along with high export figures and high-value employment, the sector also contributes strongly to the Irish economy in many other ways, such as investments in research and development and through sub-supply contracts for goods and services. We also have many highly innovative indigenous firms that are continuing to grow. <\/p>  <p>  It is the case as well that Ireland continues to win new investments in the areas of small and large molecule manufacture and cell and gene therapies.

The Deputy will be aware that policy responsibility for these functions lies with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government (as regards the planning process) and with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment (for the EPA) respectively.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2018, the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Policy&rsquo; was published by my Department, following consultation across Government, including with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment. The Statement sets out clearly that the\u00a0existing demand\u00a0for\u00a0data centre development poses opportunities and challenges for Ireland, and that a planned approach to addressing these is required. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that data centres present challenges given that they are very energy intensive, and in the Dublin region in particular, there are\u00a0grid infrastructure\u00a0capacity constraints. Eirgrid have made clear that there will need to be limitations on connecting large new demands.\u00a0However, data centres are also important to ensuring that Ireland continues to be a leader in the digital economy. The Government Statement\u00a0sets out how we will\u00a0strike a balance between the challenges and opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  To address\u00a0the subject of carbon emissions, while I cannot verify the projection raised in the Deputy's question, I would highlight that\u00a0many of the large data centre operators in Ireland have made public commitments to using 100% renewable\u00a0electricity as soon as practicable. Further, as Ireland increases the level of renewable energy on our electricity grid towards the 70% target set out in the Climate Action Plan, all electricity powered operations will by definition become more carbon efficient. I am also aware that a number of data centre operators in Ireland have chosen to sign 'Corporate Power Purchase Agreements' to buy electricity directly from renewable electricity generators. I believe that\u00a0a\u00a0more sophisticated 'Corporate Power Purchase Agreements' market in Ireland could act as a catalyst for investment in renewable electricity generation by large data centre operators and\u00a0officials\u00a0in my\u00a0Department and in IDA Ireland\u00a0are working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, as well as the SEAI,\u00a0to enable that to happen. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government Statement highlights that IDA Ireland has increased its emphasis on promoting a range of regional options for data centre investment. They have\u00a0identified specific sites in regions throughout Ireland that are potentially suitable for accommodating the sustainable development of large scale data centre projects in terms of proximity to necessary energy and other appropriate infrastructures, subject to the required planning and environmental oversight. IDA Ireland only facilitate investment in projects that are deemed likely to deliver real regional economic benefits - and do not provide any financial supports for data centres in the Dublin region. <\/p>  <p>  While the number of people directly employed in data centres may be relatively small, the fact is there are over 120,000 employed in the\u00a0ICT sector.  Data centre presence in Ireland raises our visibility internationally as a technology-rich, innovative economy, which, in turn, places Ireland on the map as a location of choice for a broad range of sectors and activities that are increasingly reliant on digital capabilities including manufacturing, animation, retail, medical devices and financial services &ndash; for both Irish- and foreign-owned enterprises. They also facilitate many other activities across the economy, enabling e-payments, securities transactions, banking, fraud protection, cloud telephony, inbound, streaming, video and outbound IP traffic. The storage, processing and analysis of data is a rapidly growing business sector in its own right, and is the equivalent for digital goods, of factories for physical products. Data centres securely store and manage the data which keeps much of our information-based economy and society moving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Site Visits","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[49709\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the most recent occasion on which IDA Ireland visited counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath; the number of new jobs created by IDA Ireland in the past 12 months; the steps it is taking to attract companies to the counties; the success it has had with the strategy for the counties; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>Increasing the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) in regional Ireland &ndash; including in the Border region &ndash; has been a priority of mine since I was first appointed as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.

That&rsquo;s why I am committed to achieving the best possible spread of FDI across the country and to working with our enterprise agencies to generate employment and investment outside of our main cities.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Monaghan experienced an 8% increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) employment, with 12 jobs added by companies in the County.\u00a0Similarly, Meath saw a 4.5% increase, with the creation of 67 new jobs. While there were\u00a0no new\u00a0FDI-supported\u00a0jobs created in Cavan in 2018, it is encouraging\u00a0to note the announcement by Liberty Insurance in October that\u00a0it will\u00a0create 120 new roles in the County over the next three years.

It is encouraging to note that there have been four IDA site visits to Monaghan as of Q3 2019 compared\u00a0to three site visits for the entirety of 2018. \u00a0We've already seen\u00a0a threefold increase in site visits to Cavan with six visits to the County as of the third quarter of 2019 compared to two visits in 2018. While the IDA will continue to promote and showcase locations in these Counties to prospective investors, it is important to remember that the decision as to where to invest is always taken by the companies themselves. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the IDA have taken a number of steps to attract further investment to Monaghan, Cavan and Meath.\u00a0The next phase of the IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP), for example,\u00a0 includes\u00a0plans for\u00a0an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU)\u00a0at Knockaconny, County Monaghan.

Future Jobs Ireland points to increasing participation in the labour force as a key pillar in ensuring that we are prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the economy and workforce of the future.\u00a0 As the nature of work and society changes, the way we organise work will also change. Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, remote working, compressed hours, home-working and job sharing.\u00a0 These options can result in a win-win for employers, workers and society as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently facilitating debate and consideration of one of these flexible working options, through its research into the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce, the attitudes towards such working arrangements, as well as the factors which inhibit employers and employees to partake in such arrangements.

Commercial Policy (CCP).\u00a0 The Lisbon Treaty extended this competence to cover foreign direct investment, as well as making the European Parliament a co-legislator alongside the Council on trade matters.\u00a0 Under this architecture the European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries regarding trade agreements with non-EU countries. \u00a0Member States (in Council) approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are consulted as the negotiations proceed and have final approval at Council as has the European Parliament.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The current international trade environment has seen a rise of protectionism, which is an unwelcome development for Ireland, given our open and globalised economy and has the potential to harm market sentiment and disrupt global supply chains should the situation prolong and\/or escalate.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Co-operation on trade matters is in all of our common interest and Ireland very much welcomed the Joint US-EU Statement following the meeting between President Trump and then Commission President Juncker in July 2018.\u00a0 The Presidents agreed to work towards zero tariffs, non-tariff barriers and subsidies on &ldquo;non-auto industrial goods&rdquo;, to work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans.\u00a0 They also agreed to strengthen strategic energy cooperation, to launch a close dialogue on standards to ease trade barriers (regulatory cooperation), and to work closely together with like-minded partners on a reform agenda for the WTO.\u00a0 They also committed to resolving the steel and aluminium tariff issues and to introduce no further tariff measures unless either party terminated the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  On the 10th September 2018, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m and U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer initiated the work of the

Trump.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On 15th April 2019 the EU Council voted to approve the negotiating directives for the commencement of limited trade negotiations with the US in the sectors of conformity assessment and the removal of tariffs on industrial goods. \u00a0The Joint Statement\u00a0also referred to seeking an agreement on &ldquo;non-auto industrial goods&rdquo;.\u00a0 As it is important that negotiations focus on a limited range of areas where results could be realistically achieved quickly and without entering areas of significant sensitivity for either sided,\u00a0Public Procurement from the US perspective and Agriculture from the EU side were excluded.<\/p>  <p>  Technical discussions regarding talks on conformity assessment for the testing and approval of certain products are taking place and progress is being made.\u00a0 I am hopeful that formal negotiations in this area may not be too far away as the EU Commission has\u00a0submitted a draft Agreement in this area to the US side.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>Additionally, on 17 May 2019 President Trump announced via Presidential Proclamation that he had delayed by 6 months the imposition of tariffs on automotive and automotive parts imports from the EU to allow US trade officials to attempt to negotiate a solution to what the US sees as a matter of national security, albeit from the EU side we\u00a0do accept this rationale.\u00a0 The proclamation provided a 180-day time frame for the negotiation of an\u00a0agreement. \u00a0This deadline has now passed without any formal announcement from the US.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Separately, as far back as\u00a06 October 2004 the United States requested consultations, in line with WTO procedures, with the governments of Germany, France, the UK\u00a0and Spain, and with the European Commission concerning measures affecting trade in large civil aircraft. \u00a0The US concern was that Airbus were receiving subsidies from these Member States supporting\u00a0the production of its civilian aircraft and that these subsidies were damaging to a direct competitor, US aircraft manufacturing firm Boeing, and contrary to WTO rules.\u00a0 In parallel, on 27 June 2005, the EU made its own request to the WTO for consultations citing Boeing&rsquo;s receipt of non-WTO-compliant subsidies from both federal and state level authorities in the US.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 May 2018 the WTO Appellate Body found in favour of the US\/Boeing - that Airbus were receiving non-compliant subsidies from certain EU Member States.\u00a0 Subsequently, a WTO arbitrator evaluated the claim and reported on the 2 October 2019 that the value of countermeasures that the US can impose commensurate with the adverse effects caused by EU subsidies is $7.496 billion. \u00a0In the parallel Boeing case, the WTO arbitrator&rsquo;s report is due for finalisation and publication\u00a0around\u00a0Q2 2020.<\/p>  <p>  On the same day as the WTO Arbitrators' Findings were released, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) published its final list of products that will be targeted with new tariffs. \u00a0The list has 15 sub-sections with Ireland, along with other EU Member States, included in 9 of these sub-sections. \u00a0For those products effected by the USTR list, Ireland exported approximately &euro;362m worth of goods to the US in 2018.\u00a0 My Department continues to engage with industry to fully understand the potential impacts these measures will have. \u00a0We are also fully engaged with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and our Enterprise Agencies in relation to implications for Irish business.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government has highlighted our concerns in bilateral engagements with US interlocuters in Dublin and Washington, intensively over recent months. \u00a0The issue of the tariffs was also raised during the US Presidential and Vice-Presidential visits this year.\u00a0 I and my officials, as well as colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, continue in contact with our US counterparts in Dublin and Washington on these issues. \u00a0In addition to raising this matter with my fellow Trade Ministers in Council, I have also recently written to the United States Trade Representative to outline the impact these measures will have on Irish exporters.\u00a0 I also held a bilateral meeting with Trade Commissioner-elect Phil Hogan while in Brussels in October at which we discussed the WTO Airbus and Boeing cases and the potential impact the imposition of tariffs on Ireland would have.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to a negotiated settlement to this issue as I firmly believe imposition of\u00a0tariffs will only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.<\/p>  <p>On another EU-US trade issue, on\u00a014 June 2019   the Commission informed Member States that it had reached an agreement in principle with the United States and other substantial supplying countries regarding the &ldquo;Hilton&rdquo; Beef quota.\u00a0 The agreement does not change the overall volume, quality or safety of beef imported into the EU; rather\u00a0it allocates a larger share of the quota (35,000 Tonnes out of a total of 45,000 Tonnes) to the United States, phased in over a period of 7 years.\u00a0 The quota was an interim solution put in place some years ago to address a long-standing dispute between the EU and the US regarding the EU&rsquo;s ban on the importation of hormone beef into the EU.\u00a0 The European Parliament voted in favour of this Agreement on 28th November which will hopefully see its adoption by Council in early December and an entry into force\u00a0from 1st January 2020.\u00a0 This is a positive example of what can be agreed by the EU and US working together.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Set against the current\u00a0EU-US trade turbulence,\u00a0and also having regard to the impacts of Brexit, my Department through Enterprise Ireland supports Irish based companies in their ambition to internationalise and diversify their export base or global footprint. \u00a0This is critical for long term business growth. \u00a0In 2018 Enterprise Ireland:<\/p>  <p>  - Supported clients in winning 1,504 new overseas contracts<\/p>  <p>  - Supported clients establish 402 new overseas presences<\/p>  <p>  - Supported 82 first time exporters outside the UK<\/p>  <p>

market entry strategies in new geographic markets. \u00a0This fund provides support towards internal and external costs incurred when researching new markets for products and services.\u00a0 Support for Market Discovery Fund applies when eligible companies are either looking at a new geographic market for an existing product\/service or an existing geographic market for a new product\/service. \u00a0The Market Discovery Fund is available across three levels involving grants up to &euro;35K,\u00a0grants between\u00a0&euro;35K but less than &euro;75K and grants greater than &euro;75K but less than &euro;150K.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must emphasise that the Economic Trade and Investment Relationship between Ireland and the United States has been immensely beneficial to both countries, and Ireland remains fully committed to a continued strong partnership with the US &ndash; both bilaterally and at EU-level.\u00a0 It is important to appreciate that the European Commission has &ldquo;competence&rdquo; on International Trade matters on behalf of the all EU Member States and in this regard,\u00a0I welcome the progress made on the Joint US-EU Statement agenda to date, albeit, from an Irish perspective we wish swifter progress could have been made in our ongoing dialogue.\u00a0 I remain optimistic that we will see a return to more usual trade relations between the EU and US that would be in both of our mutual interests, and in the meantime, Government, principally through Enterprise Ireland, has a range of enterprise supports to assist companies diversify their export base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":55,"content":"<p>Question

Department\u00a0along with\u00a0the enterprise agencies are deeply engaged in the enterprise development agenda in the Midlands. The importance of this enterprise development work has been brought into sharp focus in the context of the particular vulnerability, and the opportunities, presented by the transition from &lsquo;brown to green&rsquo; in this region.<\/p>  <p>  The Midlands was hit relatively hard by the recession, which affected all regions, but like the rest of the country has made a very strong recovery. The unemployment rate in the Midlands currently stands at 6.1 percent (compared to the State average of 5.2 percent at end Q3 2019). This is a vast improvement on the position at the beginning of 2015 when unemployment stood at 14.9 percent. Since Q1 2015 23,300 jobs were created in the Midlands region.<\/p>  <p>  The IDA supports 42 client companies in the Midlands, employing 5,720 people. The region was the highest performing region from a job creation perspective across the IDA regional portfolio in 2018, with FDI employment growing by 13 percent or 701 net new jobs added. <\/p>  <p>  Over 12,300 people are employed in 247 Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the Midlands, which is up by 4 percent in 2018. LEO supported micro-enterprises added 271 net new jobs across the Midlands during 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Midlands faces a new challenge however, which will require renewed efforts to grow alternative sources of employment. The enterprise agencies, LEOs and other development bodies are fully engaged and are focused on leveraging the key strengths and potential areas of opportunity. My Department also has close engagement with the Department of the Taoiseach in relation to Just Transition and the Midlands.<\/p>  <p>  The Midlands Regional Enterprise Plan, which I launched earlier this year, and the\u00a0Steering Committee\u00a0in place to drive its implementation, has a key role to play. The Midlands Plan, which covers Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath, is one of nine &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; enterprise focused regional plans that\u00a0leverage collaborative regional action.<\/p>  <p>  The Midlands\u00a0Plan\u00a0sets out seven Strategic Objectives agreed by stakeholders as priority areas of focus and enterprise growth to 2020, spanning areas such as: transition to a low carbon economy; big data opportunities; advanced manufacturing; place-making and marketing; tourism; food; and skills development.<\/p>  <p>  Strategic Objective 1 of the Regional Enterprise Plan aims to &lsquo;ensure that the Midlands is well positioned to address the challenges posed by the transition to a low carbon economy and renewable energy&rsquo;. The Regional Enterprise Plan for the Midlands\u00a0 therefore\u00a0strongly aligned with and supportive of the work of the Regional Transition Team led by Offaly Co.

That is why\u00a0my Department and its Agencies have been\u00a0doing everything\u00a0we can to increase the level of employment and investment in every county in Ireland.\u00a0This\u00a0has included placing a particular emphasis on boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) in regional areas. <\/p>  <p>  We are making good progress in this regard. 2018 saw more jobs created in IDA client companies outside of Dublin than at any point in the last 17 years. Every region in the country saw FDI-driven job gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed in IDA client firms outside the capital, representing nearly 60% of all IDA-supported employment. It is important to\u00a0note this\u00a0represents the highest number of people employed in IDA-supported companies outside of Dublin in the history of the Agency. These statistics show that the investment the Government has made in promoting regional development is producing results and that job creation across Ireland continues to rise. <\/p>  <p>  As for Tipperary in particular, the IDA has been working to increase its stock of FDI in 2019, just as it has been trying to deliver further investment in every county in the country. Tipperary is already home to ten different IDA client firms, which collectively employ over 3,700 people. This client base includes well-known firms such as Abbott Ireland, Boston Scientific and Merck, Sharp and Dohme. Last year saw a net total of 55 new FDI jobs created in Tipperary. <\/p>  <p>  A key focus for the IDA in Tipperary in 2019 has been supporting further job growth in companies already present there. Experience, gained over decades of FDI in Ireland, shows us that overseas companies already in situ are the most likely to generate new employment opportunities. The IDA&rsquo;s staff work closely with client companies to explore the potential for further such job creation and they are currently doing that with client firms in Tipperary as well.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The IDA has a number of incentives in place to encourage companies to invest in County Tipperary. In addition to the general support that it provides to client firms through advice and expertise on investing in Ireland, the Agency\u00a0is authorised by\u00a0my Department\u00a0to provide a range of particular\u00a0financial supports in the form of employment, capital, research and development, environmental and training grants. These grants\u00a0represent\u00a0an important\u00a0means of encouraging companies to invest in Ireland, particularly in regional locations. In 2018, the IDA paid almost &euro;4.4m in grants to client companies based in Tipperary. <\/p>  <p>  Site visits are another\u00a0important tool in attracting prospective investors. As of the third quarter of this year there have been five IDA site visits to Tipperary. The Agency will continue to suggest suitable sites in the County to investors considering locating in that wider area.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to Brexit, our efforts to win more FDI will be helped by our continued status as an attractive destination for overseas firms. We have already seen over 70 Brexit-related investments and 5,000 associated jobs won since the outcome of the referendum in June 2016. Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union ensures that companies considering an investment here will gain barrier-free access to the EU market. When taken together with other\u00a0strengths - such as\u00a0our pro-enterprise environment and our highly-skilled dynamic workforce -\u00a0I am confident that Ireland will continue to be an attractive destination for mobile overseas investment in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Injury Claims","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC05400"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[50141\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300062#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the actions being taken regarding personal injury awards.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) assesses claims in line with the current level of damages.

The growth in demand for shopping online is driving the retail sector more broadly to develop its online capability in order to enhance its competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  To enable retailers to increase their customer base and build a more resilient business, I introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme in 2018 administered by Enterprise Ireland. The Scheme, with a fund of up to &euro;1.25m over two Calls, provided funding to 40 retailers across Ireland, with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50 percent match fund basis. Eligible expenditure under the Scheme included activities required to strategically enhance retailer's online offering, and included:\u00a0research, strategy development, implementation and relevant training. The Pilot Online Retail Scheme\u00a0concluded this year we will review its effectiveness.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the LEOs undertake a number of activities to encourage businesses to build their online presence and compete online. The Trading Online Voucher Scheme administered by the LEOs and funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, is designed to help micro businesses trade online to boost their sales and reach new markets. The Scheme is a matched-funding opportunity with up to &euro;2,500 available, with training provided by Local Enterprise Offices. Funding can be used towards eligible costs such as digital marketing strategies, e-commerce websites or app development. <\/p>  <p>  LEO Measure 2 supports including training in digital marketing, management development, Lean4Micro, Productivity Voucher and mentoring are available to all sectors including retailers. <\/p>  <p>  I recently announced the successful projects under the\u00a0LEO Competitive Fund. One project - the eCommerce Cluster project has a primary objective to support and educate online retailers in the North-East.

The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), including LEOs in Cork, are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. In addition to offering support and guidance, the LEOs act to signpost businesses to appropriate supports. They also participate in and run events related to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs in Cork have run 14 Brexit-related events to date. These include Brexit Advice Clinics on 9 and 29 October, which facilitated discussions of concerns businesses have about Brexit and the effects it may have. On 18 October, a &ldquo;Take the mystery out of Brexit&rdquo; event was also run in Cork, which offered a practical information session explaining key Brexit-related issues and identifying common risks to Irish businesses and how best to deal with them. Further events are planned for December, including a Currency Risk Management workshop, as well as more general business advice events.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer Brexit-specific mentoring to businesses. Up to the 22nd of November, 1,221 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Of these, 77 were from Cork. <\/p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short-term working capital, for terms of up to three years, to eligible businesses to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. As of 25 November, there have been 898 eligibility applications received, of which 810 have been approved and 214 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;46.68 million. The most recent quarterly report indicates that businesses in County Cork account for 9% of eligibility applications. <\/p>  <p>  As the operators of the Scheme, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) have been actively promoting the Brexit Loan Scheme (BLS) and Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS). Officials from the SBCI attend numerous business-related events to inform and promote schemes. Promotional radio campaigns have been run at national and local level together with a digital campaign which included Twitter and LinkedIn.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Officials from the SBCI have also attended accountant workshops to promote the scheme and make this cohort of advisers aware of it. These officials have also been present at Brexit-related events around the country to promote the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a dedicated Brexit page on its website which includes information on the schemes available. Officials have put together Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme information packs which are available through my Department&rsquo;s the website.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has also published a report detailing the supports available to indigenous enterprises, including Brexit supports such as the Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme.

The Brexit Loan Scheme provides a fund of up to &euro;300 million to businesses to facilitate innovation, change or adaptation in response to the impacts of Brexit. Already, 214 businesses have been approved for bank loans under the scheme, to a total value of &euro;46.68 million.

My Department and I are already working, as best we can,\u00a0to address the consequences for the employees and the Shannon region.<\/p>  <p>  Soon after learning of the intended closure, I spoke directly with the CEO of the company and made it clear that the Irish Government very much regretted the firm&rsquo;s decision. Unfortunately, as he explained, the decision was irreversible.<\/p>  <p>  I also travelled to Shannon, together with Minister of State Breen, to convene a meeting of key stakeholders. This included representatives from the State&rsquo;s principal enterprise agencies, Government Departments, Clare County Council, Third Level institutions and the local business community. Our collective focus was to determine how best to respond and to assist those employees who would be impacted by the closure.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following that meeting, an action plan was agreed with Molex to support the skills development needs of its workers and to help them find alternative employment. Many of those impacted have valuable skills and experience and the IDA, together with other stakeholders, will be drawing the attention of potential employers to their availability. The IDA will also be working separately to market the facility to prospective investors and to find new investment for the area.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Looking further ahead, we will need &ndash; as was collectively agreed at the stakeholder meeting &ndash; to ensure we create new opportunities across the wider Mid-West region that can help offset many of these job losses. The Mid-West Regional Enterprise Plan &ndash; which I launched earlier this year &ndash; will be a critical tool in that respect. <\/p>  <p>  While the Molex closure undeniably represents a significant blow for Shannon and the wider area, it remains the case that the Mid-West is performing well in economic terms.

In the period 1st January to 31stOctober 2019, the WRC held 4,141 adjudication hearings. Under employment rights and industrial relations legislation, it is open to either party to appeal the decision of a WRC Adjudicator to the Labour Court.  The WRC&rsquo;s 2018 Annual Report indicates that approximately 10% of adjudication decisions are appealed annually to the Labour Court.  Equal Status decisions are appealable to the Circuit Court.  <\/p><p>In 2018, over 90% of complaints received by the WRC&rsquo;s Adjudication Service were processed from receipt of complaint to decision issuing within six months, where there were no requests for postponement and where submissions were received in a timely manner. In the period January to October 2019, the median time for decisions to issue from date of receipt of complaint is 8.2 months. Factors impacting processing times include postponements being sought, delays in the parties making submissions to the WRC or the parties may have attempted to mediate the dispute. The WRC intends, following consultation with stakeholders, to introduce a new pilot procedure for seeking postponements, which should impact positively on processing times. Another factor impacting processing times is the volume of complaints received by the WRC for adjudication. This year to end of October 2019, the WRC received a 44% increase in specific complaints in comparison to the same period last year.  <\/p><p>The WRC will continue to maintain and improve the level of quality service being delivered in 2020. Key objectives for the Commission next year include the reduction of the median time for processing adjudication complaints by an additional two weeks on 2019, ensuring a smooth transition of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to access the services of the WRC and the targeting of  more &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; employers and sectors by the Inspection and Enforcement Division. <\/p><p>In 2018 the Labour Court received a total of 1169 cases which include appeals of WRC Adjudication Officers decisions and industrial relations referrals. The Court scheduled 954 hearings and the average time for cases to reach hearing in 2018 was 12 weeks in respect of industrial relations cases and 19 weeks in respect of employment rights cases.  In 2019 to end October, the Labour Court received 865 appeals\/referrals and scheduled 902 hearings.  During that period, the average time for cases to reach hearing was 17 weeks in respect of industrial relations cases and 26 weeks in respect of employment rights cases. <\/p><p>Factors affecting these times include postponements being sought, delays by the parties making submissions to the Labour Court or are the consequence of the Labour Court&rsquo;s commitment to the formation of hearing programmes in the regions which involve appropriate workloads and as a result optimal value for money. A key factor affecting timelines for employment rights cases is that the process of bringing an Employment Equality and Unfair Dismissals case to hearing involves provision of time to make comprehensive written submissions before arrangements can be made to schedule a hearing.<\/p><p>The average time taken for the Court to issue its decisions\/recommendations following a hearing in 2018 was 2 weeks.  The Court issued 504 decisions\/recommendations in 2018.

There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst site visits are an important tool in helping showcase regional locations to investors, it is\u00a0important to remember\u00a0- as I have made clear before -\u00a0that the final decision as to where to invest rests solely\u00a0with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as\u00a0a significant proportion of\u00a0all new\u00a0FDI comes from existing IDA clients already present in the country. <\/p>  <p>  For commercial sensitivity\u00a0reasons, IDA Ireland can only make data available on site visits that have already\u00a0taken place.\u00a0Over the first three quarters of this year, County Kildare has hosted eight site visits. <\/p>  <p>  FDI levels in County Kildare are trending in the right direction. Kildare experienced a\u00a04.5% increase in IDA-supported employment in 2018, with the creation of 386 net new jobs. The enterprise agencies under my remit will continue\u00a0to engage with their clients and\u00a0with one another to secure further investment and job creation for Kildare and the Mid-East region in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300063#WRD05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Future Growth Loan Scheme","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300063#WRD05600"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[49966\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300063#WRD05700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of the drawdown under the future growth loan scheme; the way in which this scheme is benefitting small businesses; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes available a fund of up to &euro;300 million of loans available for terms of eight to ten years.

The US concern was that Airbus were receiving non-WTO compliant subsidies from these Member States regarding the production of its civilian aircraft and that these subsidies were damaging to a direct competitor, US aircraft manufacturing firm Boeing.  In parallel, on 27 June 2005, the EU made its own request to the WTO for consultations citing Boeing&rsquo;s receipt of non-compliant subsidies from both federal and state level authorities in the US.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 May 2018 the WTO Appellate Body found in favour of the US\/Boeing - that Airbus were receiving non-WTO-compliant subsidies from EU Member States.  Subsequently, a WTO arbitrator evaluated the claim and reported on 2 October 2019 that the value of countermeasures that the US can impose commensurate with the adverse effects caused by EU subsidies is $7.496 billion.  In the parallel Boeing case, the WTO arbitrator&rsquo;s report is due for finalisation and publication circa Q2 2020.<\/p>  <p>On the same day as the WTO Arbitrators' Findings were released, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) published its final list of products to be targeted with new tariffs.  The list has 15 sub-sections with Ireland, along with other EU Member States, included in 9 of these sub-sections.  The new tariffs were introduced by the US on 18th   October 2019 following the receipt of the procedurally- required \"authorisation\" from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DBS) on 14 October 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to impacts, latest CSO data shows that Ireland recorded goods exports to the US of approximately &euro;39.27 billion in 2018.  The US is Ireland&rsquo;s largest goods export market, accounting for 28% of total goods exports in 2018.  For the period January to June 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s total goods trade with the US was recorded as in the region of &euro;22.2 billion.  This was an increase of 14% of the same period in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  For those products that fall under the USTR list, Ireland exported approximately &euro;362m worth of goods to the US in 2018, with the principal exports being:<\/p>  <p>  liqueurs and cordials valued at &euro;168.5m,<\/p>  <p>  butter valued at &euro;156.8m and<\/p>  <p>  cheddar cheese valued at &euro;37.3m. <\/p>  <p>As of 18th   October 2019, exports of these products now attract an additional 25% tariff on entry into the US.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with industry and colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and our Enterprise Agencies in relation to the implications of these tariffs for Irish business.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties, the EU Commission takes the lead on this issue taking into account the views of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.  Therefore, Ireland continues to be engaged with the Commission, both at Ministerial and official levels on these issues.  My Department and I continue to engage through the relevant EU fora such as the EU Council of Trade Ministers and the Trade Policy Committee to articulate Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns on what is an EU-wide issue.  Furthermore, I also had a bilateral meeting with Trade Commissioner-elect Phil Hogan in October where we discussed the WTO Airbus and Boeing cases.  <\/p>  <p>  The removal of the additional US tariffs on Irish food products will likely require a negotiated resolution to the both the EU and US aircraft disputes.  To this end, the European Commission has made clear that it stands ready to work with the US to negotiate a fair and balanced solution for our respective aircraft industries.  I, my Ministerial colleagues and my officials have continuously expressed support for such a negotiated solution and our position remains that the mutual imposition of sanctions will only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.  <\/p>  <p>  As recently as this July, the EU shared concrete proposals with the US for a new regime on aircraft subsidies and a way forward on existing compliance obligations on both sides, to avoid any further escalation of tariffs.  So far, this has not led to a satisfactory outcome.  Nonetheless, Ireland&rsquo;s preference, as I and my Government colleagues as well as my officials have articulated, along with the EU, is for a negotiated settlement to be reached on these issues and we look forward to EU-US engagement to that end.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has highlighted our concerns in bilateral engagements with US interlocuters in Dublin and Washington, intensively over recent months.  The issue of the tariffs was also raised during the US Presidential and Vice-Presidential visits this year.  I and my officials, as well as colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, continue in contact with our US counterparts in Dublin and Washington on these issues.  In addition to raising this matter with my fellow Trade Ministers in Council, I have also recently written to my counterpart, United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer to underline Ireland&rsquo;s disappointment at the tariffs applied on Irish products.  I also stressed the negative effect of tariffs on both our farming communities nationwide and those living and working in border areas already affected by the economic uncertainty of Brexit.  Finally, I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s support for a negotiated resolution to both the Airbus and Boeing disputes.  Ambassador Lighthizer, in his reply to me, did not offer any early relief.<\/p>  <p>  I and my officials, as well as colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, continue to monitor the situation and remain in contact with our US counterparts in Dublin and Washington.  We are also actively engaged with the EU Commission as it seeks to negotiate a resolution on these and other trade matters with the US.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300064#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300064#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[49707\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300064#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the role her Department is playing in advancing disability inclusion in entrepreneurial policy.","asker":"1262","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>SMEs and entrepreneurs are central to our national ambitions for generating broad-based growth and prosperity.

The broad objectives of this approach were to maximise the opportunity for citizen engagement (visitors to NPC &ndash; approx. 300k) to make the overall approach more cost effective, and to have a targeted presence to help citizens get ready for Brexit.  <\/p><p>This approach was co-ordinated centrally from the Department of the Taoiseach, which resulted in a consolidated approach to such activities as staffing, communications and the provision of tickets and sites at NPC. As a result of this approach, a number of items were paid for centrally from this Department, for example, cross-site cleaning, maintenance, waste management, utilities, signage and staff facilities.  This approach resulted in a number of efficiencies being realised, for example, reduced cost of entry for Government staff and the &lsquo;early bird&rsquo; rate being available to all Government attendees for their plot at NPC.  As with all such activities, this area will be reviewed ahead of the 2020 NPC to apply any learnings.  The Department also managed the Government of Ireland marquee, which hosted a number of citizen focused events on topics such as Brexit readiness and the Climate Action Plan.

As a result, new terms and conditions were introduced for personnel enlisting after 1 January 1994 and new contracts for enlisted personnel were for a period of five years&rsquo; service. Since that time, the maximum period of service has been extended out to twenty-one years for line Privates and Corporals.

I also met with senior White House advisor Jared Kushner to discuss the Middle East Peace Process and the situation in the region. In that meeting I clearly conveyed Ireland's encouragement for any efforts that can bring genuine progress, while also making clear Ireland's support for the long-agreed parameters, which any new Middle East peace initiative would need to include, in order to have a realistic prospect of being acceptable to both parties. I also communicated Ireland&rsquo;s well known views on settlements. All settlement activity is illegal under international law, and that view represents the settled international consensus. I have been unequivocal about this in public statements whenever the question of settlements has arisen. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support action on the ground by providing humanitarian assistance and working on specific projects to improve the situation of Palestinians, particularly in Gaza. Ireland has so far provided &euro;5 million to UNRWA in 2019, with additional funding of &euro;2 million in the process of being disbursed.

Officials at my Department in Dublin and at our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; monitor this important issue closely and I have wholeheartedly condemned on numerous occasions any use of threats, intimidation or violence against those working to defend human rights and fundamental freedoms. <\/p>  <p>  The absence of the State in former conflict areas, including in the Cauca Province, and the demobilisation of the FARC, has resulted in other armed groups gaining control of these areas, primarily to control the illegal economy. This has implications for the security of the local communities, particularly for human rights defenders and community leaders, as witnessed in Cauca. <\/p>  <p>  Our new resident Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has been engaging with civil society, EU and multilateral partners on the human rights situation in the country, since it opened at the beginning of the year. We also regularly raise this issue in our exchanges with the Colombian Government, as well as in the Human Rights Council, most recently during the 30th   session of the Universal Periodic Review. During this review we highlighted existing issues in Colombia and made a number of recommendations, including that Colombia takes all necessary measures in order to protect human rights defenders against threats and attacks and to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, former T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore in his position as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process, a role in which he is supported by my Department, led the 11th session of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue. Particular reference was made to the disproportionately high level of violence against indigenous leaders, and the need for collective protection measures.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the Colombian Government&rsquo;s full implementation of the peace agreement. The peace process is fundamental to improving the human rights situation in the country and Ireland has contributed over &euro;14 million in support of this since 2007, mainly channelled through the United Nations, and Colombian and international NGOs focusing on human rights, conflict prevention, peace-building and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. <\/p>  <p>The Taoiseach underlined Ireland's continuing support for the Colombian peace process in his meeting with President Duque en marge   of the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2018.

We also discussed human rights during this meeting. <\/p>  <p>  As well as financial support, Ireland has also provided ongoing support in the form of lesson-sharing based on our own experience of peacebuilding and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  <\/p>  <p>  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:<\/p>  <p>   Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution<\/p>  <p>  The arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code) apply when the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies (i.e. where the property is not the borrower's primary residence).  Amongst other protections, the Code requires that where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears. <\/p>  <p>  Most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm. When a loan is sold, the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply. Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Code and the CCMA.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank carries out its supervision of regulated entities, including banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms in a number of ways, which includes both desk based and on-site reviews of various activities. In March 2018, I asked the Central Bank to review the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders. In November 2018, the Central Bank published a report on this matter. <\/p>  <p>  Based on that point in time exercise, the Central Bank&rsquo;s review concluded that the CCMA is effective and working as intended in the context of the sale of loans, for borrowers who engage with the process. There was no evidence that credit servicing firms do not engage with borrowers in arrears. When a loan is sold by a bank, any existing Alternative Repayment Arrangements (ARAs) in place with a borrower under the CCMA continue to be honoured until the agreed term of the ARA ends.

This scheme enables visitors that are resident outside the EU to benefit from VAT relief on goods purchased in Ireland and subsequently taken outside of the EU.  If the scheme applies to UK visitors post-Brexit and the UK operates a similar scheme for EU visitors, Irish consumers will be able to buy goods VAT free in the UK and UK visitors will be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases in both directions, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses; purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues and collecting VAT on goods in excess of personal importation allowances (if any) brought into Ireland by consumers would be extremely difficult.Due to the volume of passenger movements between the UK and Ireland, the volume of refund applications is likely to significantly increase which simultaneously heightens the risk of abuse of the Retail Export Scheme post Brexit.  <\/p><p>I have also advised that in the event that the UK either restrict the scheme or do not apply it to Irish passenger traffic, Ireland will take the precautionary measures in the form of commencing the sections in the Brexit Act, so to minimise the potential for abuse of the scheme and to reduce the possibility of diversion in retail consumption from Ireland to the UK, post Brexit.<\/p><p>The amended legislation contained in the Brexit Act provides that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme.  This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The monetary limit will apply in respect of all third country travellers who apply for a refund under the scheme, post commencement of the section of the Act.  I have also introduced a new requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.  <\/p><p>The UK government has indicated that it does not intend to apply a VAT Retail Export Scheme to EU Member States post Brexit and I have had no further communication from them on this.  Should the UK apply a full Retail Export Scheme post Brexit, Ireland will not commence the precautionary legislation requiring proof of importation and the associated proof of payment and a non-restricted VAT Retail Export Scheme will therefore operate between Ireland and the UK.  The Government&rsquo;s policy is to reciprocate any arrangements made by the UK, subject to EU law, and any legislative changes that may be made will of course be kept under review by Revenue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300066#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exchequer Returns","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300066#WRG04600"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[50097\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300066#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the projected tax revenue in each of the years 2020 to 2025 in the event of an orderly Brexit by tax category, that is, income, VAT and so on as opposed to a disorderly Brexit as outlined in the economic and fiscal outlook in Budget 2020 in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[50098\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300066#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the projected expenditure in each of the years 2020 to 2025 in the event of an orderly Brexit by expenditure category, that is, compensation of employees, interest expenditure and so on as opposed to a disorderly Brexit as outlined in the economic and fiscal outlook in Budget 2020 in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[50103\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300066#WRG04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the resources available in the event of an orderly Brexit after projected and pre-committed expenditure in each of the years 2020 to 2025 in order to reach a GGB as a percentage of GDP by percentage (details supplied) in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[50104\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300066#WRG05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the resources available in the event of an orderly Brexit after projected and pre-committed expenditure in each of the years 2020 to 2025 in order to reach a structural balance of -0.5 in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 132, 134 and 135 together.<\/p><p>The Government decided in September that <i>Budget 2020<\/i>would be based on the assumption of a disorderly Brexit at end-October.

Also, it is important to note, that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain 0% VAT on goods and services where this has been in effect since 1 January 1991 but cannot extend a 0% rate to new goods or services.

CAT applies, at a rate of 33%, on the excess over the tax free threshold. As CAT is generally payable by the beneficiary, rather than the disponer, the system promotes horizontal equity in that all individuals with similar circumstances are treated in a similar manner.<\/p>  <p>  The three thresholds are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Group A (&euro;335,000) applies where the beneficiary is a child of the disponer.<\/p>  <p>  - Group B (&euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, niece, nephew, or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<\/p>  <p>  - Group C (&euro;16,250) applies in all other cases.<\/p>  <p>  Those who inherit or receive gifts from a disponer who is not their parent will generally fall within either the category B or C thresholds. There would be a significant exchequer cost to any increase in these thresholds. <\/p>  <p>  It is a long-held principle of inheritance tax that transfers of assets between spouses are exempt. The spousal exemption from inheritance tax was extended to civil partners from 1 January 2011. <\/p>  <p>  Depending on the circumstances, there are reliefs available irrespective of the relationship between the individuals concerned, including agricultural relief, business relief and CAT Favourite Niece or Nephew Relief.<\/p>  <p>  Gifts are generally taxable in the same way as inheritances. There is an annual &euro;3,000 CAT relief available to all recipients of gifts, and this does not depend on the relationship of the individuals concerned. <\/p>  <p>  There are some CAT reliefs which are available for cohabiting individuals.  Cohabiting individuals can avail of the &lsquo;dwelling house exemption&rsquo; to bequeath their principal private residence, generally the most substantial asset owned by an individual, free from inheritance tax. This relief is available to people who share a home and meet the conditions of the relief and it is not dependent on the relationship between them. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the gifting of a shared home, the treatment of gifting was amended substantially in the 2016 Finance Act. In general, it is now only possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house where it is gifted to a dependent relative. This change was made to restore the original policy aim of the relief. <\/p>  <p>  Section 88A of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 exempts transfers of property made between qualified cohabitants within the meaning of Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants (CPCROC) Act 2010. This is a redress scheme available, which provides protection in law for long-term cohabiting couples and provides safeguards for an economically dependent cohabitant where a relationship has ended, or on death. The introduction of the exemption from CAT in these cases was not intended to give cohabiting couples the same tax treatment as married couples or civil partners, but simply legislated for the tax consequences of the redress arrangements for cohabitants under the CPCROC Act 2010.  <\/p>  <p>  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples, including with respect to CAT, can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. There would also be potentially significant Exchequer costs in changing the current CAT rules to accommodate the changes sought by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  If the taxpayer has any specific matters which they would like to discuss directly with Revenue they may contact Revenue through their local office, providing further detail of their circumstances.

As the Deputy will be aware however, discussions on the concept of minimum effective corporate tax rates are currently underway at the OECD as part of wider work looking at the tax challenges of digitalisation. The discussions at OECD will likely feed into future debates at EU level.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the OECD discussions remain on a &quot;without prejudice&quot; basis and that a lot of work remains to be done before any agreement on any aspects of the proposals.  <\/p><p>  I have been very clear that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure that we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed.

It essentially provides for business as usual. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the 2021-2027 programming period, the European Commission proposed a special new PEACE PLUS programme to continue and build on the work of both the PEACE and INTERREG programmes , as part of its post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and Cohesion Policy proposals. <\/p>  <p>  The programme development process for PEACE PLUS is now underway, led by SEUPB in close partnership with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in Ireland and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland.

Similarly, good governance results in more efficient use of resources and promotes better informed decision making. Contracting authorities have a responsibility to implement good corporate governance, of which a Corporate Procurement Plan is an important component. Completion of these plans will assist contracting authorities in this and in managing their public procurement activities.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for individual contracting authorities to ensure that their public procurement activities are discharged in line with procurement rules and procedures. The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) supports contracting authorities in this regard by making them aware of their legal and policy obligations in respect to public procurement. In January 2019, OGP published an Information Note on Corporate Procurement Plans. The note is an initiative under the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which sets out the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland. For contracting authorities that are already producing Corporate Procurement Plans the information note will help in the development of future iterations of these.<\/p>  <p>  The European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) plays a crucial role in the digital transformation of public procurement and makes it easier to participate in this market. All public bodies must now issue and accept the ESPD form for all procurement exercises above the EU (OJEU) threshold. It is optional for contracting authorities to use the ESPD service for below threshold competitions. Under EU public procurement directives, ESPD should be provided exclusively in electronic form (eESPD).<\/p>  <p>  In January 2019, OGP published guidance for contracting authorities and suppliers, and an information note, on how ESPD is to be used. The integrated eESPD service, available on eTenders since 28 January 2019, allows buyers to issue an ESPD request form as part of an above threshold procedure and enables suppliers to submit an ESPD response in a fully digitised format. <\/p>  <p>  Since the launch of the service, 73% of OJEU procedures published by Central Government Departments and their agencies have used an eESPD. For all public sector contracting authorities including semi-state and grant funded bodies, 51% of all OJEU procedures have used an eESPD. Suppliers have submitted 3,320 eESPD responses as part of their tender submission for OJEU procedures since January 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300068#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[50028\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300068#WRJ02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on the recommendations in a report (details supplied) with regard to improving SME access to public procurement contracts; if his officials examined the proposal; and the findings of same.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>The Government recognises the importance of the SME sector and continues to enhance the already substantial measures to support SMEs in accessing the public procurement market.

Minister of State O&rsquo;Donovan, in accordance with the Programme for Government, chairs quarterly meetings of the SME Advisory Group so that the voice of industry is heard at first hand by Government. The group comprises officials from OGP, DBEI, Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland, the CCPC, and representatives from Ibec, ISME, the Small Firms Association, the Construction Federation of Ireland and Chambers Ireland.<\/p><p>In June 2018, following consideration by the group of a proposal to raise the threshold for advertising on eTenders, it was decided that the current advertising threshold of &euro;25,000 (excluding VAT) for goods and services be maintained. The proposal had been discussed at meetings of the group and members were invited to submit their views to the OGP with the majority opposed to increasing the advertising threshold at that time.  The OGP also took account of analysis of data on eTenders into their findings and considered the fundamental procurement principles of openness and transparency.<\/p><p>This advertising threshold will be kept under review and OGP is continuing to monitor this issue in consultation with the SME Advisory Group. It is worth noting that the Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2017 report published by the OGP last week, indicates that of the &euro;4.9 billion procurement addressable expenditure analysed, the majority of this spend is with the SME sector.

One of the initiatives emanating from this group is the SME Communication Strategy sub-group, chaired by the OGP, which was established in 2017 as a joint venture with the industry representative bodies. This group further promotes awareness of potential opportunities and supports available for SMEs in tendering for public contracts.  The OGP, working in partnership with the industry representative bodies and other government agencies, has developed a series of online videos and workshops to support smaller businesses build their awareness of procurement opportunities and to develop their capabilities to engage in tender competitions, whether those competitions are at home or abroad. A series of focused and targeted breakfast briefings have also taken place around the country in conjunction with Inter-Trade Ireland and the SME Advisory Group partners. In 2018, OGP representatives attended 50 external events to raise awareness of the public procurement model. This focus on proactive engagement has continued in 2019 with the OGP attending events around the Country including in Athlone, Kildare, Kilkenny, Killarney, Letterkenny and Wexford.<\/p>  <p>  As alluded to by the Deputy, the OGP operates a dedicated Support Helpdesk (from 09.15-17.15 Monday to Friday) that provides advice to public sector bodies and suppliers on a wide range of queries. <\/p>  <p>  Minister of State O&rsquo;Donovan and I wrote to Government Ministers in January asking for their views on implementation of the public procurement reform programme to date and suggestions for improvements.

the provision of External Workplace Investigation Services for central government departments and other public bodies.  The purpose of this particular framework agreement was to establish a panel of external professional investigators to conduct formal workplace investigation services. This framework went live on 27th March 2015 for a four year term with an expiry date of 26th   March 2019.

The membership of this Forum includes public service management and union representatives. <\/p>  <p>  The requirement for such an in-depth examination on the part of the  Community Sector High Level Forum  arose  from the need to ensure that the matter was fully examined having regard to both costs and precedent in the context of the wider Community and Voluntary sector.  <\/p>  <p>   It will be appreciated that the implications arising from this claim extend well beyond the CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors cadre and impact across the entire Community and Voluntary sector. It is accordingly appropriate that the wider sector implications should be fully taken into account in considering the cost implications arising from this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Taking this important consideration into account it is the position that a detailed scoping exercise was carried out by my Department in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues involved.<\/p>  <p>  The scoping exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost exposure for the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the size of the sector which is difficult to ascertain, were consequential demands to be made to fund employer pension contributions for all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors.  This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension for those imminently retiring, as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, give rise to a further Exchequer cost exposure of up to &euro;318 million.<\/p>  <p>  While CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represent only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees would inevitably give rise to claims for similar schemes and funding provision on the part of those many thousands of workers in the broader sector. My Department has to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.<\/p>  <p>  The Forum met in the period subsequent to the conduct of the scoping exercise where relevant matters in respect of this issue were discussed in comprehensive detail with the members of the Forum. These discussions provided a clear understanding to each of the parties of their respective positions in relation to this matter and the formal engagement process between the parties was accordingly concluded on this basis.  <\/p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300069#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300069#WRK00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology Funding","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300069#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[50061\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300069#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of plans to establish funding mechanisms for institutes of technology to support the development of their student accommodation capacity.","asker":"1228","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>Funding provided to the Institute of Technology (IoT) sector currently impacts on the General Government Borrowing (GGB).

As part of a wave migration strategy the ESBS operationalised payroll shared services for three ETBs in 2019. 2020 will see the migration of payroll operations of seven ETBs to the centre.

When fully operational, and providing payroll and related services to all 16 ETBs, it is envisaged that annual savings compared to existing annual costs will be in the region of &euro;1.8 million per annum. Payback for the investment is expected in 8 years from the full commencement of ESBS-ETB payroll shared services.

In this regard, the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005 (links are detailed below). The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;<\/p><p>This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector specifically requires that SNAs are required to work the month of June on examinations and work appropriate to the grade, including training. This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005. This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.<\/p><p>It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June. The utilisation of this period is not specifically for examinations or training purposes only, although these are two of the purposes for which the period of work can be utilised. <\/p><p>Link to the SNA Contract for Employment for the Primary sector:  <\/p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15\/05 (Primary)<\/p><p>www.education.ie\/en\/Circulars-and-Forms\/Active-Circulars\/sna15_05.pdf.<\/p><p>Link to the SNA Contract of Employment for the Post Primary sector:Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12\/05 (Post-Primary) www.education.ie\/en\/Circulars-and-Forms\/Active-Circulars\/sna12_05.pdf.<\/p><p>These contracts of employment are augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs.

I have spoken to a number of staff about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised. <\/p><p>In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries; schools with enrolments of 626-699 to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled, and schools of 700 or more to fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect<\/p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer \/ Board of Management.  <\/p><p>In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars.

A number of organisations including UNHCR Ireland, Amnesty International, NASC and the Irish Red Cross worked closely with me and my Department officials in the development of this programme, which is being delivered under our Irish Refugee Protection Programme. <\/p>  <p>  The programme  is a complementary refugee resettlement stream to the traditional state-centred model.  A key feature of this programme is to give private citizens and community-based organisations an opportunity to directly support a refugee family who are newly arrived to Ireland. Sponsoring communities support the integration of refugee families into Irish society by providing a home and offering opportunities for the family to connect with the local services they need, such as English language tuition, employment, and education pathways.  <\/p>  <p>   The refugee families taking part in the programme do so voluntarily and are identified during selection missions undertaken by my Department. The families have already been granted refugee status by the UNHCR.  Matching of communities with families is done in collaboration with the Irish Red Cross and UNHCR.  Refugees arriving through this programme are afforded the same access to services as Irish citizens including health, education and welfare services.<\/p>  <p>   Under the pilot programme, five communities (in Dunshaughlin, Midleton, Carrigtwohill, Kells and Lismore) welcomed refugee families to their areas.  The five refugee families comprised 17 people in total.  The experience of the communities and the families has been very positive. Last month, the Global Refugee Sponsorship Initiative (GRSI) presented an International Award to Ireland in recognition of the success of the Community Sponsorship Ireland pilot programme.<\/p>  <p>   I formally launched the Community Sponsorship Ireland Programme on 15 November 2019 last in Cork with the support of Nasc, who worked with community groups and refugee families during the pilot programme.  <\/p>  <p>   To further promote the programme, an information leaflet has been prepared outlining the benefits of the programme, for communities and refugees alike.  This leaflet will shortly be distributed to all local authority members throughout the country with an accompanying letter seeking their support in positively promoting the programme in their local communities. In addition, I organised a briefing with Oireachtas members in Leinster House on 19 November. <\/p>  <p>   To provide supports for groups wishing to set up a Community Sponsorship Group in their area, funding is being provided for a number of regional support organisations based around the country. An additional family will be received by a host community in Dublin in the coming weeks.

Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the Convention's requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 provides an important mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD.  The NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, has an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group is currently carrying out a mid-term review of the Strategy, which will examine how it is aligned with the articles of the Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention. The National Disability Authority also plays a critical role in the implementation of the Convention and will be carrying out a review of progress with respect to the Strategy&rsquo;s key indicators in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention. <\/p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to Article 12 is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The 2015 Act will abolish the current Wards of Court system by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced. The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act.  This lead-in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Service. <\/p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published in December 2016. The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.<\/p>  <p>  The monitoring framework will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. In January of this year, IHREC established a Disability Advisory Committee, composed of a diverse group of persons with lived experience of disability. This will ensure the direct participation of persons with disabilities and the organisations representing them in monitoring how the Convention is implemented in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  IHREC is best placed to make periodic independent reports to the UN, supported by progress assessments and statistical information supplied by the NDA.  The NDA has expertise and information resources in relation to reporting on disability issues and is carrying out work in a range of areas to support implementation; including the preparation of non-healthcare Codes of Practice under the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and review of progress with respect to the key indicators of the NDIS.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is progressing Heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty.

The services are mainstreamed and are therefore provided through the Department of Health and the HSE. Residents access GP services through the GMS scheme and are exempt from prescription charges. A fully staffed Medical Centre is located within Mosney. A doctor and a nurse attend each weekday. At weekends, an out of hours Doctor-On-Call Service is available for any urgent medical needs.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to transport, all residents in the centre can avail of a shuttle bus that operates Monday to Saturday (including bank holidays) from Mosney to Drogheda. A church service to Julianstown is also provided every Sunday at 10.30am. A taxi service is available to management to cater for urgent and emergency situations, which may arise for residents. A courtesy car is also available at all times to cater for any other urgent needs for example, taking a parent to collect a sick child from school, etc.<\/p>  <p>  Children living in Mosney attend nine local primary schools and four secondary schools. Bus Eireann School Transport provides transport for all children to and from school each day to schools in Julianstown, Drogheda, Duleek, Tullyallen, Donore, Bettystown and Drumcar.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding more general services and supports for residents, I wish to inform the Deputy that substantial improvements have been made to the reception system in recent years in particular since our voluntary opt-in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive. Residents have access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children and over 3,400 labour market access permissions have been granted to eligible applicants including over 2,500 permissions to residents in accommodation centres.  <\/p>  <p>  In August, Minister Flanagan and I published new National Standards for accommodation centres. These Standards were developed by an Advisory Group including representatives from UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector.

Their purpose is to improve the quality of care and ensure consistency across all accommodation centres.<\/p>  <p>  All accommodation centres including Mosney have 'Friends of the Centre' groups in place, which promote integration by facilitating links between the residents and local community, voluntary and sporting groups.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of services and supports for residents is kept under review.

Its 173 recommendations have implications for a number of Government Departments and services. <\/p><p>My Department has published three progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations; the first in June 2016, the second in February 2017 and a third and final report in July of 2017. All three reports are available to view on my Department's website <i>www.justice.ie<\/i>. The final progress report shows that 133 recommendations have been reported as fully implemented and a further 36 are in progress or partially implemented. This represents a 98% full or partial implementation rate.<\/p><p>While I do not propose to go through the recommendations in detail, I would like to note some important developments in some areas relevant to my Department: <\/p><p>The key recommendation underpinning the Justice McMahon Report was to address the length of time taken to process applications, which can lead to long stays in State provided accommodation.  With the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016, we now have a single application procedure. This is the biggest reform to our protection process in two decades.  It means that an applicant has all aspects of their claim (refugee status, subsidiary protection status, and permission to remain), examined and determined in one process. The aim is to provide first instance decisions in the shortest possible timeframe.  <\/p><p>It has also been noted by a number of commentators, including Justice McMahon himself, that substantial improvements have been made to the Direct Provision system in recent years. Over half of all residents now having access to cooking facilities. It remains my Department&rsquo;s target that all centres will be capable of providing independent living facilities by the end of next year. Since the publication of the Report, we have more than doubled the weekly allowance for children.  Since 25 March 2019, the weekly payments for applicants living in accommodation centres rose to &euro;38.80 per week for adults and &euro;29.80 per week for children.<\/p><p>Residents of accommodation centres may now directly access the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children and information on this right is made available to all residents.<\/p><p>In August, Minister Flanagan and I published new National Standards for accommodation centres. These Standards were developed through an Advisory Group including representatives from UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector. The Standards will come into force in January 2021 and will address a range of themes including accommodation; food and catering; individual, community and family life; health and well-being; governance; and meeting the special reception needs of applicants.  These reforms build on the work done in the McMahon Report and meet the requirements of the EU Recast Reception Conditions Directive (Directive 2013\/33\/EU) which we voluntarily opted into last year. <\/p><p>Access to the labour market has been introduced for eligible applicants. Since its introduction, over 3,400 labour market access permissions have been granted including over 2,500 permissions to residents living in accommodation centres. <\/p><p>Improvements continue to be implemented across the facilities and services provided to those in the protection process and this work will continue. A High Level Interdepartmental Group chaired by my Department has been established, tasked with ensuring better coordination of the provision of services and with meeting the needs of applicants in the short to medium term.  In addition, an Advisory Group chaired by the former Secretary General of the European Commission, Dr. Catherine Day has also been established.  This Group will advise on the development of a long-term approach to the provision of supports including accommodation to people in the international protection process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300074#WRP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[50112\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300074#WRP02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if additional information will be provided further to his officials noting at the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts the establishment of a unit to support persons leaving direct provision centres dedicated to working with direct provision centre managers, local authorities and non-governmental organisations; and the status of plans for the unit.","asker":"1330","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":665,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, residents who have been granted an international protection status (refugee status or subsidiary protection status) or a permission to remain have the same access to housing supports and services as Irish and EEA nationals.

These grounds relate to a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, nationality, religion, political opinions or membership of a particular social group or where the person would be at risk of suffering serious harm if returned to their home country.  <\/p>  <p>  Once a claim is made, a legal process begins and while that process is in train, we offer a range of State services to applicants without means, including accommodation, food, health services, utilities, educational provision for children, a weekly personal payment, etc. There is no obligation to accept this offer and some applicants choose to live with family or friends already in the country or to source and provide for their own accommodation if they have independent means. <\/p>  <p>  The International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department is responsible for examining all applications received. The staff of the IPO (the Chief International Protection Officer and the International Protection Officers) are independent by law in the exercise of their international protection functions. There are currently 146 staff employed in the IPO. There are also a further 50 staff employed in the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, which is responsible for hearing appeals against negative first instance recommendations\/decisions. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years, a number of measures have been introduced aimed at reducing the time taken to determine applications. The most significant reforming measure has been the introduction of a single application procedure under the International Protection Act 2015.  Under the single procedure, all elements of a person's protection claim (refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain) are considered together rather than sequentially as heretofore. <\/p>  <p>  A person who applies for international protection today can expect to receive a first instance recommendation\/decision on their application within approximately 15 months, provided no complications arise. Prioritised cases are currently being processed in just under 9 months. Prioritised applications include those from especially vulnerable groups of applicants, such as unaccompanied minors and applicants from refugee generating countries like Syria and Eritrea. The IPO is working hard to try to achieve a target of 9 months in the vast majority of cases while acknowledging that the processing of applications is complex and that each application deserves and receives an individual assessment.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, the IPO commenced interviews by video conference with applicants based in Cork.  This provides greater flexibility to meet the needs of international protection applicants nationwide and it is planned to roll out this service in other locations shortly.  In addition, I sought and achieved an additional &euro;1m in Budget 2020 under the Justice and Equality vote, which will allow for extra staffing resources to further improve processing times.  <\/p>  <p>  Speeding up the processing of applications has also had a positive impact on the length of time that applicants are spending in accommodation centres. At the end of October, the mean length of stay in an accommodation centre was 21.75 months, down from 38 months in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Where an applicant has been resident in a centre for many years, there are generally complex reasons involved.  For example, the person may have received a negative decision on their application and is exercising their right to appeal including through the courts, which can take some time. Some of those who are longest resident in our centres have already received a status or a permission to remain and are no longer in the international protection process.  There are currently around 860 people with status or permission to remain living in the centres.  The Deputy will be aware of the general difficulties faced by people trying to source and secure accommodation.

I have received the requested information and can inform the Deputy as follows. <\/p>  <p>  First it is important to note that the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW.  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Garda College has three indoor ranges and has sufficient capacity with outdoor ranges for training in the use of firearms by armed Garda&iacute;.  There is also, for example, an indoor firing range at the Galway Divisional Headquarters. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there are currently no plans to construct an additional indoor or outdoor firing range for training of Garda members. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that there has been unprecedented investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years, in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country, to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to the public and deter crime.<\/p>  <p>  A record &euro;1.76 billion was allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019 and this is increasing further to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for 2020.  Significant capital investment is also being made, amounting to a total of &euro;92 million this year and rising further to over &euro;116 million in 2020.  This includes capital investment which is being made in the Garda estate.  The Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is based on agreed Garda priorities. It continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country, underpinned by over &euro;60 million exchequer funding.  The clear goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda&iacute; and members of the public interacting with them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300074#WRP04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":684,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300074#WRP04500"},{"type":"question","counter":685,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[50272\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300074#WRP04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 940 to 944, inclusive, of 23 July 2019, if a response has issued from the Garda Commissioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":686,"content":"<p>I refer to Parliamentary Questions No. 940, 941, 942, 943 and 944 which were for answer on 23 July 2019.

Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015 - 2024 sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to, work are supported and enabled to do so. People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age. The reasons for this are complex, and include employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health. <\/p><p>The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different departments and state agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.

A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region within one percentage point of the national average.  Three regions, Mid-East, West and Dublin, have now exceeded their 2020 targets. Focus is also on creating quality jobs that are sustainable in the longer term in line with Future Jobs Ireland ambitions. <\/p><p>In May 2017, my Department launched Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) with funding of up to &euro;60m aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths. This competitive fund supports significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectorial strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation. <\/p><p>In terms of 2020 targets, and beyond, the national unemployment rate for October 2019 was 4.8 per cent, down from 4.9 per cent in September.  Future Jobs Ireland 2019 sets out a deliberate policy shift encourage quality and sustainable jobs. Skills availability and labour force development are now a key focus with targets focusing on labour force participation rates rather than unemployment rates. Future Jobs Ireland 2019 targets a substantial 3 percentage point increase in overall participation rates for people aged 25 to 69 years to 78% by 2025 with higher increases for females and older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Enterprise Plans","counter":712,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":713,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[50025\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of members of each regional action plan implementation committee per region in tabular form; the gender breakdown; when each committee was first established; and the number of meetings to date.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":714,"content":"<p>The Regional Enterprise Plans (REPs) initiative is a central pillar of the Government's ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, 135,000 of which are outside of Dublin.

Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure significant investments but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that IDA-owned sites are never left intentionally idle or vacant. In fact, the opposite is the case. The IDA is doing everything it possibly can to market these properties to investors and to convince them to locate there. The Agency actively brings regional locations and suitable sites to the attention of all its clients, whether it's for existing companies in Ireland that are looking to expand or first-time clients overseas.<\/p>  <p>  While the IDA itself is focused on inward investment, the Agency manages its property portfolio for the benefit of both its own clients and those of Enterprise Ireland.  The IDA&rsquo;s property team, for example, works closely with Enterprise Ireland to support the needs of indigenous companies who may be seeking appropriate properties. There is also ongoing engagement between the two agencies about the property needs of their respective clients. This includes plans to develop campus style property solutions to support development and business to business collaborations.  <\/p>  <p>  More generally, we are achieving real results in deepening the spread of regional FDI. The IDA&rsquo;s 2018 results bear out that assessment. Last year the Agency delivered 113 regional investments with 56% of net new jobs created outside Dublin. Moreover, the last four years have seen over 44,000 new FDI-driven jobs created outside the capital. We will continue to do our utmost to reinforce and strengthen these positive trends and to further job creation across the entirety of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[50241\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount allocated to businesses and organisations in a town (details supplied) in each of the years 2011 to 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":729,"content":"<p>Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made jobs and enterprise in the regions one of my top priorities.

One of these projects, the development of the Mid East Regional Innovation Think Space (MERITS) enterprise centre in Naas, involves an investment of just over &euro;1.9 million from the REDF. In June of this year I launched a new &euro;45 million third REDF Call it is my intention to announce the successful projects when the evaluation process has ended by the end of this year or shortly thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  Guided by the Regional Enterprise Plan, Co. Kildare and the wider Mid-East region is well positioned to build on the successes to date and to continue to see the benefits and results of collaborative and innovative initiatives that can make a significant impact on enterprise development in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":739,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":740,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[50413\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which job creation through enterprise and innovation continues notwithstanding competition by county; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":741,"content":"<p>The Government has a new plan - Future Jobs Ireland - to ensure we are preparing now for the jobs of the future. While the economy is performing well with strong employment and wage growth, we cannot be complacent. In the past we took success for granted and failed to prepare for emerging challenges, trends and opportunities. It is my priority as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to see more jobs created in the regions.  Regional development is a key priority for this Government and it is important that the value of collaboration and the work by the development agencies, which has yielded strong jobs results in recent years, must be complimented by a bottom-up approach in providing critical business supports and advice.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s results for 2018 show the progress that the Agency has been making in driving enterprise development at a national and regional level.  Enterprise Ireland assisted client companies created 18,846 jobs in 2018 and 64% of the jobs created were outside Dublin with all regions recording increases in employment.  There were 215,207 people employed by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2018, the highest total employment in the history of the Agency.

Last year, 56% of all new jobs created by the Agency&rsquo;s overseas clients were in locations outside Dublin. Every region in the country saw FDI-driven job gains. There are now over 132,000 people employed in IDA client firms outside the capital, representing nearly 60% (58%) of IDA-supported employment. These are all promising figures and show how real strides have been made in boosting FDI-related job creation across Ireland.

I want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth.<\/p>  <p>  Since Q1 2015, when the Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJs) commenced there has been an increase of 312,500 people in employment across the State as at Q3 2019, with an additional 195,600 people living in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period. That is over 62% - or almost 3 out of every 5 jobs created.<\/p>  <p>  During February and March this year, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020. The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential. These stakeholders include: Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, the Higher Education Institutes and others.<\/p>  <p>  These Plans continue the focus on delivering a 10 to 15 per cent employment uplift in each region by 2020 (from Q1 2015), and the unemployment rate of each region reduced to not more than one percentage point above the national average.  <\/p>  <p>  I introduced the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) in 2017 to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects to sustain and add to employment at county, regional and national level.  To date, the REDF has been delivered through two competitive calls, and a total of 42 projects across all regions have together secured just under &euro;60 million. <\/p>  <p>  I announced a further &euro;45 million Call 3 of the REDF in June this year and I expect to be able to announce the successful projects following the completion of the competitive evaluation process by Enterprise Ireland by the end of this year or shortly thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland provides advice and support to indigenous companies all over the country. In addition, through the network of 31 Local Enterprise Offices in every county, Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with the Local Authorities, plays a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. Across the 31 LEOs around the country, 3,656 new jobs were supported in 2018 of which almost 80% were located outside of Co. Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 215,207 people. During that year, 18,846 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,119 jobs, with 61% of new jobs created in 2018 outside Dublin. Currently, 64% of all Enterprise Ireland supported employment is located outside of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Strategy &ldquo;Powering the Regions&rdquo; was launched with a focus on the delivery of key regional initiatives including: <\/p>  <p>  - Increasing productivity and resilience to optimise growth opportunities;<\/p>  <p>  - Collaborate in the growth of microenterprises, HPSUs, female entrepreneurship;<\/p>  <p>  - Optimise enterprise growth in cities, urban and rural locations;<\/p>  <p>  - Support the development of co-working and incubation spaces;<\/p>  <p>  - Implement an initiative on second-site locations in the regions; and<\/p>  <p>  - Deliver a collaborative strategy to deliver Food Direct Investment in the regions.<\/p>  <p>  As regards attracting Foreign Direct Investment in the past year (2018) every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment (FDI) employment gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. Furthermore, 56% of all net new FDI jobs created last year were based in regional locations which represents more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. At the end of 2018, 58% of all IDA supported employment was located outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  Attracting FDI to regional areas is not without its challenges The IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP) remains an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to locate in areas outside of Dublin.  Budget 2019 saw the Agency allocated an additional &euro;10m for the RPP on top of the &euro;150 m for the RPP launched in 2015. The IDA plans to develop new buildings in regional locations including Carlow, Dundalk, Monaghan, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, strategic investments within the overarching national context, through Project Ireland 2040 are also key to ensuring each region can contribute to, and participate in Ireland&rsquo;s future national growth, and sustain a higher standard of living over the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":748,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ05000"},{"type":"question","counter":749,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[50416\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ05100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to assist small and medium enterprises; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":750,"content":"<p>My Department and I are fully committed to the continued growth and development of our small and medium indigenous enterprises.

As recognised in Future Jobs Ireland, increasing female participation is a vital way to grow the diversity and strength of our indigenous business sector. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, and Government as a whole, continue to monitor and assess the number of women in business. While I welcome Ireland&rsquo;s recent improvement to 5th from a previous 8th position in Europe for the rate of female entrepreneurship in the 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Report, there is more we can achieve. <\/p>  <p>   My Department, together with Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), have introduced a number of initiatives to increase female participation in business, such as EI's female-only Competitive Start Up Fund, and female-specific training and mentoring programmes run by the LEOs. <\/p>  <p>   The LEOs actively engage in encouraging and inspiring female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks. <\/p>  <p>On October 17th  , over 1,600 female entrepreneurs attended 17 strategically organised LEO events to celebrate their National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day. Each year this event gains further momentum, encouraging the promotion of female entrepreneurship, showcasing what supports are available to women in business. All 31 LEOs were behind the initiative and they enlisted the help of established entrepreneurs to act as Regional Ambassadors, to share their success stories at the events. <\/p>  <p>   This growth in popularity has been reflected in the national growth in female entrepreneurship. In 2018, 22,000 business women availed of LEO-led mentoring and training programmes specifically targeted towards female entrepreneurship -  this represented a 19% increase on similar targeted services in 2017. <\/p>  <p>   EI has also developed a series of female accelerator programmes in partnership with knowledge providers such as Going for Growth, the National Digital Research Centres (NDRC) Female Founders Programme, Dublin BIC Innovate, and DCU Ryan Academy Female Highfliers.<\/p>  <p>   To promote and support the number of women working in business and becoming entrepreneurs, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to review and bring forward a new Female Entrepreneurship Strategy. This new strategy will have a specific focus on addressing barriers to women in business including attitudes to risk, access to finance, networking opportunities and visible role models. <\/p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s new strategy will also include initiatives to support women progressing to senior levels in business and to improve the broader entrepreneurship policy environment for women. The strategy will also target an increase in the numbers of ambitious female-led companies that scale in international markets, and increasing the numbers of female-founded high potential start-ups. Showcasing female entrepreneur role models and highlighting female achievements in enterprise are essential to encouraging more women to establish a business. <\/p>  <p>  I, and my Department, have worked intensively to shine a light of female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models with targeted events and awards including Network Ireland&rsquo;s \"Business Networking for Women Across Ireland\", the 30% Club, and the Planet Woman Academy. <\/p>  <p>The implementation of this strategy has had a positive impact on the number of female founders, for example increasing by 15% the number of female founders of High Potential Start Ups across the period 2011 to 2018. To build on the success of this strategy, Enterprise Ireland is finalising a new Women in Enterprise Strategy  . This strategy will be published in January 2020. <\/p>  <p>  I, and my Department and its Agencies, will continue to advocate and promote the importance of increasing representation of our female entrepreneurs amongst Ireland&rsquo;s business ecosystem. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":754,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":755,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[50418\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ05700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to promote, generate and support Irish business at home and abroad in view of ongoing challenges such as Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":756,"content":"<p>The Government has a new plan - Future Jobs Ireland - to ensure we are preparing now for the jobs of the future. While the economy is performing well with strong employment and unemployment down to 4.8% in October this year, we cannot be complacent. In the past we took success for granted and failed to prepare for emerging challenges, trends and opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy. These include funds, policies and initiatives that will enhance productivity, especially among SMEs; promote indigenous entrepreneurship, especially in the regions, encourage clustering and stronger links between domestic and foreign owned firms, and, assist businesses to move up the value chain, to protect jobs and to build resilience for the future.<\/p>  <p>  The long-term response to Brexit is for companies across all sectors to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more international markets. The agencies under my Department have a wide range of supports available to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK, and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s results for 2018 show the progress that the Agency have been making in supporting and driving the creation of new enterprises in the indigenous sector at a national and regional level.  Client companies assisted by Enterprise Ireland (EI) created 18,896 jobs in 2018 and 64% of the jobs created were outside Dublin, with all regions recording increases in employment.  There were 217,186 people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies in 2018, the highest total employment in the history of the agency. Exports also reached a new record high of &euro;23.8 billion in 2018.  Importantly, these EI client firms have extensive links to their local economies around the country and EI client purchases of raw material and services and wages to direct employees exceeded &euro;27 billion in 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland clients' exports continued to rise for a ninth consecutive year and now stand at &euro;23.8 billion, the highest level in the history of the State.  This represents a 6% increase on 2017, and a &euro;10.9 billion increase in exports since 2009.<\/p>  <p>  During 2018, EI progressed with its strategic ambition to expand the Irish export footprint, by growing exports beyond the UK, while consolidating and building upon hard-won UK market positions.  The 2018 export figures confirm that EIs clients are exporting more than ever before, to more diversified markets than ever before. Importantly, 417 companies established new overseas presences in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In the UK, which is and will remain, EI clients' largest market, exports remained strong and increased by 4%, despite the prevailing challenges of volatility and uncertainty.  EI progressed with their ambition to reduce overall UK market exposure to one-third by 2020. During 2018 EI achieved a further one per cent reduction in UK market exposure, reducing it to 33%, down more than 10% over the years, reflecting the success Irish companies are having in substantially increasing and broadening their exports to other international markets.<\/p>  <p>  The Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland's diversification strategy, saw growth of 7.6% to &euro;4.8bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports. <\/p>  <p>  I officially opened Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new office in Munich last week, which is their second office in Germany.  It is one of seven new offices that the Government is funding in key markets worldwide, as part of our overseas strategy, Global Ireland 2025, which aims to double our international impact.  Market diversification has never been more important than it is now with Brexit on the horizon.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is to assist client companies to build on the strength of their 2018 performance by supporting them to start, innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint. In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, a Global Ambition campaign launched and an intensive programme initiated to support companies to take action and plan for Brexit so that they have the resilience necessary to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by any kind of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a broad range of supports to help companies prepare for Brexit including the Brexit Scorecard, Be Prepared Grant, Advisory Clinics, Agile Innovation Fund, Operational Excellence Offer and Market Discovery Fund. Recently launched EI supports including online Customs Training and Act On Consultancy.  In addition, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) recently launched their customs training offering which is available to all companies.  Furthermore, the suite of enterprise supports in place cover a range of potential Brexit impacts.  These range from liquidity support through short term and longer term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties, including an EU State aid approved Rescue and Restructure Scheme to deal with sudden shocks and an expanded network of overseas offices and in-market supports to help firms diversify markets and to consolidate market share in the UK where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are located throughout the country and provide a range of supports for the micro and small business sector. The LEOs act as the &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business.  The Government agreed to increase funding for the LEOs by 22% in 2019 and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and to build resilience against Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  To drive awareness of the importance of preparing for Brexit, a number of regional advisory clinics have been held by Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs around the country.<\/p>  <p>  It is also vital that businesses themselves prepare for Brexit impacts and take actions to mitigate against any adverse effects. Firms that do business with the UK, whether buying goods or exporting products, should in particular, examine their supply chains to determine their vulnerabilities and take appropriate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":757,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ05900"},{"type":"question","counter":758,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[50419\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300075#WRQ06000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which adequate incentives remain available to encourage the indigenous sector with particular reference to job creation enterprises; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":759,"content":"<p>The Government has a new plan - Future Jobs Ireland - to ensure we are preparing now for the jobs of the future.

A number of these ambitions are centred on flexible working solutions which can offer benefits for employers, employees and wider society in general. <\/p>  <p>  Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Flexible working solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work-life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so. <\/p>  <p>  Ambition 4.2 of Future Jobs Ireland places focus on fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. This Ambition includes deliverables such as the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options, the extension of unpaid Parental Leave, and a consultation on work-life balance which the Department of Justice and Equality will be launching shortly, to identify further areas of consideration for flexible working. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently leading on research on remote working under Ambition 4.2(I).

Under the terms of the CBD, patients in Ireland can seek to be referred to another EU\/EEA country for medical treatment that is available in the public health service in Ireland. The patient may access the overseas service in either the public or private health sector of the country they choose to receive the service in.  The patient pays for the treatment and claims reimbursement from the HSE at the cost of that treatment in Ireland or the cost of it abroad, whichever is the lesser. The HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the operation of the CBD.<\/p><p>The Deputy should advise the patient's family to contact the HSE TAS\/NCP offices for advice on making an application for treatment abroad under the most appropriate scheme, in advance of travelling abroad. The TAS office may be contacted in writing at the TAS Office,<b><\/b>St. Canice&rsquo;s Hospital Complex, Dublin Road, Kilkenny or by email treatmentabroad.scheme@hse.ie. Dedicated phone numbers for each county are available on the TAS website. The CBD National Contact Point may be contacted in writing at HSE Cross Border Directive, St Canice's Hospital, Dublin Road, Kilkenny or by email: crossborderdirective@hse.ie or by telephone 056 778 4546.

This was part of a service improvement programme to streamline services, and their delivery, to make the Service easier to understand and to reduce the complexity of the application process for clients.<\/p>  <p>  Home supports enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities, as well as facilitating timely discharge from hospital. In line with Programme for Government commitments we have made improved access to home support services a priority. We have committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in Budget 2020 for home supports and next year the HSE aims to deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support. This represents a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.   <\/p>  <p>  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and reducing the current waiting lists for the service being experienced in almost all areas. As appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand in Winter 2019-2020, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for our older citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2020 has been submitted and is under consideration in my Department. The allocation of hours and targets to Community Healthcare Organisations is currently underway and I have been advised that this will be finalised in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of a statutory homecare scheme by the end of 2021.  As part of this, work is on-going to determine the optimal approach to the development of the scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms and in 2019 and 2020 work is focusing on the design of the scheme, the options for regulation, financing and a review of existing services, which is ongoing. Stakeholder consultation and engagement will continue throughout the development of the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Of the additional &euro;52m allocated in Budget 2020 for home support services, a proportion of this funding will be used to test a reformed model of service delivery in 2020 at pilot sites. My Department is currently working with the HSE to identify the pilot sites and to agree the approach to testing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","counter":928,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT04900"},{"type":"question","counter":929,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[49927\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of addiction liaison midwives that have been funded nationwide;  the number currently in post; and the plans in place to fill the outstanding posts including University Maternity Hospital, Limerick.","asker":"1325","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":930,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":931,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05200"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[49935\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the recent closing of the stoma clinic at University Hospital Waterford; if it is only UHW affected by the closure; if it is a new change of policy; the stoma support facilities and-or resources in place throughout other regional hospitals in comparison such as Cork and  Limerick; and if information on the reopening and-or the contingencies being put in place will be provided.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":933,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Question Heading for question(s)  374","counter":934,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05500"},{"type":"question","counter":935,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[49937\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of equipment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":936,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":937,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05800"},{"type":"question","counter":938,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[49944\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300078#WRT05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":939,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

In line with Programme for Government commitments we have made improved access to home support services a priority. We have committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in Budget 2020 for home supports and next year the HSE aims to deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support. This represents a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.<\/p>  <p>  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and reducing the current waiting lists for the service being experienced in almost all areas. As appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand in Winter 2019-2020, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for our older citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2020 has been submitted and is under consideration in my Department. The allocation of hours and targets to Community Healthcare Organisations is currently underway and I have been advised that this will be finalised in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of a statutory homecare scheme by the end of 2021.  As part of this, work is on-going to determine the optimal approach to the development of the scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms and in 2019 and 2020 work is focusing on the design of the scheme, the options for regulation, financing and a review of existing services, which is ongoing. Stakeholder consultation and engagement will continue throughout the development of the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Of the additional &euro;52m allocated in Budget 2020 for home support services, a proportion of this funding will be used to test a reformed model of service delivery in 2020 at pilot sites.

question:<\/p>  <p>1.   Children and Family Relationships Act 2015<\/p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted to modernise family law in a way that is inclusive of and sensitive to the reality of contemporary family life in Ireland and to meet the needs of children living in diverse family types.  Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act, which are my responsibility as the Minister for Health, are key elements of the Act and are concerned with the rights of children conceived through the use of donor embryos or gametes. <\/p>  <p>  Last month, I signed the Commencement Orders and Regulations for Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act and the Regulations will come into effect on 5 May 2020.  The Regulations include a declaration of parentage regulation and a certification regulation which for the first time allows the intending mother of a donor-conceived child, i.e. the woman who gives birth to the child, to name their spouse, civil partner or co-habitant as the second parent of the child, subject to the consent of both parties.  A parent under this section shall have all parental rights and duties in respect of the child.  The donor of a gamete or embryo shall not be a parent of that child and shall have no parental rights or duties in respect of that child.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 will clarify the legal position of all parties involved in donor-assisted human reproduction procedures carried out in the State, but particularly the children born from such procedures.<\/p>  <p>2.   Assisted Human Reproduction Bill<\/p>  <p>  The Government approved the drafting of a bill on assisted human reproduction (AHR) and associated areas of research, based on the published General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill.  This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time, of a range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research.  The General Scheme also provides for an independent regulatory authority for AHR.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health published the report of its review of the General Scheme on 11 July 2019, as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January 2018.  The Committee makes 11 main recommendations, which include proposals both related to broad policy objectives and more technical amendments.  <\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee&rsquo;s report and its recommendations will be considered as part of the ongoing process of drafting the bill in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, but the Deputy should be aware that I consider the progression of this legislation to be a priority.<\/p>  <p>3.

Research suggests that the biogas produced from AD could potentially play a significant role in the heat and transport sectors. <\/p><p>The role indigenous sources of renewable energy will play in future will become more important as we seek to reduce our reliance on imported fuels and in meeting our challenging renewable energy targets into the future and decarbonising our energy systems by 2050.  <\/p><p>The Anaerobic Digestion industry in Ireland is still at an early stage of development when compared to the more established industry in mainland Europe. Models for AD plants in Ireland are varied and are typically stand alone on-farm plants which rely on own-sourced manure from farming activity in addition to other feedstocks such as foodwaste to supply a continued raw material for power generation. <\/p><p>There are many challenges, both economic and operational, to the establishment of a viable Anaerobic Digestion industry in Ireland. The cost efficiency of this technology remains challenging due to the low energy content of farm manure and the seasonality of grass\/slurry supply under Irish farming conditions.<\/p><p>The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) aims to bridge this economic gap and will support farms and businesses to adopt renewable heating systems, including biogas heating systems.  The SSRH has been developed to financially support the adoption of renewable heating systems by agricultural, commercial, industrial, district heating operators and other non-domestic heat users not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the rollout of the SSRH for the period of up to 2027.<\/p><p>In June of this year, my colleague Richard Bruton, Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, opened the second phase of the SSRH. Details of this scheme including the tariffs that apply are available on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's website at the following link: .<\/p><p>While there are currently no grants available for the building of anaerobic digestors, Teagasc is currently developing a feasibility study on the availability of sustainable feedstocks in Ireland which are essential for a viable industry. This report will help to inform the types of support necessary for the future development of the anaerobic digestion industry in Ireland.<\/p><p>Despite these challenges, my Department is committed to working with the Department for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which is the lead Department in this area, to ensure that the supply of domestic fuels available in the forest and agriculture sectors are mobilised to support energy generation from a range of bioenergy technologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":1181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1182,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[49923\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a forestry application by a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1183,"content":"<p>An application for the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme was made on behalf of the person named in June 2019.

These include free upgrades for low income households and fixed grants for those who can invest some of their own money. The grants promote a fabric first approach &ndash; advising people to first reduce heat losses by installing insulation and ventilation, making it easier to keep a home warmer and more comfortable for longer periods, before moving to installation of new or renewable heating systems.   Since 2000, over 400,000 homes have received direct support under these schemes to carry out work to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. This year, I have allocated &euro;100 million funding for these schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Grants are available to homeowners through the Better Energy Homes Scheme for attic and wall insulation and heating controls, as well as for more environmentally friendly heating sources such as heat pumps (including air to water heat pumps). The heat pump grant is currently &euro;3,500. However, homes must meet a certain level of energy efficiency in order to qualify for the grant. The installation of heat pumps can also be supported as part of a deeper energy efficiency upgrade under the Better Energy Communities Scheme. This scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area &ndash; homes, including those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses. It also encourages innovative measures and solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":1214,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1215,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[49715\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the initial investment in the national broadband plan by companies (details supplied).","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1216,"qnumday":470,"qnumall":"[49716\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when a company (details supplied) first indicated that it would be investing in the national broadband plan.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1217,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[49717\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the contractual responsibilities of a company (details supplied) in the context of the national broadband plan.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1218,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[49718\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the due diligence undertaken of a company (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1219,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[49719\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he has met with representatives of a company (details supplied); and if so, the context and the date of the meetings.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[49720\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when his attention was drawn to the fact that a company (details supplied) was no longer a financial backer of the national broadband plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1221,"qnumday":476,"qnumall":"[49722\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the contract for the national broadband plan requires a company (details supplied) to make further investments in a scenario in which the plan requires additional funding; if they are contained within the signed contract; if the details of the requirements will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1222,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[49723\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300083#WRY04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if a company (details supplied) submitted a pre-qualification questionnaire; if so, the date on which it was submitted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1223,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 469 to 474, inclusive, 476 and 477 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland. It is vital that we ensure that people of rural Ireland have the same opportunities as people in our towns and cities. <\/p>  <p>  The fundamental building blocks of the project, which is designed to bring fibre to the home to over 1.1 million people in the intervention area, have not changed since the procurement process commenced. The project is led by Granahan McCourt, supported by key subcontractors enet and the Kelly Group, with Nokia as the provider of electronic equipment. <\/p>  <p>  After appointment as the preferred bidder, the sponsors were required to finalise a number of steps before a contract could be signed. The Department was also required to carry out the necessary due diligence. <\/p>  <p>  These steps included: <\/p>  <p>  - Closing out contracts with infrastructure access providers (eir and enet), civil engineering companies and equipment providers <\/p>  <p>  - Concluding the contractual provision in the 3,000 page contract. <\/p>  <p>  - Finalisation of the committed equity documents with the shareholders of the new company, National Broadband Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  As is standard in large projects, including PPPs, the final mix of shareholders to the project is concluded where all contractual documents have been finalised. The NBP process has been no different in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The procurement process for the National Broadband Plan contract includes a mechanism for the Department to assess and approve, or reject, changes to the membership of bidders. This assessment is carried out by ring fenced teams with similar make up to the teams that carried out the evaluation of the final tender, and overseen by a review panel and the Procurement Board. I have no role in the assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The bidder proposed for contract award that McCourt Global LLC be replaced by Oak Hill. The proposed bidder change was submitted to the Department on 11 November 2019. The entity referred to by the Deputy submitted documentation, as a bidder member, as part of the submission by the lead bidder (Granahan McCourt). The due diligence was carried out against the conditions set out in the assessment process and was approved. <\/p>  <p>  The Project Information Memorandum (PIM) dated December 2015 sets out the procurement process for the NBP. Relevant documents are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the assessment of a change, the relevant bidder is required to demonstrate that it continued to meet the economic and financial standing, together with technical and professional capacity, set out in the original pre-qualification criteria. The Department could not approve a change in bidder composition unless the relevant bidder met those criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The funding commitments of National Broadband Ireland (NBI), including the equity and working capital commitments of &euro;223m, have been contractualised as part of the contract award. The contract is with NBI and not with the entity referred to by the Deputy, which is an equity investor. Neither, I nor my officials have met with the entity referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that any modifications to shareholding made after Final Tender would be reviewed by the Department in advance of Contract Award, was set out in information provided to the Oireachtas after the appointment of NBI as preferred Bidder and this information is included in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action and Environment in relation to the NBP. <\/p>  <p>  The maximum possible investment by the State for the NBP contract will be &euro;2.977 billion over 25 years.

The initial selection and prioritisation of works is a matter for each local authority.<\/p>  <p>  There were major cutbacks in funding for the road network in general during the recession. Project Ireland 2040 provides for a gradual increase in grant assistance for regional and local roads and there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding particularly in the last two years - the &euro;483 million allocated this year represents an increase of nearly 50% compared to 2017.  However, the amount available is not sufficient to achieve &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; levels of investment.  <\/p>  <p>   Within the budget available to my Department, grant funding is allocated on the basis of grant programmes and not on the basis of the category of road.  My Department does not, therefore, have the details sought by the Deputy regarding the resurfacing of Class 3 roads since 2016.  The allocation of funding across specific roads or across categories is a matter for each local authority, having regard to the funding available to it from local and central sources as well as its particular priorities.<\/p>  <p>  The main Regional and Local Road Grant programmes are focussed on specific policy objectives i.e. surface sealing to protect the road surface from water damage, road strengthening based on pavement condition rating to lengthen the life of roads and a Discretionary Grant Scheme which allows for a specified range of activities including winter maintenance.  These 3 grant programmes account for most of the grant funding and are allocated taking into account the length of the road network and traffic factors in a particular local authority area.  Apart from a requirement that 15% of the road strengthening grant is spent on regional roads, the allocation of funding to different categories of road is entirely a matter for decision by each local authority.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department does facilitate community participation in the repair of local roads.  The statutory underpinning for local community involvement in road works was put in place in the Roads Act, 1993, as amended.  Section 13(6) of the Act provides that a person, or group of persons, may with the consent of the road authority carry out maintenance and improvement works on a local road.  <\/p>  <p>  Road authorities had the option for many years of using part of their grant allocation for community involvement schemes if they wished to do so. A pilot Community Involvement Scheme with ring-fenced funding operated for two years in 2013 and 2014 and was well received. The recession did impact on the repair of less trafficked local roads as these roads tend to be considered towards the end of road authorities&rsquo; roadworks programmes.  I re-introduced ring-fenced finding for CIS in 2018 with a view to allowing these local roads to be repaired sooner than might otherwise be the case and there has been a good uptake of the scheme. The Scheme is purely voluntary and does not take away from the statutory responsibilities of each road authority. <\/p>  <p>  There is a common misconception that annual motor tax is in some way related to funding for roads.  While historically the Local Government Fund did receive the proceeds of motor tax, as part of a source of funding for local authorities across their programmes (not just roads), this is no longer the case.  Motor Tax receipts are now received directly by the Exchequer and form part of general taxation.  there is therefore no relationship between the amount of tax due from owners of vehicles in a given location and the amount of local spending on roads in that location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300085#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Status","counter":1312,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300085#WRAA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1313,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[49983\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300085#WRAA04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will reconsider the upgrade of the N81 as a priority for future capital roads plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1314,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.

As you are aware, AIM is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with a disability can access the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) (free pre-school) programme. The key objective of AIM is to support early learning and care providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that children with a disability can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality pre-school education.<\/p>  <p> I understand that your query relates specifically to an application for Additional Assistance &ndash; AIM Level 7.  All applications take time, which is why it is advisable to apply well in advance of the child commencing on the ECCE Programme, in order to allow for an observation visit of the child in the early learning and care setting to be carried out.  In this instance the application for supports through AIM was received on 10th July 2019. An observation visit was conducted on 3rd   September 2019, once the child had started attending the setting, by a Better Start Early Years Specialist. Following review and appraisal of the recommendation by the Early Years Specialist, Pobal communicated the final decision to the early learning and care provider on 18th October 2019.<\/p>  <p>   In relation to the granting of 30 weeks funding, this has been allocated as per the AIM programme rules which state that backdating of AIM Level 7 payments is not permitted. The reason backdating of AIM Level 7 payments is not permitted is because AIM provides a range of supports, both universal and targeted. In many cases the universal supports provided through AIM, which include staff training, are sufficient to enable the full participation of a child with a disability. In relation to targeted supports, having reviewed the needs of a child in the context of the early learning and care setting, an Early Years Specialist may provide advice on strategies to support the child's inclusion. In some cases, the Early Years Specialist may recommend funding for additional assistance, either to allow for an additional staff member or to enable a reduction in the adult to child ratio.<\/p>  <p>   Funding for an additional staff member is therefore only one of a range of supports provided under AIM, and may not be the most appropriate support. Where an application for AIM support is submitted, an Early Years Specialist determines the most appropriate type of support, depending on the needs of the child in the context of the early learning and care setting. It would therefore not be appropriate for an additional staff member to be recruited until funding for this purpose is approved. <\/p>  <p>   Since the September 2019 programme call opened on May 1st, the average response time from submission of an Access and Inclusion Profile to conducting an observation visit for a child or children in the ECCE programme - which is necessary to determine the level of need - has been 26 days. This is within the expected timeline as per the Access and Inclusion Profile guidance, which states that, following a review of the information provided, a member of the Better Start Access and Inclusion team will contact the pre-school within 4-6 weeks of submission.<\/p>  <p>  Once an observation visit has taken place, an Early Years Specialist within Better Start completes a report, which goes through a review and appraisal process. On average the time from observation to final decision is 23 days. Therefore, in total, from observation visit to decision it takes on average 49 days to process an AIM application.  In this case, approvals were given within these timeframes.  Payment for the AIM Level 7 &ndash; Additional Assistance was awarded from the Monday after the approval, and was awarded for the remainder of the preschool year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Counselling Services Provision","counter":1397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1398,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[49866\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to continue to fund the low-cost counselling service at a facility (details supplied): if a grant of &euro;9,280 for 2019 will be approved; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1399,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency funds a range of services in the community and voluntary sector to provide services to children and families, including counselling services such as those provided at the facility referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>I have requested Tusla to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the allocation of funding for 2019 to the facility referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":1400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1401,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[49898\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of external consultant reports commissioned by her Department in each year from March 2011 to 2018 and to date in 2019; the cost of each report; the company involved; and the title and publication date by report in tabular form.","asker":"1218","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1402,"content":"<p>My Department is currently compiling the information requested and will revert to the Deputy as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Funding","counter":1403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1404,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[50051\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300087#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the subsidy payable to a person (details supplied) under both the CCSP and national childcare scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1405,"content":"<p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) opened on the 20th November 2019.

For the programme year that began in September 2019, the window for applications opened on 1st May 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Since the September 2019 programme call opened on May 1st, the average response time from submission of an Access and Inclusion Profile to conducting an observation visit for a child or children in the ECCE programme - which is necessary to determine the level of need - has been 26 days.

Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a social insurance based scheme and applicants must have sufficient insurance contributions and suffered a substantial loss of employment to qualify. The 2020 revised estimates for my Department provide for expenditure next year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme of &euro;354.4 million.<\/p>  <p>  To be eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full time employment.  It is a fundamental condition for both jobseekers schemes that a person must also be fully unemployed for 4 days in any period of 7 consecutive days. The social insurance contribution condition requires a jobseeker to have at least 104 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid since they first started work and 39 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year or, 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year.  The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim was made. So, for claims made in 2019 the relevant tax year is 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  In the case of a person who normally works full time but their hours are reduced by their employer on a temporary basis they may be entitled to receive jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the days that they don&rsquo;t work provided that they meet all the conditions of the scheme including that they cannot work for more than 3 days in 7 consecutive days.  This is known as systematic short time working and the person&rsquo;s Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is not taxable. If a person works part time and their hours are temporarily reduced they are not treated as a systematic short time worker, they are treated as a part time worker and their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is taxable. They must also be genuinely seeking full time work to continue to be eligible for the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  If a person does not meet the conditions to qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they may apply for means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the jobseekers schemes another in-work support scheme offered by my Department is the Working Family Payment, which provides an income top-up for employees who have child dependents and they are on low earnings.  To qualify for this payment, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  The payment effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if s\/he were claiming other social welfare payments.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  However, any changes to the current criteria, such as moving to an hours-based system, could result in significant numbers of additional individuals becoming eligible for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment with the substantial corresponding costs for the Exchequer. In addition, if there were a change from a days-based to an hours-based system, existing casual jobseekers could lose out if their current hours worked over three days exceeded the new hour&rsquo;s threshold, creating a disincentive to work longer. This is an important policy issue for the Department which is kept under review in a budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300088#WRDD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":1460,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300088#WRDD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1461,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[49727\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300088#WRDD01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made on an application by a person (details supplied); the reason for the delay; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1462,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that as a result they require that level of care.<\/p><p>I confirm that my department received an application for CA from the person concerned on 24 October 2019.  <\/p><p>A person can be considered to be providing full-time care and attention where they are engaged in employment, self-employment or on training courses outside the home for a maximum of 15 hours per week, provided that they can show to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that adequate care has been provided for the care recipient in their absence.<\/p><p>As the applicant is engaged in farming the matter was referred to a local social welfare inspector (SWI) on 25 November 2019 to assess the level of care being provided, assess means and confirm that all the conditions for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are satisfied.<\/p><p>Once the SWI has reported, a decision will be made without delay and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300088#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":1463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300088#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1464,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[49761\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300088#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason a disability allowance application by a person (details supplied) has been refused; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1339","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1465,"content":"<p>The Department has not received an application for Disability Allowance from the person concerned.<\/p><p>However, the person concerned did apply for Illness Benefit from May 2019.

State pension age will increase to 67 in 2021.  As the person concerned was born in 1955 they will reach pension age in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  For those who reach state pension age since September 2012, two different methods of calculating entitlement to a contributory state pension are used, the yearly averaging (YA) approach used since the inception of the contributory pension in 1961 and an interim total contributions approach (TCA).  The customer receives the higher rate of the two calculations.   <\/p>  <p>  Future pension entitlement will likely depend on factors such as a person&rsquo;s social insurance record, their attachment to the workforce, and their countries of employment. It is advisable that all contributors maintain their social insurance record over their working life.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) announced that the Government would introduce a new method for calculating State pension (contributory).

The implementation of the TCA is subject to the necessary legislation being enacted and supporting structures in place.  <\/p>  <p>  I have arranged for a copy of their social insurance contribution record to issue to the person concerned.

In  2018, my Department spent &euro;5.5m on the FEAD programme through the ongoing distribution of food and the distribution of material assistance in the areas of school kits and new migrants. Though a network of charitable partnership organisations, the Department distributed over 1,300 tonnes of food to almost 152,000 people in communities throughout the country, either in the form of food parcels or as meals prepared by charitable organisation. To date in 2019, &euro;5.2m has been spent on the FEAD programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Difficulty in meeting food and other regular ongoing needs may result from a family encountering exceptional once-off expenditures.

Crucially, it facilitates up to 20 years of HomeCaring periods to be added to paid contributions to increase a person&rsquo;s rate.  It effectively means that the minimum number of paid contributions of 20 years needed for a full rate pension is as the National Pensions Framework suggested.  However the additional scope for home caring potentially allows more people, particularly women who took time out of the work place to care for children and others, to earn a higher rate pension.<\/p>  <p>  PRSI contributions can be credited to people in a number of contexts and as such up to 10 years of credits, for example Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used subject to the total of such credits and HomeCaring periods not exceeding 20 years.

They work with building owners to ensure that immediate risks are addressed and that a plan is put in place, where required, for works to bring buildings into compliance. Local authorities are independent in carrying out these functions. <\/p><p>In relation to legacy issues, in general building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, that is the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  <\/p><p>The State has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters. It is not possible for the State to take on responsibility\/liability for all legacy issues nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance. <\/p><p>The legislative position is very clear in terms of where responsibility of property ownership lies for identifying the need for, arranging of, and funding remedial works where need for such is identified.  <\/p><p>When a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. The person having control is required to take reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons in the event of fire. In multi-unit developments, the &quot;person having control&quot; is generally the Owner Management Company.  <\/p><p>Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, (which is under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality), the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development. <\/p><p>In response to the building failures that have emerged over the past decade, Government has embarked on a three pronged Building Control Reform Agenda &ndash; to reduce the risk of similar problems occurring again&ndash; centred on:  <\/p><p>1. Reform of the Building Control process  <\/p><p>2. Establishment of a National Building Control Management Project <\/p><p>3. Putting the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing. <\/p><p>It was through the Building Control (Amendment<i>) <\/i>Regulations 2014<i>, <\/i>known within the industry as BCAR, and accompanying code of practice that the roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers have been set out and clarified. BCAR requires the owner to assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he\/she has commissioned. They in turn, must account for their contribution through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates. Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. <\/p><p>If and when issues arise whether pre, during or post construction, it is clear who has held the designated roles and who is responsible for addressing the issues. This facilitates and simplifies the inspection, implementation and enforcement role of the Building Control Authority.  <\/p><p>The building control function has been strengthened by the establishment of the National Building Control Office, which provides oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control in local authorities. The inspections policy is being reviewed and developed to support local authorities identify risk and make the most efficient and effective use of the resources available. <\/p><p>The Government has committed to placing the Construction Industry Register Ireland, or CIRI, on a statutory footing. <\/p><p>The focus will remain firmly on ensuring the full roll out of the Building Control reform agenda, to ensure that all those that engaged in the construction sector take their responsibilities seriously and are appropriately held to account.  As part of the reform agenda, consumer protection will continue to a core concern and any proposals in that regard will, of course, be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300090#WRFF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Guidelines","counter":1608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300090#WRFF03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1609,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[49808\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300090#WRFF03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when he will implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action to revise the planning regulations to remove planning restrictions on solar PV panels in order to enable increased microgeneration capacity at household, farm and small enterprise levels.","asker":"1366","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1610,"content":"<p>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a number of affordability measures to support people who wish to purchase their own homes. In particular, following a review of the previous two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, was introduced with effect from 1 February 2018. The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers  with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.<\/p>  <p>  As with previous local authority house purchase loan finance, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first time buyers only. This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300091#WRGG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Maintenance","counter":1678,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300091#WRGG04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1679,"qnumday":633,"qnumall":"[50180\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300091#WRGG04900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if additional funding will be provided for the housing voids programme in 2020; if he will reduce the local contribution demand on local authorities to source such funding in view of the constrained financial circumstances for many local authorities; his plans to ensure that adequate funding is provided to local authorities to ensure that vacant council houses are brought back to habitable standards with the minimum delay in view of the demand for social housing and long waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1680,"content":"<p>The management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, including pre-letting repairs to vacant properties, the implementation of a planned maintenance programme and carrying out of responsive repairs, are matters for each individual local authority under the Housing Acts.  <\/p>  <p>  Exchequer funding is also provided through my Department's Voids Programme to support local authorities in preparing vacant units for re-letting.

Eligibility is also generally limited to first time buyers.  The maximum discount on market value that may be given to an eligible purchaser is 40%.<\/p><p>Each housing authority was required to make a scheme of priority to set out the priority to be applied as between eligible applicants for affordable dwelling purchase arrangements.

Payments may be made by the purchaser to reduce this amount during the charged period (after the first 5 years).  The amount outstanding on the charge must be repaid in full at the end of the charged period.<\/p><p>The selling price of discounted dwellings made available for purchase by a housing authority under the affordable dwelling purchase arrangements will be influenced by a number of factors, particularly the overall cost of each particular development (taking into account inputs such as the local authority land value and Serviced Sites Fund), which can vary significantly from one site to another, the tenure mix involved and the local housing market.<\/p><p>A number of other matters require to be prescribed under Part 5 (e.g. minimum amount of payments by the purchaser during the charged period) and I intend to make these Regulations in the coming months.<\/p><p>In addition to SSF, funding of &euro;200m has also been made available under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which is also designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand.  30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities funding the balance.

Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12th March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22th March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  Both Galway City Council and Galway County Council have submitted their Scheme of Priorities to my Department which I approved on 26 June 2019 and 9 July 2019 respectively.<\/p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.<\/p><p>These schemes will complement some of the other key Government affordability initiatives, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have supported over 16,500 households nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300092#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Review","counter":1703,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300092#WRHH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1704,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[50403\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300092#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the review of the tenant purchase (incremental) scheme 2016 was completed; when he plans to publish the review; when he plans to make changes to the scheme; the reason for the delay in doing so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1705,"content":"<p>In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been recently finalised and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  I intend to bring a comprehensive package of social housing reform measures to Government in the near future and the review of the Tenant Purchase Scheme will be published as part of that process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300092#WRHH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":1707,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300092#WRHH01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation","counter":1706,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300092#WRHH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1707,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[49792\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120300092#WRHH01800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of consultations between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and a private members club (details supplied) regarding the protection of legally protected plants and habitat at a special area of conservation; if the National Parks and Wildlife Service has raised concerns in this regard; if she has been provided with a report on the matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1708,"content":"<p>As Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I have a role as a statutory consultee in a variety of legislative contexts which typically govern the making of plans and programmes, the regulation of projects and the associated environmental assessments of these (where required) across the range of development and land use sectors.
