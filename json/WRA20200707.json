Mortality coders in the Central Statistics Office (CSO) then assign an Underlying Cause Of Death (UCOD) code to each mortality record.  The UCOD is based on the medical condition(s)\/disease(s) reported on the death certificate and this is coded to the WHO International Classification of Diseases, ICD-10.  In the case of an unnatural death, the UCOD is based on the verdict of the Coroner and, in some instances, the information returned to the CSO on a Form 104 (i.e. a form completed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that attended the death scene).

There are\u00a0a number of factors which must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing\u00a0broadcasting content\u00a0quotas. The potential benefit to the Irish artistic industry must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to maximise their commercial revenue particularly in the context of the current media climate. Importantly, the introduction of broadcasting quotas would need to be consistent with EU law. <\/p>  <p>  An EU based\u00a0example of broadcasting quotas is that of airplay quotas in France. In 1994, France introduced a mandatory quota for 40% airplay of French language music on French radio stations; this quota was reduced to 35% in 2016. Any quota for airplay would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music meeting certain criteria in a more advantaged position. However, a quota for airplay of music in a particular language, as is the case in France, can be justified under EU case law, as the preservation and promotion of an official language of a Member State constitutes a general interest objective. Unlike music in a particular language, a quota system for music, drama or other artistic content\u00a0produced in a particular place, as suggested in this question, does not appear to have grounds for exemption from the general requirements of EU law. Therefore,\u00a0a quota for broadcasting\u00a0content produced in a particular Member State would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing\u00a0content produced in other Member States at a disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that traditional and contemporary Arts are among the categories set out\u00a0the Broadcasting Act, 2009\u00a0as being eligible for funding under the Sound and Vision Scheme which\u00a0is supported by 7% of\u00a0TV licence fee receipts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[13743\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the position regarding the provision of broadband for a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1456","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[13744\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the position regarding the provision of broadband for a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1456","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[14109\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a number of households just outside the reach of national broadband coverage (details supplied); the steps being taken to expedite broadband connection; and if those households within 500 metres of the existing roll out will be treated as priorities in cases in which a clear need for connection exists.","asker":"1613","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[14348\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the provision of fibre broadband supply on a road (details supplied).","asker":"1596","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 51, 62 and 70 together.<\/p><p>The Questions\u00a0refer to premises which are located in the AMBER area on the NBP High Speed Broadband Map which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.

All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. The Government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland and my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Further information on deployment activities associated with the rollout can be found on the NBI website .\u00a0I understand that some of the\u00a0premises\u00a0referred to\u00a0are close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. \u00a0eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators, as to where they build infrastructure and provide services.<\/p><p>Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. I appreciate people's\u00a0frustration\u00a0when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this commenced earlier this year. <\/p><p>To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs)\u00a0were identified by Local Authorities to be connected to high speed broadband this year. This will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main deployment under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). The planned BCP locations, including schools, library hubs, local sports facilities and other public places are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website\u00a0<i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>The BCP delivery project is well underway and connectivity is being provided to each of the sites by National Broadband Ireland (NBI). Subsequent to this, the sites, other than schools, are being Wi-Fi enabled by Vodafone under a contract with the Department of Rural and Community Development. This work also involves the local authorities and site owners\u00a0determining the services that will be provided for end-users at each site. For the 75 schools that are also part of this project, enabling these schools with Wi-Fi is being led by the Department of Education subsequent to NBI providing the connectivity to the schools.<\/p><p>Bringing connectivity to remote rural locations is central to promoting regional development and BCPs represent an important delivery in the early stages of the National Broadband Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03600"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[13750\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if a matter will be addressed in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1484","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>My Department has made enquiries with the NSSO who have confirmed that responsibility\u00a0for the matter raised in the question rests with the company concerned.My Department will liaise with the Deputy to provide further assistance and facilitate obtaining up to date information from the relevant bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD03900"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[13955\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700066#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the financial supports in place for a person to set up a solar energy farm; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1546","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS)\u00a0has been\u00a0established to support delivery\u00a0of\u00a0Ireland's 70% renewable electricity target by 2030.The RESS is\u00a0a competitive, auction-based scheme which invites renewable electricity generation projects, including solar farms,\u00a0to bid for capacity and receive a guaranteed price for the electricity they generate\u00a0for up to 16.5 years.

In light of these consultations there are currently no plans to change the criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  I would particularly emphasise to the Deputy that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces in general, thus disadvantaging those with restricted mobility who are currently eligible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700067#WRE05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aviation Industry","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[13725\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the steps being taken to liaise with the airline industry to ensure that consumers who have been unable to make scheduled flights due to the current travel restrictions are being prioritised and dealt with in a fair and just manner via airlines internal complaints and refund application facilities in view of the fact many have incurred significant personal losses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1614","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[13863\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the financial protections in place for those who have flights booked for outgoing flights to Spain while the current guidance is that no non-essential travel is to be undertaken; if persons can claim a refund under EU directives; if the travel provider has a duty to refund or voucher the cost of flights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[13953\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF00500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the result of requests made to request airlines to refund families that cannot travel even though flights may be operating.","asker":"1514","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[14281\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason airlines, such as an airline (details supplied), are permitted to continue to sell airline tickets and run flights without refunding passengers when non&ndash;essential travel is advised against; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[14586\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that airline companies are refusing to refund fares to persons who cancel their holidays abroad in line with the advice of the Government not to travel unnecessarily abroad in 2020; the action he will take to ensure persons are not at the loss of the airline fares paid in good faith, either by direct refund by the Government or by way of discussions with the airlines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":235,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 91, 97, 121 and 141 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, current Government advice to people is to avoid all non-essential travel overseas, based on the advices of our public health experts. However, there are no flight restrictions in place in Ireland, and there have not been any at any stage since the Government first responded to the threat from Covid-19.  This means that the operation of flights remains a commercial decision for airlines. People can still travel if they consider that it is essential to do so and so long as they comply with self-isolation requirements on their return.  <\/p>  <p>  As things stand in law, air passenger rights are protected by Regulation (EC) No. 261\/2004, which covers the rights of passenger in instances of cancellations.  However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.  That said, I understand that the main Irish airlines are currently allowing customers who are booked to travel over the summer months to move their flights with zero change fee.  Where flights are cancelled by the airlines, people are entitled to a full cash refund.   <\/p>  <p>  Clearly the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions across the Globe.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances, and it is something that I will be raising with the industry at the first available opportunity.   Clearly, if the industry is seeking to secure State financial support to help it through the current period - and I believe that is a likely recommendation from the Aviation Taskforce - then a commitment to fairness and clarity on consumer rights will have to be offered in return, at the very least.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF00900"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[13735\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700068#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of persons waiting for driver tests for classes (details supplied) respectively; the number of tests conducted in each of the past four weeks in each class in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

Among the measure we will prioritise is a Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, expanding the Local Link rural transport service and prioritising public transport projects that enhances regional and rural connectivity.  <\/p><p>Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and it has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis. I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times. A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network. <\/p><p>Over the course of the COVID-19 crisis, my Department has been working closely with the National Transport Authority (NTA) to ensure public transport services continue and to plan for the provision of enhanced public transport services in line with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. In this context, the NTA is engaging directly with both PSO and commercial transport operators.  <\/p><p>With the commencement of Phase 3 of the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business<\/i>on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of fleet. This will help to underpin public transport services during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business<\/i>.  Alongside this change, the wearing of a face covering when using public transport is now being made mandatory, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to young age. The legal framework to back up the mandatory use of face coverings on public transport is currently being prepared and we expect to have new Health Regulations in the coming days.<\/p><p>Further, there is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and therefore should only be used for essential travel, with only those who absolutely have to travel at peak times doing so and encouraging staggered retail and office opening hours. People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.<\/p><p>Temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, have also been approved for the licensed bus sector. Licensed operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. The support is aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The support will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The National Transport Authority (NTA), as the public transport licensing agency, will administer the support through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700069#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trans European Transport Network Programme","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700069#WRG02800"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[14133\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700069#WRG02900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the review of the Ten-T maps for Ireland with a view to including more regional development; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>In April 2019, the European Commission commenced the review of TEN-T with an evaluation of the existing TEN-T Regulation together with an open public consultation.

Works on those roads are funded from Councils' own resources supplemented by Exchequer road grants, where applicable.

The scheme is designed to maintain the key relationship between employers and employees and minimise the impact on the economy to the greatest extent possible during the public health restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the most recent statistics, for the week to 2 July 2020, 410,000 employees are currently being supported by the scheme and almost 568,000 employees have received a subsidy since commencement. In addition, the Department of Social Protection and Rural Affairs has indicated that since the start of the pandemic over 730,000 people have applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>Payments made under both the TWSS and PUP are income supports and share the characteristics of income and are subject to tax. The TWSS is also subject to USC while the PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and is exempt from that charge. Both schemes are exempt from PRSI charges. However, neither scheme is being taxed in real-time through the PAYE system, but recipients may become liable for tax and USC (for TWSS) at the end of the year, which will be calculated by Revenue through the employee End of Year Review   process.<\/p>  <p>  The level of tax and USC due by any person at year end in respect of TWSS and PUP payments may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available. Any liability due may also be further reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset. Revenue has also very recently placed all recipients of either the TWSS or the PUP on the &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of 2020 to &lsquo;preserve&rsquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any tax or USC liabilities that arise. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has also assured me that if any tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with the persons impacted upon to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period. This will be achieved by reducing their tax credits for future years, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.     <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including a person&rsquo;s civil status, the available tax credits, the actual amounts received during the year under the TWSS and PUP schemes, any top-up payments made by the employer, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses. As there are considerable differences in each person&rsquo;s tax circumstances, it is not yet possible to provide details of the estimated undercharges (if any) arising from the taxation of TWSS and PUP payments. It is also not yet possible to estimate the numbers of taxpayers who may have such undercharges as these details will not be available with any degree of accuracy until after the year end.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Deputy Doherty's point regarding payment breaks for mortgage holders, I welcomed the announcement by the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) of the introduction of the payment breaks for those affected by Covid-19 in March for 3 months and the subsequent announcement on 30 May of the extension to the payment breaks for a possible further 3 months, on a non-legislative basis. Figures released by the BPFI on 28 May stated that over 78,000 payment breaks were in place for mortgages and work is ongoing in relation to those seeking to avail of the 2nd payment break. These payment breaks have provided welcome breathing space and support for those affected by Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Bank expects lenders to clearly explain to their customers the implications of a payment break; for the term, payment schedule, and costs of the loan. The Central Bank has communicated its expectations to financial institutions that at the end of the agreed payment break, borrowers should be given the option to either (i) repay the loan within the remaining term or (ii) extend the term of the loan. This choice should apply for all loans, including mortgages, and the impact of both options on the overall cost of credit and monthly repayments should be fully explained to the customer, noting that borrower circumstances and the appropriateness of each option will differ. As part of their supervisory work, they will be monitoring compliance with this expectation and take action, where their expectations are not met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700071#WRJ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Repossessions Rate","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700071#WRJ04500"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[13847\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700071#WRJ04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of repossessions of family homes carried out by each of the main banks in each of the past five years to date; the number of multiple residence developments affected in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that within the remit of their responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers, its approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that lenders have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  <\/p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) forms part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or the terms and conditions they apply in those policies.    <\/p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  For example, in relation to motor insurance, factors may include those such as the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used, the claims record, the number of drivers, and the location of storage.  Insurers also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and do not all use the same combination of rating factors, so as a result prices vary across the market.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of motorists, such as those noted in the details supplied, who lose access to a &ldquo;no claims bonus&rdquo; because they have not been insured for a number of years, I understand that in general, this is because insurance companies set a date by which a no-claims bonus will expire, where the driver has held no insurance in their own name for two or more years.  This applies whether the person continues to reside in Ireland, or they decide to move abroad and it is primarily a commercial matter for insurance companies.  I understand from Insurance Ireland that this is because the possession of continuous insurance without making a claim is taken as positive evidence of the unlikelihood of a future claim being made &ndash; thus resulting in a discount on their premium known as a no claims bonus.  They also note that different insurers will price the increased likelihood of a claim being made in the absence of such continuous insurance in different ways and that most will refuse to apply a no claims bonus in situations where there has been no driving experience for a set number of years.  As previously mentioned, such decisions are commercial and based on their application of the rating factors noted above and also on the fact that the risk profile of such a person has changed.<\/p>  <p>The Deputy should note that during the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s work in relation to motor insurance, this issue was raised mainly in the context of returning emigrants, who may have found it difficult to secure insurance, despite having driving experience while abroad.  In this respect, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance, under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience of such drivers gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The details of it is available on Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s website and the websites of its member companies.  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated differently to any other driver, subject to verification of their continued driving experience   and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  Thus, a returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the protocol also states that if more than two years have passed since the Irish motor insurance policy was cancelled\/lapsed, the Irish No Claims Discount is no longer valid.  Notwithstanding this, if the person has been abroad for longer than two years, Insurance Ireland members have agreed through the protocol that if the person has claims-free driving experience in a different country in their own name, they will take this experience into consideration if that person seeks a quotation from an insurer, on their return to Ireland, subject to the appropriate verifiable documentation being provided. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, any motorist having difficulty in relation to this issue can contact Insurance Ireland, who operate a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700071#WRJ06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":452,"content":"<p>Question No. 160 answered with Question No. 152.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700072#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[13927\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700072#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if yoga studios currently in the VAT rate group of 13.5% can be moved into the second reduced rate of 9% in conjunction with other sporting activities and physical education activities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1555","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The ARNWP calculation is based on the number of insurable weeks within the January\/February period rather than the pay frequency used, as this is a more accurate and consistent method across all types of employees.  <\/p>  <p>  In the example referenced by the Deputy, Revenue advise me that there is no underpayment of subsidy. The individual in question was paid for two full months in January and February 2020, which includes nine insurable weeks and the ARNWP is correctly calculated by dividing the total net pay figure for the two-month period by nine. Revenue has informed me that it has reviewed the relevant payroll submissions in respect of the individual and is satisfied that the calculations are operating correctly and in accordance with the rules of the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the taxation status of payments made under the TWSS, these amounts are income supports and share the characteristics of income. Therefore, payments made under the scheme are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC), but not employee PRSI.

This means that any unused tax credits will be &lsquo;preserved&rsquo; until year end and can be offset against any tax or USC liabilities that arise. As previously advised, any additional tax credits such as health expenses may also be used to further reduce or eliminate tax liabilities arising from the payment of the TWSS. Revenue has also assured me that if any tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with persons impacted to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period. This will be achieved by reducing their tax credits for future years, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has advised me that it will make direct contact with the person to clarify any queries she may still have regarding how the TWSS entitlements are calculated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700072#WRK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budget Contribution","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700072#WRK02400"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[14142\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700072#WRK02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the concern expressed in a 2018 report from the Oireachtas Standing Committee of Public Accounts that established macroeconomic indicators have become unreliable in the Irish context and that the distorted picture they provide overstates debt sustainability and is costing the State hundreds of millions of euro each year in EU budget contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>Irish macroeconomic statistics have been heavily affected by globalisation and the activities of multinationals in recent years.

For these reasons, alternative measures of output produced by the CSO, such as modified Gross National Income (&lsquo;GNI*&rsquo;), offer a more appropriate benchmark for economic activity.<\/p>  <p>  For example, my Department uses a range of metrics to assess debt sustainability rather than solely relying on debt to GDP figures.

To date, the scheme has provided support to almost 59,000 employers in respect 568,000 employees totalling &euro;1.9 billion. Approximately 410,000 employees are currently in receipt of the subsidy. <\/p>  <p>  The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 places the administration of the TWSS under the care and management of Revenue, which includes ensuring that this very significant investment of public funds is properly allocated to eligible employers and employees. In the exercise of this important role, Revenue is conducting a programme of compliance checks on all employers availing of the scheme to confirm that they meet the eligibility criteria and crucially that employees are receiving the correct amount of subsidy due to them.<\/p>  <p>  In order to verify eligibility, Revenue is asking employers to summarise the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on their business, the basis on which they reasonably anticipated a reduction of 25% or more in their turnover in Quarter two of this year, and whether the expected level of reduction actually occurred. In order to ensure that employees are being fairly treated and TWSS funds are being paid out as intended, Revenue is also seeking a sample of payslips from each employer. It is important to note that employers are obliged to include the amount of subsidy paid on each employee&rsquo;s payslip. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s specific concerns, Revenue has assured me that it is fully aware of the difficulties that many businesses are currently experiencing due to the pandemic and will minimise any administrative burden arising from the compliance checks to the greatest extent possible, including issuing the compliance notifications on a staggered basis over the next few months. For many employers, a simple statement that due to the nature of their business, they were required to cease trading for a significant part of Quarter two is sufficient to confirm eligibility. Where any employer genuinely cannot provide the required documentation or payslip copies within the five days due to staffing shortages, working from home arrangements or any other difficulty, Revenue will provide the additional time needed if the business makes contact and advises of when the documentation will be provided. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that where a business had a reasonable basis for projecting a minimum 25% decrease in turnover, but ultimately suffered a lesser reduction in trade, it will require that employer to exit the scheme on a prospective basis rather than suffer any retrospective impact. However, where a business was clearly not eligible for the scheme or failed to pay the correct level of subsidy to its employees, or abused the scheme in any other way, there will be a requirement to repay the funds received. Any identified abuse of the TWSS will also lead to a more in-depth examination of the employer&rsquo;s overall tax position.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has advised me that it has issued just over 4,000 compliance notifications to-date and many of these employers have already provided prompt and satisfactory responses.  Some of the employers have provided commendations in relation to the speed of development of the TWSS and in respect of Revenue's role in ensuring such a vital liquidity support is being properly applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700072#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700072#WRK03300"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[14179\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700072#WRK03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if 2020 renovation expenditure on a bed and breakfast can be claimed as tax relief in 2021 (details supplied) in view of the fact there will be no income in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that renovation expenditure on a bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) could, depending on the type of expenditure involved, either be regarded as capital or revenue in nature. <\/p>  <p>  Where accommodation is provided as part of the carrying on of a B&amp;B trade, in computing the profits chargeable to tax, a deduction will be available for expenditure that is revenue in nature and which is expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the B&amp;B trade.

The Deputy should note that neither I, nor the Central Bank, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide refunds to their customers, as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I and my officials have had extensive engagement with the insurance industry over insurance cover and reliefs for businesses during the COVID-19 emergency. The outcome of this engagement is an agreement that I announced on 10 April whereby most of the key insurers in the Irish market - namely Allianz, AIG, AXA, FBD, Liberty Insurance, RSA, Travelers Insurance and Zurich - will ensure that a number of common forbearance measures are available to their business customers. It should be noted that this is a voluntary agreement, but my views are that the other major insurers in the Irish market should also sign up to this commitment.<\/p>  <p>  The common measures included in the agreement are outlined below:<\/p>  <p>  Forbearance <\/p>  <p>  Insurers will reduce premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer Liability\/ Public Liability and Commercial Motor.<\/p>  <p>  Insurers will allow up to 28 days after renewal for payment.<\/p>  <p>  Business Premises<\/p>  <p>  Insurers will maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings\/ premises not in use due to COVID-19 restriction (for a maximum of 90 days). Appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required.  <\/p>  <p>  Insurers will support requests for a change of property use during the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  While I believe that the above agreement should assist many businesses in relation to their insurance, this will only happen if insurers deliver upon their commitments.  Therefore, I asked Insurance Ireland to put in place a mechanism which provides proof of delivery.  My Department received the first &ldquo;Activity Report&rdquo; on this issue from Insurance Ireland on 25 May. This Report shows that in the period 23 March to 4 May, Insurance Ireland members processed 4,093 forbearance requests for business customers worth a total of &euro;5,242,349.  I have sought more detailed information from Insurance Ireland on the nature of the forbearance being offered, as I want to be certain that they are adhering to the spirit of the commitment they entered into, and I am awaiting that currently.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that the Central Bank has written to insurance firms setting out their expectations that insurance firms should take account of the difficult and challenging situation in which many customers find themselves. The Bank has also stated that, as a matter of urgency, firms should develop consumer-centric solutions to the handling of insurance payment breaks and policy rebates in light of the COVID-19 emergency.<\/p>  <p>  I have said on more than one occasion that insurers should treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  However, neither the Central Bank nor I have any role in adjudicating on matters such as insurance refunds or rebates. I encourage consumers to engage directly with their broker or insurer regarding forbearance measures and other reliefs.

In this context, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of mortgage applications, lenders continue to process applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The BPFI has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.   However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit, or temporarily suspend a mortgage approval in principle, is a commercial and contractual decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard. <\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  The CMCAR further provides that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.

That tax must be paid by such accountable person out of the proceeds of the disposal in priority to any debt such as a mortgage secured on the property.  <\/p>  <p>  The amount of CGT chargeable is determined by reference to the circumstances of the debtor. Accordingly, if the property disposed of was occupied by the debtor as that debtor&rsquo;s principal private residence for all or part of the debtor&rsquo;s period of ownership, full or partial relief from CGT may apply to the extent that any CGT liability arises. The last 12 months of ownership of the property by the debtor is treated as a period of occupation for this purpose. <\/p>  <p>  With respect to local property tax (LPT), under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), the person who is the liable person on the liability date for a particular year is the person who is responsible for the payment of LPT for that year. Thus, for example, the person who is the liable person on 1 November 2019 is responsible for the payment of LPT for the year 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In general, the owner of a residential property is the liable person. However, where a financial institution enforces its security over a property by taking possession of the property, the financial institution, as a &lsquo;mortgagee in possession&rsquo;, displaces the owner of the property as the liable person.  If the financial institution does not actually become a &lsquo;mortgagee in possession&rsquo;, the owner of the property continues to be the liable person.

Credit unions could further grow their consumer lending, mortgage and SME lending, expand the range of products and services they provide their members and further embed digitisation, either individually or through collaborative efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Following recent revisions to Central Bank lending regulations the sector currently has capacity to lend an additional &euro;1.1 billion for mortgage and SME lending collectively, with additional lending capacity available to credit unions which can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank.  As at end 2019 credit unions had a mortgage and SME loan book of approximately &euro;300 million.<\/p>  <p>  There are also positive examples of credit unions providing new services. To date, 53 credit unions have been approved by the Central Bank to provide current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a range of payment services to their members. This has been rolled out in approximately 35 credit unions so far.<\/p>  <p>  I and my officials will continue to engage constructively to assist credit unions in delivering new services to their members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700073#WRL05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[14597\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for a national recovery fund; if he plans to use windfall gains as identified in the programme for Government to reduce borrowing requirements; his views on whether such windfall gains would be more appropriately utilised as part of a national recovery fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>It is intended that, beginning in 2020, the Recovery Fund will be available for three years and will consist of three primary elements:<\/p>  <p>  -  Infrastructure development - focussing on areas such as housing, retrofitting and transport to maintain employment and lay the foundation for future employment. <\/p>  <p>  -  Reskilling and retraining - for those who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic and are unable to return to their previous employment, so that they can receive the skills they need to attain new opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  -  Support investment - measures to help Irish companies access credit and capital to support the retention and creation of jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Measures such as these will have a significant fiscal cost and will be additional to the cost of the wide range of measures introduced to-date. As a consequence of this support, as well as the fall-off in taxation receipts, the general government deficit is expected to be in the region of &euro;23-&euro;30 billion this year. As I have said previously, it is entirely appropriate that Government runs a deficit and increases borrowing to support the economy in these unprecedented circumstances. However, borrowing at this scale cannot go on indefinitely and once circumstances allow, we must return the public finances to a sustainable path. <\/p>  <p>a  As the Programme for Government sets out, windfall gains - such as they may arise - will be used to reduce the overall level of borrowing. For example, the first tranche of the NAMA surplus, some &euro;2 billion, was returned to the Exchequer last month. The NAMA transfer means that we will borrow &euro;2 billion less this year than would otherwise be the case. Similar transfers, such as the proceeds from the liquidation of the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation or the sale of the state shareholdings in the banks, will also be used to reduce our borrowing requirements. Given the likelihood of continued fiscal deficits over the medium-term, and the level of our existing stock of debt, such an approach is the most effective strategy for use of such receipts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":570,"content":"<p>Question No. 202 answered with Question No. 197.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[14599\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to focus tax rises on behavioural taxes with negative externalities such as carbon tax, sugar tax and plastics as outlined in the programme for Government; his views on whether the cited behavioural taxes are not a sustainable source of revenue in view of the fact the stated objective of the tax is to reduce consumption of the good producing the negative externality; his further views on whether these taxation measures match the broader aim to achieve a sustainable tax environment as outlined in the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government sets out the Government&rsquo;s intention to utilise taxation measures, as well as expenditure measures, to close the deficit and fund public services, if required.

Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is charged at 33%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts; and the Local Property Tax (LPT), which was introduced in 2013, is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.

A number of measures have been taken in this regard in recent years and include the introduction of the Universal Social Charge, the Local Property Tax and the Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax. More recently changes to the VAT rate and carbon tax changes were introduced to broaden the tax base and to counteract the effect of negative externalities. In addition, I have also taken steps to broaden and enhance the stability of our corporation tax base, including through the introduction of the 80 per cent cap on capital allowances for intangible assets in Budget 2018 and the introduction of a broader Exit Tax regime in Budget 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that we need to remain cognisant of avoiding the mistakes of the past and being overly reliant on a narrow set of taxes.

Further strengthened in subsequent years, the CCMA, and within it, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), is just one part of the national policy framework of supports and protections to assist people with mortgage arrears difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989, which gives the Central Bank the power to draw up, amend or revoke codes of practice and such codes must be complied with by regulated entities. The provisions of the CCMA are legally binding on regulated entities, and the Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions on regulated entities for a contravention of the CCMA under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of this statutory Code is to ensure that regulated entities have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  Due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations.<\/p>  <p>  An alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) is a contract that is entered into between the regulated entity and the borrower, and the process for arriving at the ARA is stipulated in the CCMA. Provision 39 of the CCMA requires that in order to determine which options for ARAs are viable for each particular case, a regulated entity must explore all of the options for ARAs offered by that regulated entity. A non-exhaustive list of ARA options which may be included in a regulated entity&rsquo;s suite is set out within this provision. It is a commercial decision for each regulated entity to determine the suite of ARAs it considers putting in place for borrowers. Any ARA offered to a borrower must be appropriate and sustainable for his\/her individual circumstances. The Central Bank cannot interfere in the contractual rights between regulated entities and borrowers such that it could require a regulated entity to consider or put in place specific ARAs for borrowers.<\/p>  <p>  Rather, in regulating conduct of business, the Central Bank seeks to ensure that regulated entities comply with relevant conduct of business rules, including providing consumers with all relevant information, putting in place a process for the management of customers&rsquo; financial difficulties and not exerting undue pressure or influences on customers.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA also requires regulated entities to have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower appeal a decision by a regulated entity, including where the borrower is not willing to enter into an ARA or where the regulated entity declines to offer an ARA. The appeals procedure must inform the borrower of his\/her right to refer the matter to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  The protection of borrowers in mortgage arrears continues to be a key priority for the Government and the Central Bank. The consumer protection framework provides a significant number of protections and supports for borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, in recognition of the distress and, in the case of mortgages secured on a borrower&rsquo;s primary residence, the vulnerability of borrowers at risk of losing their home.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Programme for Government, my Department is committed to assessing the CCMA, including the available suite of alternative repayment arrangements, and ensuring that it has full legal effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[14613\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the timeline for the introduction of the senior executive accountability regime to deliver heightened accountability with the banking system as outlined in the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government has committed to introduce a Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR).

Therefore, in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future - this new Government commits itself to make every effort to get people back to work, to re-open businesses while developing the strategies and the policies to drive this forward.  The first major step in this will be the development of an economic and jobs initiative to be published this month.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Programme for Government also contains a further range of measures which are designed to renew economic activity, including measures which will encourage and support the provision of credit to businesses and households.  To that end, my Department will continue to maintain close contact with the Central Bank and the banking industry, through the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) as the industry's representative body, as the lending industry works to address the difficulties the Covid-19 situation is causing for both borrowers and lenders and as it seeks to support the regeneration of the economy.  Measures which will support new lending to businesses, such as the proposed new Credit Guarantee Scheme, will be very important in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  It will also be important, consistent with the need to protect financial stability and to ensure that banks lend on a prudent and sustainable basis, to try ensure that the level of interest charged on loans will be competitive and economic for both borrowers and lenders.  However, it will be important to recognise that there are many factors which influence and determine the level of interest charged on mortgages, business and other loans.  These include the fact that the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks, funding costs, capital requirements (which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience) and operating costs. Structural factors also play a role, including the duration of fixation of interest rates, the offering of cashback and other incentives in the Irish market, and the mix of deposit and non-deposit funding, which can bring interest rate risk when lending over long durations. In this regard, it should be borne in mind that the under-pricing of credit risks by Irish banks would itself bring financial stability concerns in the event of widespread default events following an economic shock, suggesting that calls for further interest rate reductions for borrowers must be carefully weighed up against such systemic risk concerns.<\/p>  <p>  While interest rates in Ireland remain higher than in many other European countries, it should nevertheless also be noted that there has been significant reduction in interest rates on new mortgage lending over the last few years. For example, the new business interest rate, excluding negotiations, on mortgage loans with fixations over one year, was 4.02% at Jan 2015 and is now 2.70%. These are significant reductions that benefit borrowers greatly over loan lifetimes. Many borrowers currently paying more on their mortgages could benefit from switching onto these lower new business rates.<\/p>  <p>  It is nevertheless the case that the interest rates charged by lenders for their mortgage, business and other loans (and indeed also the decisions they make on the interest they pay for their deposits and other funds) are ultimately commercial matters for individual lenders having regard to cost and competitive considerations, and neither the Central Bank of Ireland, nor I as Minister for Finance, has the power to prescribe the lending interest rates charged banks or other commercial lenders; and neither is it appropriate that I should have such a power.  However, I will continue to work with the Central Bank as regulator, and with the banking industry to see if any there are further regulatory or other appropriate measures can be deployed to, in a sustainable way, further support the credit environment for business and personal borrowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM04500"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[14615\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review the motor taxation regime to ensure that it adequately captures the harm caused by nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide emissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":610,"content":"<p>Programme for Government measures such as this are being considered by my officials in the context of the upcoming Budget and future Budgets. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM04800"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[14616\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700074#WRM04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to increase and hypothecate all additional carbon tax revenue as outlined in the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":613,"content":"<p>As stated in the Programme for Government, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to increase the carbon tax to 100 euro per tonne by 2030.

Initially focusing on housing, education and health, a set of indicators will be developed to create a broader context for policy-making, to include a balanced scorecard for each area of public policy, focused on outcomes and the impact that those policies have on individuals and communities. The overriding focus is to improve the wellbeing of the Irish people and society. <\/p>  <p>  The development of this work will be informed by the experience of other jurisdictions which have developed similar measures in recent years. Through the Department of the Taoiseach, a group of experts will be convened from the public service, academia, NGOs, and the private sector to guide this work.    <\/p>  <p>  Once developed, Government will ensure that it is utilised in a systematic way across government policy-making at local and national levels, in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress. This will be an important complement to existing economic measurement tools that are in place to support well-being and outcomes-based approaches to policy making.<\/p>  <p>  This includes the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH Model which will continue to be utilised to help Government understand the impact of proposed reforms on households. Moreover, initiatives such as the Spending Review process, which is a key platform for evidence informed policy making across the Civil Service, will continue to produce evidence relevant to the wellbeing and outcomes of people, households, businesses and sectors of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Through my Department's responsibility for Performance and Equality budgeting, work is already underway in examining developments in this area, particularly regarding international best practice. Leveraging the experience in identifying metrics which maximise transparency and accountability, and utilising the guidance we provide to line departments in identifying the most appropriate measures to scrutinise public expenditure, I envisage that my Department will play a key role in working with the Department of the Taoiseach in delivering this work.   <\/p>  <p>  In terms of budgeting for demographic related costs, this is an issue that is under constant review in my Department. An updated version of the paper &lsquo;Budgetary Impacts of Changing Demographics 2020 - 2030&rsquo; was published by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service alongside Budget 2020. A number of policy areas of particular relevance to demographics are covered in this paper, including pensions, child benefit, education provision and health schemes such as the Nursing Home Support Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  This most recent version of the paper suggests demographic pressures of approximately &euro;0.5 billion annually across Health, Social Protection and Education over most of the period to 2030. The analysis in this paper is based on an examination of sectoral expenditure data and CSO population estimates for the period, using the M2F2 projection scenario. These estimates form a central part of Estimates discussions with the relevant Ministers and Departments and are subject to ongoing evaluation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700076#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Process","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700076#WRQ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[14626\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700076#WRQ04900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to incorporate national satellite accounts into the budgetary process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>By national satellite accounts I understand the Deputy to mean statistics that cover activities linked to the domestic economy but not part of the core national accounts.

The range of policies is broad and can include disability access, training for young or disadvantaged people, SME access as well as green public procurement and environmental sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP has been actively engaged and proactive on this issue. The OGP published Circular 20\/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement in October 2019. The circular highlights the potential for Departments to deliver wider social and environmental aims through public procurement including in relation to employment and training opportunities for disadvantaged groups, disability access, promoting social inclusion and social enterprises. The circular, a commitment under the Climate Action Plan, provided a clear signal of the direction of travel.  Green public procurement (GPP) is about leveraging the State&rsquo;s purchasing power to choose more environmentally friendly goods, services and works and help contribute to more sustainable consumption and production.<\/p>  <p>  The Circular was the latest in a series of measures following publication of the Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement in December 2018.  The Information Note assists policy makers and practitioners in understanding how public procurement can be used to facilitate the advancement of existing social policy objectives as well as the wider context and implications of including them in particular public procurement projects.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP also established the cross Departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group in March 2019, bringing together officials from policy Departments with procurement practitioners to share best practice and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement. In addition to the work of the Social Considerations Advisory Group, the OGP has also engaged in bilateral meetings with Government Departments and promotes strategic procurement at procurement related events aimed at public sector bodies as well as for suppliers and social enterprises across the country.  The OGP works with Government Departments when it is putting new central arrangements in place to ensure that appropriate regard is taken for sustainability criteria.<\/p>  <p>  These developments promote and facilitate the inclusion of social considerations in a structured manner and are aimed at helping policy makers and procurement practitioners understand how procurement can be used to support advancement of existing social policy objectives, the wider context and the implications of including them in procurement projects.<\/p>  <p>  I, along with my colleagues in Government, will be considering how best to implement the commitments in the Programme for Government.  Minister of State Smyth and I have met with the Chief Procurement Officer and will be having further discussions with the OGP in this regard, building on the progress to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700076#WRQ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Question Heading for question(s)  242","counter":675,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700076#WRQ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":676,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[14629\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700076#WRQ05700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to introduce a bargaining clause in the new agreement to make progress on sectoral issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[14630\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700076#WRQ05800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to negotiate a new public pay deal with the public service unions; his further plans to ensure that there is an emphasis on embedding positive work practice changes that have emerged from the Covid-19 emergency and general productivity gains and effectiveness based on measurable outcomes; if he plans to ensure public servants are adequately compensated for the outcomes of these measurable productivity gains; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":678,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 243 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the current public service pay agreement - the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 - runs to the end of the year. <\/p><p>Within the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to negotiate a new agreement with the public service unions which would take account of, inter alia, the State's financial position and outlook and that could include a mechanism to make progress on sectoral issues.  <\/p><p>I will give full consideration to all of these issues over the coming weeks and arrangements will be made for discussions with relevant staff interests at the appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700076#WRQ05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":680,"content":"<p>Question No. 244 answered with Question No. 235.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700077#WRR00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Control","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700077#WRR00400"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[14316\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700077#WRR00500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if the impact of urban seagull colonies on communities will be reviewed; if so, if recommendations will be made; if the details including notes of the briefing to her predecessor in respect of reports (details supplied) by community representatives will be provided with regard to the consultative committee established.","asker":"1563","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>My Department is aware of the impact of gull species especially in coastal urban areas.<\/p><p>The State Wide Declaration for the period up to 30 April 2021 allows the killing and capturing of certain wild bird species where they are causing damage to crops, livestock and fauna or represent a threat to public health or safety.The Declaration is published on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at <i>www.npws.ie\/legislation\/irish-law\/eu-birds-directive-derogations<\/i>.

No. 477\/2011), both of which prohibit activities to introduce or spread invasive species. In addition to national legislation, the EU IAS Regulation (1143\/2014) also provides for a range of concerted EU wide measures to be taken with respect to listed species of Union concern (the 'Union list'). The grey squirrel, introduced to Ireland just over 100 years ago, is listed as an invasive alien species of national concern on the Third Schedule of the Birds and Natural Habitats Regulations and is also included on the Union list.<\/p><p>NPWS is working in conjunction with a range of agencies, including  local authorities as well as with colleagues in the EU, and the UK, to manage the risks associated with Invasive Alien Species. New legislation around invasive alien species, including provisions to fully implement aspects of the EU IAS Regulation, has been drafted by the NPWS and is currently being finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. This legislation will update and strengthen existing legislation and provide appropriate powers to deal effectively with invasive alien species in the State.<\/p><p>The most effective control of the grey squirrel appears to have occurred through the spread of pine martens in recent years.  The Grey Squirrel had become numerous in  most of the eastern half of the island of Ireland. It competes with the Red Squirrel for resources, and carries a disease that is fatal to the native Red. The spread of Grey Squirrel was  mirrored by a retraction in Red Squirrel range and a reduction in numbers.<\/p><p>In recent surveys of the two squirrel species it became apparent that the Grey Squirrel had disappeared from parts of the midlands. This disappearance was linked to the re-emergence of the Pine Marten, a native carnivore. It had previously almost disappeared but has made a considerable recovery after it was protected under Irish law. High densities of Pine Marten were found in the midlands of Ireland, in the areas where Grey Squirrel had disappeared. Meanwhile, Red Squirrel has made a recovery in some of these areas and seems capable of co-habiting woodlands with the Pine Marten. Similar findings have since been made in Scotland.<\/p><p>A full report on a recent  survey of the three species was published by the NPWS as Irish Wildlife Manual no. 121 and can be found at  <i>www.npws.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/pdf\/IWM121.pdf<\/i>.<\/p><p>I am advised that the policy of the Department of Agriculture and the Marine is that pest and mammal control is a matter for landowners.

Creative Ireland is a culture-based programme led by my Department and designed to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.<\/p>  <p>  Under Pillar 2 of the Programme &ndash; 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community  ' &ndash; each local authority has published a 5-year Culture and Creativity Strategy, as well as establishing a Culture Team led by a Creative Ireland Coordinator to oversee its implementation.  My Department, together with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government have, over the course of 2018 and 2019, allocated total funding of &euro;6.549 million to all 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual strategies through extensive programmes of activities, events and initiatives.  The same level of core funding which was provided last year (&euro;3 million) is also being made available to local authorities in 2020 to enable them to continue the implementation of their strategies.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2018 each local authority has also been provided with additional funding by my Department to support the delivery of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g &ndash; the national day of free creative activities for children and young people under 18 years of age. The funding provided over the course of 2018 and 2019 to support Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g activities amounted to a total of &euro;1.406 million, while for 2020, a sum of &euro;15,000 has been allocated to each local authority with the four Dublin local authorities awarded &euro;75,000 each. As the Deputy will be aware, in response to the public health restrictions in place, on June 13 last Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2020 was delivered online, and each local authority contributed to making it a huge success.<\/p>  <p>  The matter of funding measures under the Creative Ireland Programme for 2021 and 2022 will be agreed in the context of Programme priorities for those years and, as the Deputy will appreciate, are subject to annual budgetary and estimates processes. However, in the recently agreed Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future   &ndash; the Government parties have committed to fostering further collaboration between local authorities and local arts organisations through the Creative Communities Pillar of the Creative Ireland Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of their key role in supporting and funding the arts at local level, local authorities have long been key strategic partners of the Arts Council &ndash; evidenced by the publication of &ldquo;A Framework for Collaboration  &rdquo;, a 10-year strategy between the Arts Council and the County and City Management Association (CCMA), which reflects on the value of the partnership to date and sets out a vision and broad goals to be progressed for the period 2016 to 2025.  The Arts Council also provides funding to local authorities, supporting the programmes of Arts Offices in each local authority, as well funding a range of other initiatives, events and festivals which are carried out in partnership with local authorities and artists in every local authority area.<\/p>  <p>  The question of funding provided by the Arts Council to support local authority arts programmes will be the subject of the annual budgetary process, as well as the Council&rsquo;s own internal procedures for the allocation of its annual budget. <\/p>  <p>Finally, recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of arts centres, many of which were initiated and funded by local authorities and supported through capital schemes largely operated by my Department. Support provided to these arts centres by local authorities is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Capital funding schemes operated by my Department continue to be focused on enhancing this existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country.  Recent capital schemes are being informed by the strategic Review of Arts Centres and Venues commissioned by the Arts Council and CCMA, as well as the Arts Council's published Arts Centre Policy and Strategy 2019   which sets out its funding criteria for arts centres from 2020 onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700077#WRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks and Wildlife Service","counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700077#WRR01600"},{"type":"question","counter":694,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[14574\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700077#WRR01700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the obligations of the NPWS on proposed natural heritage areas.","asker":"1525","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":695,"content":"<p>Section 16(1) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 provides that where a Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is of the opinion that a site should be designated as a natural heritage area, he or she shall publish or cause to be published a notice of his or her intention to make an order designating the site as a natural heritage area.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. <\/p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner \/ co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p><p>The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.<\/p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his\/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.<\/p><p>My Department publishes information on the sale of local authority houses each year.

Implementation of these recommendations, in consultation with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others, has seen a number of reforms being implemented, which include the administration of the technical assessment process on a cyclical basis where briefing, guidance and support for candidates can be administered in a structured manner; mentoring and supporting applicants; facilitating assessment based on recent projects; facilitating applicants with reassessment\/reapplication (i.e. ensuring that the technical assessment procedure is not seen as a one chance only route to registration); and reviewing and simplifying guidance materials with direct input from practice-trained persons. My Department and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others in this manner to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements of registration arrangements can be made in the context of the Fennell report or otherwise.<\/p><p>In addition to the transitional &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provision set out above, section 14(2)(f) of the Act provides a permanent route to registration for practically trained persons who have 7 years appropriate practical experience and who have passed the prescribed register examination. In 2016, the Architects Alliance of Ireland proposed a special entry route to incorporate the proposed development of a second prescribed register admission examination as currently provided for under this section.  Assessment for registration under section 14(2)(f) comes within the responsibility of the RIAI, who are designated as the registration body for the purposes of the 2007 Act, and as the competent authority for the purposes of the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications (as amended). For this reason, the Architects Alliance of Ireland were advised by my Department to discuss their proposal, in the first instance, with the RIAI as registration body and competent authority for the architectural profession in Ireland.<\/p><p>My Department and the RIAI, as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and all other stakeholders to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements in registration arrangements can be made. I would encourage all practically trained persons to pursue the routes to registration which are open to them and to continue to engage constructively with my Department and the RIAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700079#WRT04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Circulars","counter":831,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700079#WRT04200"},{"type":"question","counter":832,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[14260\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700079#WRT04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a circular has been drafted by his Department and is to be issued to local authorities imposing a blanket ban on the drawdown of Rebuilding Ireland home loans in circumstances in which the applicant with approval in principal is in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy scheme.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":833,"content":"<p>All local authorities are receiving and processing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL) applications, and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic.  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 situation has had an unprecedented economic impact and unfortunately some applicants for the RIHL have been affected. In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application\/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  On 6 July my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. There is no blanket ban. In general,  persons currently on the TWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS 19 Income.   This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan and will enable them to commence the property search. Where such applicants are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until the applicants' unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants in advance of this three-month period, where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.<\/p>  <p>  For applicants whose post-TWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.<\/p>  <p>  This approach is in line with the need to lend on a prudent basis, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment and it would not be appropriate to lend when there is a risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700079#WRT04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies Board","counter":834,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700079#WRT04500"},{"type":"question","counter":835,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[14323\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700079#WRT04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the Residential Tenancies Board will be allowed to recruit more adjudicators; the number of adjudicators that will be recruited in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":836,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Acts  2004-2019 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.

NPF Policy NPO19 is intended to tie in with the generally established Guidelines approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, under National Policy Objective 18b of the NPF, my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits to support the take-up of Irish Water&rsquo;s Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, which will provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements, which would not otherwise be provided for in Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plan and to ensure that the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund supports the development of such projects.<\/p><p>Both the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and its urban counterpart (URDF) &ndash; with a total of &euro;3 billion available between both funds to 2027 &ndash; are supporting new ideas and new initiatives to renew rural villages, as well as towns and cities.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting national policy, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters, providing capital funding for priority infrastructure projects and overseeing and administering a central national training programme.<\/p>  <p>  A Fire Safety Task Force was established by my Department in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy. The Report of the Task Force, published in May 2018, highlights that in most buildings and circumstances the safest approach and the default option for all occupants of the building is to evacuate in the event of fire or alarm.  Individual buildings should have fire safety strategies involving the in-built passive features, active fire protection systems (such as fire detection &amp;amp; alarm, and emergency lighting), and a complete building management approach, including management of fire safety to prevent fires occurring in the first place and maintenance of the building and its fire protection systems.  In houses, flats and apartments, residents have a large part to play in prevention of fires, in particular through care with ignition sources.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, as part of the Fire Safety Task Force Review, local authorities were asked by my Department to assess multi-storey, multi-unit social housings&rsquo; fire detection and alarm systems, emergency lighting systems and common escape routes, including corridors, stairways and emergency exits, and to ensure that such systems are in place and fully functional. The presence of fire detection and alarm systems was confirmed in 94% of these buildings with common escape routes. The presence of emergency lighting systems in common escape routes was confirmed in 93% of buildings, while 98% of buildings had unobstructed access\/egress at the time of inspection.  In those cases where deficiencies were found, housing authorities were requested to carry out repairs or remedial works as soon as practicable.<\/p>  <p>  The design and construction of buildings, including standards of fire safety, is regulated under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014. The Acts provide for the making of Building Regulations and Building Control Regulations. One of the primary purposes for which the Building Regulations may be made is the health, safety and welfare of persons in and around buildings. <\/p>  <p>  The Second Schedule of the Building Regulations 1997- 2017, sets out the statutory minimum performance requirements for the construction of new buildings (including dwellings) and extensions to existing buildings, as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings. Part B of the Second Schedule of the Building Control Regulations and Technical Guidance Document B (of 2017 for dwelling houses, and of 2006 (reprint 2020) for other buildings) deal with fire safety &ndash; including provisions in respect of materials used in building construction.<\/p>  <p>  The number of fire fatalities in buildings in Ireland has shown a welcome downward trend for a number of years.  Provision of a working smoke alarm is the most important step people can take, to enhance fire safety in the home.  My Department continues to emphasise this in its &ldquo;STOP Fire&rdquo; campaign which outlines that &ldquo;Together we can STOP fire:  Smoke alarms &ndash; Test alarms weekly &ndash; Obvious dangers &ndash; Plan your escape.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The focus in Building Regulations is on protection of people rather than property, although fire safety measures designed to protect life may also have the benefit of protecting property. The Schedule of Building Regulations is comprised of twelve distinct parts, classified Parts A to M, each of which sets functional requirements for buildings or works e.g. structure, fire safety, energy conservation, accessibility etc. My Department publishes Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) in relation to each of the twelve parts. These guidance documents set out how the legal requirements can be achieved in practice.<\/p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations, including fire safety, rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.  Auditing and enforcement of the provisions of the Fire Services Act and Building Regulations is a function of the 31 local authorities, who have a suite of enabling and enforcement powers under both legislative codes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":858,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU01200"},{"type":"question","counter":859,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[14374\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the price paid per Part V unit in Dublin and each other county, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":860,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[14375\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the price paid for non-Part V social housing acquisitions in Dublin and each other county, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":861,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 and 311 together.<\/p><p>Cost information on local authority and approved housing body direct construction and turnkeys, is collated by my Department at development level rather than at granular individual housing unit level.

To this end, since taking up office, I am working within my Department and with all relevant stakeholders and delivery partners to ensure that new affordable homes are delivered, particularly in Dublin and other major urban areas, where people and families are facing the greatest housing access and affordability challenge.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of affordable purchase, it is my intention that the new Scheme is finalised without delay and that the programme to build new affordable homes is accelerated and expanded. It is difficult to be definitive regarding the final purchase price of affordable homes at this point but I have clearly signalled to officials working on the Scheme in my department that the new homes must be affordable for the individuals and families that badly need them.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, a significant amount of the foundations are already in place. For example, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on local authority lands.  A maximum SSF funding amount of &euro;50,000 is available per home. This sum comprises &euro;44,500 (or 89%) Exchequer contribution and a &euro;5,500 (or 11%) local authority contribution.  On this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  This funding is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated that a requirement exists for more affordable housing and it is viable to deliver such housing from their sites.<\/p>  <p>  To date, SSF funding of &euro;127 million has been allocated in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas.  This will provide for infrastructure works that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.  The selling price of homes that will be made available for purchase under the affordable dwelling purchase arrangements will obviously be influenced by a number of factors which will vary significantly from development to development. This includes the overall development cost of each particular development, the housing type\/tenure mix involved and the local housing market.  The majority of the projects approved for funding under the SSF are at the planning and design stage. As such, the final sales prices will not be fully determined until planning permission has been obtained and after the procurement process for construction of the development in question has been completed.<\/p>  <p>  The most advanced, SSF funded, affordable housing project is at Boherboy Road in Cork City. The   construction has commenced on the project, which includes 116 brand new energy efficient, 2 and 3 bedroom homes.  The Council has confirmed these homes are expected to be made available to first time buyers at purchase prices ranging from c.&euro;198,000 to &euro;223,000.  Under the terms of the Scheme encompassed in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009, a charge would be placed on the property equal to the percentage discount given from the open market value at the time of sale, with the housing authority taking a repayable equity stake in the property.  In case of a 2-bed unit in the Boherboy development, sold to a purchaser for &euro;198,000, if the open market value of that home is, for example, &euro;230,000, a local authority equity charge of 13.9% would be placed on the property.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the range of existing measures, the Programme for Government makes clear, that the target for this Government will be to bring forward a range of measures to enable home ownership for more people through increased supply and interventions that make home to make home ownership more affordable.  In particular, the Programme commits to the progression of a State-backed affordable home purchase scheme, which is a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invasive Plant Species","counter":869,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU02500"},{"type":"question","counter":870,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[14389\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if funding will be made available to Clare County Council to eradicate an extensive spread of Japanese knotweed on public lands in Kilkee, County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":871,"content":"<p>Pending the formal transfer of heritage functions in accordance with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement on the appointment of Ministers, my Department currently has no function in relation to invasive alien species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Protection Enforcement","counter":872,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU02800"},{"type":"question","counter":873,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[14395\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of tree preservation orders issued by the four Dublin local authorities in each of the years 2015 to 2019, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":874,"content":"<p>The specific information requested in relation to tree preservation orders is no longer collated by my Department.

This recognises that renters in Dublin and other major urban centres are facing significant housing access and affordability challenges. Cost Rental is a fundamentally different housing proposal and represents a new tenure option. It is defined as housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only.  Cost Rental is not intended to overlap with or replace traditional social housing for low-income households.  In developing this model, we are informed by international experience of the delivery of cost rental, such as the &lsquo;Vienna Model&rsquo;.  At the core of this work is the development of a new long-term and sustainable form of rental properties for tenants and a sustainable model for the financing, construction and management of homes. <\/p>  <p>  Initial work on Cost Rental is underway and in 2019 an inter-departmental multi-agency Cost Rental Working Group was convened in order to assess methods for the consistent and sustainable delivery Cost Rental at scale. The Group brings together representatives of relevant government departments, State agencies, and local government. The Group is evaluating potential funding models, including the use of public land and appropriate Exchequer inputs.  The Group is also considering operational matters such as tenant eligibility.<\/p>  <p>  This work will be assisted by a recently initiated research consultancy sponsored by the European Investment Bank on behalf of my Department. The EIB has extensive experience in supporting the delivery of affordable housing across Europe. The final Report is scheduled for completion in December.<\/p>  <p>  Rents for Cost Rental homes, depend upon the overall cost of each individual development, and will vary according to the site and design specifics. However, value engineering with long-term maintenance in mind can put downward pressure on costs and help to make Cost Rental more affordable for tenants. If construction is to be funded by borrowing, it is crucial that Cost Rental providers obtain low-cost, stable finance that is repaid over a long period of time.<\/p>  <p>  The first Cost Rental pilot development at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, is being undertaken by the Tuath and Respond Approved Housing Bodies, with the assistance of DLR County Council. The mixed-tenure development comprises 50 Cost Rental homes alongside 105 social housing homes. The Cost Rental homes at this site are supported by zero-cost land supplied by the Housing Agency, an infrastructure grant from my Department's Serviced Site Fund and debt financing from the Housing Finance Agency.  Construction began on the site in July 2019 with delivery scheduled for Q3 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The other proposed Cost Rental development referred to by the Deputy, at Shanganagh Castle, is currently in the initial planning stage with D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council working in partnership with the Land Development Agency.  This is utilising Council-owned land and Shanganagh is proposed as a mixed-tenure development. It is envisaged that approximately 300 Cost Rental homes will be constructed, alongside approximately 200 social housing homes and 100 homes for sale under the Affordable Purchase scheme. A planning proposal for this site was lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in January 2020. While the final cost of rents will vary according to the ultimate cost of provision of the homes they are expected to be significantly lower than open market rates for the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700080#WRU05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":899,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[14551\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700081#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to provide the funds and work with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and or an approved housing body to purchase an apartment block (details supplied) in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in which ten apartments have been empty for three years and the other apartments that have tenants were served with eviction notices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":900,"content":"<p>Delivering social housing is a major priority for this Government as evidenced by the commitments made in the Programme for Government \"Our Shared Future\".

Creative Ireland is a culture-based programme led by my Department and designed to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.<\/p>  <p>  Under Pillar 2 of the Programme &ndash; 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community  ' &ndash; each local authority has published a 5-year Culture and Creativity Strategy, as well as establishing a Culture Team led by a Creative Ireland Coordinator to oversee its implementation.  My Department, together with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government have, over the course of 2018 and 2019, allocated total funding of &euro;6.549 million to all 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual strategies through extensive programmes of activities, events and initiatives.  The same level of core funding which was provided last year (&euro;3 million) is also being made available to local authorities in 2020 to enable them to continue the implementation of their strategies.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2018 each local authority has also been provided with additional funding by my Department to support the delivery of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g &ndash; the national day of free creative activities for children and young people under 18 years of age. The funding provided over the course of 2018 and 2019 to support Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g activities amounted to a total of &euro;1.406 million, while for 2020, a sum of &euro;15,000 has been allocated to each local authority with the four Dublin local authorities awarded &euro;75,000 each. As the Deputy will be aware, in response to the public health restrictions in place, on June 13 last Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2020 was delivered online, and each local authority contributed to making it a huge success.<\/p>  <p>  The matter of funding measures under the Creative Ireland Programme for 2021 and 2022 will be agreed in the context of Programme priorities for those years and, as the Deputy will appreciate, are subject to annual budgetary and estimates processes.

During the pandemic, the conflicts have increased in the aforementioned areas as well as in a number of other locations.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the international community is addressing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on conflict and welcome the recent United Nations Security Council Resolution on that issue. I would like to reiterate the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s call for humanitarian ceasefires during the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has supported peace-building in Colombia since discussions took place in Havana leading to the peace agreement and we will continue to do so. We have been clear, in all our discussions with the Colombian Government, that an integral implementation of the agreement will be most effective in stabilising these post-conflict areas where violence persists. This includes the regular convening of the National Commission for Security Guarantees and a more holistic view of how to ensure the security of local communities.  We have also emphasized to the Colombian Government the importance of increasing the presence of the State in these areas to ensure access to basic services and to build communities&rsquo; confidence in the ability of the State to protect them.<\/p>  <p>  The effects of this ongoing violence on local populations are unacceptable, with increases in displacement and the killing of leaders and human rights defenders. Our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; is continuing to work closely with other members of the international community to convey our concerns to the Colombian Government and to work with them to strengthen implementation of the peace agreement. We believe that providing services to post-conflict communities, in particular through building local economies to provide alternatives to membership of armed groups, alongside crop substitution programmes to reduce drug production, should form part of this holistic response.<\/p>  <p>  The Embassy has participated in monitoring visits to areas of concern, including a visit to Choc&oacute; in 2019, and works with its partner, Peace Brigades International, to follow developments in terms of Human Rights and to offer support to Human Rights Defenders. In addition to monitoring the situation, Ireland has contributed to the implementation of the peace agreement by financing both the European Union Trust Fund and the United Nations Multi-Partner Trust Fund, which work with Government on implementation projects. We also support civil society organisations through our grant to Christian Aid and aim to strengthen human rights in Colombia through support to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) office in the country. Ireland has contributed over &euro;14 million in support of the Colombian peace process since 2007.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the ruling which grants the Rio Atrato, which flows through Choc&oacute; to the gulf of Uraba, a form of legal personality in order to strengthen the environmental protection of the area. Ireland is not directly supporting the implementation of the environmental action plan for Choc&oacute; but, as a member of the European Union, contributes to a number of environmental projects. In 2019, 26 projects for over &euro;68 million were either in implementation or about to start. A previous project on sustainable fishing in the Atrato region was successfully concluded and a new forestry project is being considered. Our Embassy will continue to work with the EU delegation in country to ensure that supports to environmental projects, including the regional action plans, are developed and implemented.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers regarding the collection of information on civil society organisations, human rights defenders, journalists and other groups in Colombia. Our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has been monitoring the situation since reports came to light in January. Last month, Ambassador Milton participated in an EU Heads of Mission meeting with the Minister of Defence, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, where he outlined the Government&rsquo;s response. President Duque has been clear that he is taking a zero tolerance response to the illegal collation of secret files.  An internal investigation, started in December, is ongoing and the Ministry of Defence is sharing information with the Attorney General and Inspector General.  A number of resignations from the Armed Forces, linked to the events, have taken place. The Embassy will continue to follow the situation closely, working with civil society partners, and will consider any requests for assistance including proposals for the involvement of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and OHCHR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700082#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":964,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 351 and 352 answered with Question No. 331.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Responsibilities","counter":965,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700082#WRW01900"},{"type":"question","counter":966,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[14526\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700082#WRW02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will publish the departmental briefing paper on his role, remits and powers afforded to him upon appointment to the Cabinet.","asker":"1514","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":967,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be arranging for the publication of briefing material, in accordance with the usual procedures, provided to me as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon my appointment to the Cabinet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700082#WRW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":969,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700082#WRW02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700082#WRW02200"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[14027\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700082#WRW02300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the costings carried out on the programme for Government; and if he will provide documents on those costings.","asker":"1514","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":970,"content":"<p>The recently agreed Programme for Government contains a range of actions concerning the defence sector that will be implemented over the lifetime of the Programme.

This is necessary to ensure fairness to all students.  <\/p>  <p> The Calculated Grades Executive Office (CGEO) in the Department of Education has developed a comprehensive guide to calculated grades for out of school learners &ndash; the students who are studying entirely outside of school &ndash; and has contacted each student individually on 25 June to invite them to apply for calculated grades.  The closing date for applications was last Thursday (2 July 2020) and applications are now being processed. <\/p>  <p>  In cases where a student is studying one or more subjects outside of school, school principals were asked to make every effort to provide an estimated mark for that subject provided there was  sufficient, credible evidence available from an appropriate source.  If the principal was unable to provide an estimated mark for any student they were asked to notify the Calculated Grades Executive Office of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its commitment to ensure that a calculated grade is provided to as many students as possible, the CGEO are currently undertaking a review of these reports with the schools involved to ensure that the correct procedures were followed. <\/p>  <p>  Despite every effort being made by schools and by the Department of Education, to provide calculated grades to as many students as possible, there will be a small number of cases where there is no credible evidence to support a calculated grade in a particular subject. To attempt to give a calculated grade in such cases would be unfair to all other candidates.  Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so. <\/p>  <p>  No decisions have been issued by the Calculated Grades Office in respect of any of these candidates to date (6 July 2020).  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has continued to engage with third level stakeholders regarding the Calculated Grades process for students seeking to progress to Higher Education.   This has resulted in an agreed common approach in relation to students who have studied some or all of their Leaving Certificate 2020 subjects outside school, and who have not been able to obtain calculated grades in those subjects.  Students who have applied for a calculated grade, with a view to satisfying matriculation\/basic minimum entry requirements and for whom the Department has been unable to award a Calculated Grade in the subject(s), will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation\/basic minimum entry purposes. The subject(s) for which exemption is granted will not attract points and the exemption cannot be used to satisfy additional programme requirements over and above the matriculation\/basic minimum entry requirements. <\/p>  <p>   These exemptions will be granted automatically by the CAO to those students who cannot be provided with a calculated grade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700084#WRY04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology","counter":1104,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700084#WRY04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1105,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[13937\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700084#WRY04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if consideration will be given to including Limerick Institute of Technology in plans for the Munster technological university in addition to Cork Institute of Technology and IT Tralee.","asker":"1519","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1106,"content":"<p>Under the statutory framework provided in the Technological Universities Act 2018, two or more Institutes of Technology (IoTs) may jointly seek TU designation through a prescribed legislative process.

These measures will take effect from September 2020. <\/p><p>In Spring 2019 the moratorium was relaxed for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allows them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This was an initial step and took immediate effect.<\/p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991. <\/p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.<\/p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. <\/p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.<\/p><p>A survey of Secretaries and Caretakers undertaken in 2019 identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April 2019 to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p><p>In May last year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim. <\/p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasted until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September 2019. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action. <\/p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  <\/p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department and Management Bodies are in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. These talks are subject to the normal procedures including confidentiality. The talks began in the WRC in October.<\/p><p>Following industrial action, which commenced on the 10th January 2020, both parties have agreed to return to talks at the WRC.

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: <\/p><p>For the 2020\/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.<\/p><p>If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant.<\/p><p>The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.<\/p><p>The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).<\/p><p>Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, <i>www.susi.ie<\/i>. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. <\/p><p>My officials have been in contact with their counterparts in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. They have advised me that full-time students who had part-time employment when the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment was introduced in March, can avail of this support payment. <\/p><p>It was announced on June 5th that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will now be extended from 9 June until Phase 5 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business (currently scheduled to begin on 10 August). I welcome this decision which further supports students who have lost their income due to the pandemic. <\/p><p>Although there will now be a two level payment structure to link the Pandemic Unemployment Payment level to prior earnings, no person on the lower rate of payment will receive less on PUP than they were previously paid by their employer.<\/p><p>The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books\/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1m added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.  Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In December 2018 a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This funding continued into 2019 and 2020. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.<\/p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

My Department will continue to collaborate with the NCCA to develop guidance to schools to assist them in their planning for the next school year so as to ensure that curricular priorities are delivered and that teaching and learning is optimal in these circumstances, guided at all times by public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Students going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of their preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for the operation of the state examinations. My Department will engage with the SEC in their development of fair and robust assessment arrangements in relation to both the Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the third level institutions, as part of the Transitions Reform Group, have been working in partnership with my Department to improve the transition from second level to third level. My Department has been meeting regularly with representatives from the tertiary sector in order to ensure that the third level entry process this year can progress as smoothly and equitably as possible. These meetings have involved stakeholders from my Department, the Irish Universities Association (IUA), the Technological Higher Education Association (THEA), the Higher Education Authority (HEA), the Central Applications Office (CAO), the State Examinations Commission (SEC), Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) and SOLAS. All bodies involved are committed to ensuring that students seeking to access tertiary education in this unprecedented time are supported in doing so.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances will continue to present challenges into the future.

In this forum, the providers have been advised of the measures introduced by Government, as part of the wider Covid-19 response, to support businesses at this time. These measures include the temporary wages subsidy scheme to facilitate employers to keep employees on the payroll throughout the Covid-19 pandemic in order to retain this link for when business increases after the crisis.

Further engagement will be undertaken with the provider representative bodies within the English language education sector in relation to their detailed plans for the wider re-opening of their premises and as they seek to provide greater clarity for their member providers. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations are undertaken as part of their development and implementation.

The process has been designed to arrive at fair representations of student performance which does not favour any type of student or school. <\/p>  <p>  Circular 0037\/2020, which was published on 21 May, set out the detailed guidance for schools on the operation of the calculated grades process. The document provided detailed information on the process of estimating marks for students to receive calculated grades.  Additional guidance to schools on the avoidance of unconscious bias and interpreting evidence of achievement in the case of students with disabilities was issued to schools on 28 May. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the guidance, teachers were asked to use their professional judgement  to arrive at an estimated mark for each student. The guidance required teachers to  utilise a number of records in assessing a student&rsquo;s performance and progress; for example, classwork and homework; class assessments; examinations in school at Christmas or summer, mock exams and also coursework.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of any approved reasonable accommodations, the estimate of the student&rsquo;s likely performance was to be based on the assumption that this accommodation would have been available had the examinations been conducted in the normal way. Since examination accommodations are intended to reflect students&rsquo; normal way of working in class, this did not require any special intervention beyond the teacher&rsquo;s understanding of how the student would achieve with the relevant supports in place. <\/p>  <p>  In order to remain objective, and to underpin integrity in the process, the guidance was absolutely clear that the school&rsquo;s judgements should only take account of existing records and available evidence of a student&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and abilities.  Teachers were asked to be alert to the issue of unconscious bias and were instructed that their judgements should not be allowed to be influenced by a student&rsquo;s behaviour, character, appearance, social class, or absences from school-based summative assessments due to illness, or any other subjective factors, whether positive or negative.  <\/p>  <p>  For the calculated grades system to be operated with integrity, and to  ensure fairness to all students, estimated percentage marks could only have been  based on credible, satisfactory, objective and unbiased  evidence.   Providing special consideration for any student, or any group of students, would undermine the principles of objectivity, equity and fairness, upon which the system had been based.  <\/p>  <p> The school-based part of the system of Calculated Grades concluded on the 22nd   June and the national standardisation phase has commenced. In the national standardisation phase, the school-sourced data will be combined with historical data order to generate the calculated grade for the students in their subjects. This standardisation process will be used to ensure that the calculated grades reflect standards that are properly aligned across schools and with a common national standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700088#WRCC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":1319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700088#WRCC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1320,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[14577\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700088#WRCC03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if arrangements will be made to cater for the specific needs of students scheduled to sit the leaving certificate exams in 2021.","asker":"1525","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1321,"content":"<p>Following the school closure in March 2020, my Department published a range of guidance to assist schools and teachers in ensuring continuity of teaching and learning for students as well as supporting their well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  This guidance aimed, inter alia, to ensure regular engagement of students in lessons, tasks and learning experiences across the range of curriculum subjects, provision of regular assignments and regular, practical, supportive and customised feedback on work submitted.  <\/p>  <p>  Schools adopted various ways to engage with their students in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at home, including by post, e-mails, communication apps, the school website, use of other digital communicative platforms, including live meetings. Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of these distance learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  It is a top priority for my Department to work toward fullest reopening possible.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, the Department recently published a report to Government on Planning for reopening schools in line with the Roadmap for reopening. This report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with relevant agencies, including the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), identified the following key priorities in supporting students in re-engaging with the curriculum in the new school year:<\/p>  <p>  1. The well-being and socialisation of students<\/p>  <p>  2. Assessing where students are in terms of their learning<\/p>  <p>  3. Identifying the additional supports that particular learners may require<\/p>  <p>  4. Exploring options for remote provision that will compliment in-school provision and address curriculum gaps experienced during school closure.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that schools continue to be best placed to make decisions about how to support and educate all their learners during this period. My Department will continue to collaborate with the NCCA to develop guidance to schools to assist them in their planning for the next school year so as to ensure that curricular priorities are delivered and that teaching and learning is optimal in these circumstances, guided at all times by public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Students going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of their preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for the operation of the state examinations. My Department will engage with the SEC in their development of fair and robust assessment arrangements in relation to both the Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700088#WRCC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Commission","counter":1322,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700088#WRCC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1323,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[14578\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700088#WRCC03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she has spoken formally with the chief executive officer and or chairperson of State Examinations Commission since her appointment as Minister; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1324,"content":"<p>Since my appointment as Minister for Education I have engaged in an extensive series of briefing discussions with senior officials of my Department across a range of education issues.

It is due to end on 10 August 2020.<\/p>  <p>  People who are considered high risk under the HSE guidelines in relation to COVID-19 are not entitled to the enhanced Illness Benefit payment for any period unless they have been diagnosed with or informed that they are a probable source of infection of COVID-19.  Standard Illness Benefit payment may be payable subject to normal certification and eligibility criteria, where a medical practitioner provides a certificate of incapacity stating that a person is incapable of work due to the medical condition.  Standard illness benefit is paid at a maximum weekly personal rate of &euro;203.  Increases may also be paid for qualifying adults and children.  This may be paid for an extended period, depending on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Standard illness benefit is the primary income support payment in this State for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type apart from the short-term payment in respect of COVID-19.  <\/p>  <p>  Employees who cocoon without a medical certificate may approach their employer in relation to taking annual or other paid leave - this is at the discretion of the employer.  Many employers can, and do, agree leave arrangements with staff who need to take short periods of time off.  These include arrangements to enable employees to work remotely from home, to work-up time taken, or to bring forward annual leave entitlements from future work periods.  The government has encouraged employers to support workers with leave requests at this difficult time and those with underlying health conditions should be facilitated where possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Return to Work Safely Protocol provides that if an at-risk or vulnerable worker cannot work from home and must be in the workplace, employers must make sure that they are preferentially supported to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres.  However, employers should enable vulnerable workers to work from home where possible.<\/p>  <p>  In general, if people have additional expenses related to their illness or they are struggling financially, they can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance which is a means-tested payment. <\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700089#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","counter":1363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700089#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1364,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[13869\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700089#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the contracts for new community employment supervisors will be of the same duration as existing contracts; and if she will address the situation regarding job security for these supervisors.","asker":"1615","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1365,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[13870\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700089#WRDD01600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the contracts for currently employed community employment supervisors will be protected and renewed; and if she will address the situation regarding job security for these supervisors.","asker":"1615","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1366,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 and 489 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Community Employment Scheme (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis.<\/p>  <p>  The programme is delivered through independent CE sponsoring authorities that operate in the community and voluntary sector.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention on a full time basis.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate carer's allowance is also payable with other social welfare payments e.g. pensions and disability payments. <\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  <\/p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 86% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard. <\/p>  <p>  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households.  Given the need to target available resources fairly and equitably to those in most need, I have no plans to change the means conditions for Carer's Allowance at this juncture.  While I will seek to improve the supports available for carers, any changes must be considered in an overall budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700090#WREE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":1444,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700090#WREE03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1445,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[14302\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700090#WREE03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated additional revenue that would be generated in a full year if the class S PRSI rate increased by 0.6%; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1446,"content":"<p>It is estimated that an additional &euro;78 million in revenue would be generated in a full year from an increase to the current Class S rate of PRSI of 4% to 4.6%.<\/p><p>This estimate is based on the latest available data and reflects macro-economic indicators for 2020. <\/p><p>The estimate does not take into account any possible changes in contributor behaviour arising from increasing the rate of contribution. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700090#WREE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","counter":1447,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700090#WREE04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1448,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[14306\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700090#WREE04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a PPSN, personal public service number, will issue to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1449,"content":"<p>I  can confirm that my Department has allocated a Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) to this individual and issued a letter advising the person of their PPSN on 2nd July 2020.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700090#WREE04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[14308\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700090#WREE04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the standard 19.5 hour community employment scheme weekly placement will be made available to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1452,"content":"<p>The person concerned had an interview on 02\/07\/2020, for an alternative CE scheme of 19.5 hours per week.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention on a full time basis.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate carer's allowance is also payable with other social welfare payments e.g. pensions and disability payments.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  <\/p>  <p>  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the number of carers identified as part of Census 2016, it is estimated that a universal (non-means tested) carer&rsquo;s payment could cost up to an additional &euro;1.2 billion per annum.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the need to target available resources fairly and equitably to those in most need, I have no plans to change the means conditions for Carer's Allowance at this juncture.

acknowledges the crucial role that family carers play and is fully committed to supporting carers in that role.  This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention on a full time basis.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate carer's allowance is also payable with other social welfare payments e.g. pensions and disability payments. <\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  <\/p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 86% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard. <\/p>  <p>  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households.  Given the need to target available resources fairly and equitably to those in most need, I have no plans to change the means conditions for Carer's Allowance at this juncture.  While I will seek to improve the supports available for carers, any changes must be considered in an overall budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700091#WRFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions","counter":1478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700091#WRFF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1479,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[14449\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700091#WRFF01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has not received their pension entitlements since retiring from Connolly hospital in January 2020 on health grounds.","asker":"1476","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1480,"content":"<p>Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and for no other reason and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions. <\/p><p>The department received a claim for IP for this lady on 27 November 2019.

The scheme aims to provide jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  YESS will provide a supportive structure for participants, including case worker support for both placement hosts and jobseekers.<\/p>  <p>  Since the scheme's inception, a total of 797 people have commenced a placement, while in 2020 to date, a total of 152 young people started on the YESS.  The COVID-19 pandemic emergency has impacted significantly on the scheme and as a result, a total of 149 YESS placements were temporarily suspended.  Of these, 64 have recommenced in recent weeks, while it is anticipated that more will also re-start as each phase of the current Covid-19 restrictions are lifted.  Staff engagement with potential jobseekers recommenced recently to re-start recruitment to the scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;3.35million has been allocated to the YESS for 2020.  An increase in the budget of 20% would amount to &euro;4.02m.  The funding available to date has not been a barrier to participation and additional funding of itself will not be the only driver to grow the take up of YESS placements.  The scheme is built around the voluntary engagement of participants and host organisations. A critical element is that the participant has an interest in developing a career in a particular role or sector and that they can be matched with a host who is willing and able to provide a placement including that they have the capacity to provide time, support and training for the participant. The availability of good matches between participants and hosts locally has also been a driver for take up of the scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  As the economy reopens and activation services to jobseekers increase it is planned to increase the use of the scheme to provide valuable work experience and training to young people who have been heavily impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.

The consultation asked specifically for the public&rsquo;s views on a voluntary Code of Practice for Pet Shops, and whether further legislation was needed regarding the advertisement and sale of pet animals. Following on from this consultation, my Department issued a voluntary Code of Practice for use by sellers or suppliers of pet animals in 2019.

The Regulations require anyone selling or supplying more than six pet animals a year to register with my Department.

These changes were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC).  These findings meant that, in order to grant licences, which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. These changes, which are substantial, have led to delays in processing applications. My Department has devoted considerable time and energy to introducing a robust and workable system and is now recruiting significant extra resources, both ecologists and forestry inspectors, to address the backlog.  A project management approach to clearing the backlog, by best and most targeted use of resources, is being put in place. <\/p>  <p>  On initial examination of this application, it was determined that five designated sites were proximate to the tree felling site.  The possibility that the proposed tree felling may have an impact on any one of these sites cannot yet be excluded.  Therefore, officials of my Department will complete the Appropriate Assessment report and determination.   It is also open to the applicant to have a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) completed by a suitably qualified person at their own expense and submit it for review by my Department&rsquo;s Ecology Unit which can considerably speed up assessment of the file.  If the applicant wishes to complete a NIS, they should contact my Department for guidance. <\/p>  <p>  Once the assessment of the application is complete, the forestry inspector will make their recommendations, which will form the decision on the application.

My Department has a range of measures in place to support young farmers and generational renewal, as part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and nationally. <\/p>  <p>  Under the CAP, the National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme provides financial support to young farmers and new entrants to farming during the crucial early years immediately following the setting up of a farm enterprise. Under the Basic Payment Scheme, farmers can apply to the National Reserve for an allocation of entitlements or a top-up to their low value entitlements. Successful applicants can receive support up to the national average unit value per entitlement, which works out at approximately &euro;260 per hectare including greening. Since 2015, the National Reserve has provided almost 8,000 young farmers with a new allocation of entitlements, or a top-up to the value of their existing entitlements. These are allocated on a permanent basis. For example, if a farmer is allocated entitlements from the National Reserve in 2015 worth &euro;5,000, this allocation would have been made in all Basic Payment years from 2015 to 2019, totalling &euro;25,000 over those years. The cumulative effect of these payments from the National Reserve amounts to approximately &euro;137 million over this period.<\/p>  <p>  The Young Farmers Scheme provides a further additional payment to eligible farmers, which comes from an allocation within the national direct payments ceiling. This Scheme was established in 2015 to encourage the participation of younger farmers in agriculture in the initial stages of their career and provided payments of &euro;68 extra per payment entitlement, for a maximum of 5 years, based on activated entitlements. Almost &euro;100m has been distributed to over 8,000 successful applicants each year under the Young Farmer scheme with an average annual payment per young farmer of approximately &euro;2,300. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, co-funded under the Rural Development Programme, young farmers can avail of the enhanced grant rate of 60% as compared to the standard rate of 40%. Some &euro;101 million has been paid under this Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are also a number of national taxation measures aimed at young farmers, specifically the &lsquo;100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; (530 claims costing &euro;1.6million in 2017) and the &lsquo;Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; (1,056 claims costing &euro;16.8 million in 2018).  Both of these measures assist farm succession and transfer. Other measures such as the relief from income tax for long-term leasing also benefit young farmers by increasing land mobility.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in 2017, the 'Succession Farm Partnership Scheme' was launched. This provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to further assist with the transfer of farms within a partnership structure, promoting and supporting the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms. This Scheme also encourages important conversations within farm families regarding succession planning.  <\/p>  <p>  Teagasc&rsquo;s recent publication &ldquo;Teagasc Education Vision &ndash; meeting future needs&rdquo; outlines the importance of education for young farmers and the development of their skills through education and training. This core function of Teagasc is supported and funded by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme also provides a source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort that do not have high levels of security.

The reopening funding aims to support providers to reopen, staff to remain in the sector, parents to resume work, and children to benefit from quality ELC and SAC. <\/p>  <p>  The new funding package contains four significant elements: <\/p>  <p>  1. A once-off reopening support payment for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. <\/p>  <p>  2. A once-off COVID-19 capital grant for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. <\/p>  <p>  3. Continued access for eligible providers to the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) <\/p>  <p>  4. Resumption of DCYA ELC and SAC programmes. NCS, CCSP and TEC will be available again for children attending ELC and SAC services from 29 June. <\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that this funding package will act as a significant sustainability measure for ELC and SAC service providers anticipating to reopen from 29 June. <\/p>  <p>   However, a number of supports were available before the COVID-19 pandemic to improve the sustainability of services during normal times, and these remain available now. The Department oversees a Case Management process through which local CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care services. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. Financial supports, which are also accessed through Case Management, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal. Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering initial, and on-going, case management assistance.

Under that legislation, the Law Society is the designated regulatory body for solicitors and the following procedures will apply to any ongoing complaints the Society has on hand: <\/p>  <p>  The Law Society, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator are the independent statutory bodies charged with investigating or resolving complaints against solicitors under the Solicitors Acts 1954-2015 and their attendant regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to point out that it would not be appropriate for any member of the Government or Department Officials to intervene, either directly or indirectly, in this statutory process or any related quasi-judicial proceedings that come before the Solicitors&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Solicitors&rsquo; Acts, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator also provides an independent forum to which members of the public may apply if they are dissatisfied with the manner in which the Law Society has dealt with any complaint made by or on behalf of any client against their solicitor. The role of the Independent Adjudicator is: <\/p>  <p>  1. to ensure that complaints about the conduct of a solicitor are dealt with fairly and impartially by the Law Society;<\/p>  <p>  2. to review complaints about any decision by the Law Society concerning an application for a grant from the Law Society&rsquo;s Compensation Fund; <\/p>  <p>  3. to recommend any changes in the Law Society&rsquo;s complaints procedures which are, in the Independent Adjudicator&rsquo;s view, necessary to maintain the highest standards.<\/p>  <p>  The holder of the Office cannot be a practising solicitor, a member of the Law Society or a practising barrister and shall be independent in the exercise of his or her functions.  At the same time, it is important to note that the Adjudicator&rsquo;s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the complaint itself. <\/p>  <p>  The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of serious misconduct and such complaints are either referred to it by the Law Society or have been made directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. I would point out that, subject to the relevant provisions of the Solicitors' Acts, it is open to any person who has made a complaint to the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal to make an appeal to the High Court where the Tribunal has not made a finding of misconduct in respect of the solicitor against whom that complaint has been made.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the remedies available under the statutory complaints handling framework that I have just outlined, it is important to be aware that aggrieved clients of solicitors may also choose to seek redress through the courts. This typically arises in cases of alleged negligence on the part of a solicitor which have had serious negative consequences for the client concerned. As with any court proceedings, it is considered prudent that persons considering taking such legal action seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their case, any limitations that may apply in relation to the passing of time and its possible legal costs implications.  Ultimately, it will be a matter for the aggrieved client concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to the circumstances of their particular case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700095#WRMM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1724,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700095#WRMM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1725,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[13821\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700095#WRMM05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the proposed new restrictions by the EU member states on incoming flights from the United States of America due to Covid-19 mitigation measures will include a ban on EU citizens accessing the EU from destinations in the United States of America; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1608","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1726,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to the recent European Council decision on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel in the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction.

The review is examining the adequacy of measures available to protect vulnerable witnesses during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, to help ensure the best quality evidence is available to the jury in making their decision, while respecting the dignity of the victim and their right not to be re-victimised by the investigation or trial process itself.  It is examining the entire legal process around sexual offences, from the initial reporting of an offence through to the end of any court proceedings, including the causes of delay in sexual offence trials, and the effect of delay upon vulnerable witnesses.

The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).  <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017.  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  <\/p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for the phased transition from adult wardship to the new decision-making support arrangements that will be available under the 2015 Act.   It provides for the review by the wardship court of the capacity of all current adult wards of court within three years of the commencement of Part 6 of the 2015 Act.  In each case, the ward shall be discharged from wardship and the court shall order that the property of the former ward be returned to him or her.  The safeguards and procedures of the 2015 Act will apply to a former ward who transitions to any of the new decision-making support arrangements available under the 2015 Act.  The current wards of court system will continue to operate until Part 6 of the 2015 Act is commenced.  It is not possible to commence Part 6 of the Act until the DSS is operational and ready to roll out the new decision-making support options that will be available under the 2015 Act.   <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.   The Steering Group has given detailed consideration to the feasibility of commencing the remaining uncommenced provisions of the Act however, due to the complexity of the Act and the interconnectivity of its provisions, it is not possible to make any further commencement orders until the DSS is operational. The DSS, led by its Director, is working tirelessly to put in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed to enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. Further funding will be sought through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021 but this will of course be subject to available exchequer funding through that process. In the interim, and subject to the funding allocation, the Department of Justice and Equality, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan which anticipates commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including for example the Courts Service and the HSE, Departments of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700096#WRNN03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":1766,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700096#WRNN03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1767,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[14119\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700096#WRNN03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when consideration will be given to naturalisation in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1768,"content":"<p>In response to a notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), written representations have been submitted on behalf of the persons concerned. <\/p>  <p>  These representations, together with all other information and documentation on file, will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and all other applicable legislation, in advance of final decisions being made.  <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service Delivery function of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

It is an important aspect of the National Strategy for Women and Girls and the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence and a range of actions are being taken in that regard, including public awareness raising campaigns. My Department developed an inter-agency plan to address domestic abuse during the Covid-19 pandemic and, in addition to the funding already allocated for 2020, has to date provided an additional &euro;285,000 to date to organisations in the sector, to support and extend the existing services they offer during this period of the Covid-19 crisis. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too attaches the highest priority to domestic abuse incidents. This continues to be the case during the current Covid-19 pandemic and indeed a targeted, proactive operation, Operation Faoiseamh, has been established to ensure that victims of domestic abuse are supported and protected during this extraordinary time and to ensure that any domestic abuse incidents receive the highest priority response. <\/p>  <p>  In its first phase, Garda Victim Services Offices nationwide made proactive contact with victims who have reported domestic abuse in the past, to identify any existing issues of concern.  I am informed that over 8,200 contacts or attempts at contact to victims of domestic abuse were recorded by Garda&iacute; as part of that work (between 1 January 2020 and 25 May 2020).  I am further informed that Phase II of the operation began in mid-May and this involves a focus on targeting perpetrators - and in particular, cases of persistent breaches of protection, safety and barring orders under the Domestic Violence Act.   <\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; also continue to develop their specialist services in this area and I understand that a total of 16 Divisional Protective Services Units have now been rolled out nationwide. This process is continuing and when complete, will meet a key action under 'A Policing Service for the Future', the implementation plan for the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to statistics on the number of incidents in Donegal as requested by the Deputy, I would first point out that the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of all crime statistics.  The CSO produces these statistics using data including data recorded on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s PULSE system and makes regular releases under reservation in relation to various crime statistics, including recorded and detected crime.  The CSO also continues to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address quality issues in the underlying sources used to compile the statistics.  <\/p>  <p>  However and in general, the Garda authorities have provided my Department with initial, provisional and operational data which shows that nationwide and in total, domestic abuse related calls have increased by 24% in the year to date; and that breaches of Domestic Violence Order Incidents have increased by 10% in comparison to the same time period last year. <\/p>  <p>  Further and in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query in relation to Donegal, the Garda authorities have informed my Department that there were a total of 1044 domestic abuse incident reports in the Donegal Division in 2019; and that this year, from 1 January to 1 July 2020, there were a total of 560 such incident reports in the Donegal Division.  I am informed that figures for 2018 are not comparable as the methodology at the time was different. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is provisional, operational data and is subject to change.  The Garda authorities inform me that these figures were arrived at through searches of the Pulse system to include incidents of the following categories: Breach of Interim Barring Order, Breach of Protection Order, Breach of Barring Order, Breach of Safety Order, Domestic Dispute - No Offence Disclosed, Breach of Emergency Barring Order, or any other incident type, with a recorded motive in Pulse of &lsquo;Domestic Abuse&rsquo; and incidents recorded on PULSE where the dispatcher assigned the type as &lsquo;DVSA&rsquo; (Domestic Violence\/Sexual Assault).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":1799,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1800,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[14294\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when each piece of Garda public order uniform and equipment was last updated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1801,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by law is responsible for the administration and management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the updating and distribution of Garda public order uniform and equipment, and I as Minister have no role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific nature of your query, I have referred this matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will respond to the Deputy accordingly upon receipt of this information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":1802,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1803,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[14296\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; by rank attached to each divisional protection services unit that have been established to date in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1804,"content":"<p>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the allocation and efficient use of Garda resources.

The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  in addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday. <\/p>  <p>  Consideration is currently being given to these issues.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 May the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave. The changes are aimed at individuals who may not have been on the payroll of their employer on 29 February, or been paid in either January or February 2020 and will allow for consistent treatment with other employees.  The amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process, but in the interim Revenue has agreed to provide a facility to accommodate such cases. Although expected to be implemented on the 12th June, Revenue launched a new process on Monday 8th June which allows employers to include employees returning to employment after a period of paternity, parental or related unpaid leave or were in receipt of Health and Safety Benefit, Parent&rsquo;s Benefit or Illness Benefit paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).  Employers who wish to access the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on behalf of eligible employees covered by these changes can do so by completing a short form available for download via MyEnquiries in Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service (ROS). The relevant details that employers will need to provide to Revenue include current contractual gross pay, pay frequency, normal PRSI class, type of leave the returning employee availed of and the date of return to work. Any retrospective subsidy payments due to impacted employees will be processed by Revenue in due course. This retrospection will apply from 26 March 2020, the date of return to employment or the date the employer was registered for the scheme, whichever is the latest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Advocacy Service","counter":1826,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1827,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[14444\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 400 of 16 June 2020, if the National Advocacy Service has been contacted by her officials to assist residents of a nursing home (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1466","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1828,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, having reviewed the records held by the Restorative Justice Implementation Unit, we have confirmed that there were a number of applicants who were resident in St. Margaret&rsquo;s nursing home, Donnybrook and all of these residents were linked to the National Advocacy Service when applying to the ex-gratia scheme.

As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.

In its report published in September 2018, the Commission outlined a vision and roadmap for strengthening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the broader national framework for policing, security and community safety. The report followed extensive consultations with communities and a wide range of stakeholders over fifteen months. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the Community Policing Framework is being piloted in tandem with the roll-out of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s new Operational Model, which meets a key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future.The Garda Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team. I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.<\/p><p>In a broader sense, the Deputy might also wish to note that implementation of A Policing Service for the Futurewill see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 repealed and replaced by a Policing and Community Safety Act. My Department is progressing work on the preparation of a Policing and Community Safety Bill as a matter of priority. <\/p><p>In addition to setting out a new governance and oversight framework for policing, it will redefine the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable, place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety and refine local structures supporting local accountability for policing.  In that context, my Department is currently in the process of finalising the most appropriate model to achieve this. All existing structures and approaches to community safety have been considered as part of this work and in line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing that community policing and community engagement should be at the heart of new structures and policing arrangements.<\/p><p>As I have indicated to the Deputy, work is well advanced on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Bill.  Once it is finalised, I intend to bring it before the Government for approval and publication in the normal manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":1836,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1837,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[14459\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to establish a task force similar to the one in Dublin's north inner city in the Dublin metropolitan region northern division.","asker":"1464","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1838,"content":"<p>Tackling serious crime in the North Dublin region is a priority for myself, my Department and across the whole of government. <\/p>  <p>  The then Taoiseach and my predecessor as Minister previously met with the Garda Commissioner and members of his senior management team in relation to serious crime incidents in the DMR North and the coordinated response mounted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle them - including community safety, intelligence and drugs and organised crime. I will continue to be regularly briefed by the Commissioner and senior Garda&iacute; on progress made in relation to various investigations being handled by the Division, as my predecessor was.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; are undertaking significant activity to counter drug crime at the local level, supporting communities through various preventative and detection initiatives.

Debt and debt intimidation are also getting focused attention: the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme, developed by Garda&iacute; and the National Family Support Network, has been in place since 2013 to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing drug related intimidation. <\/p>  <p>  In addition Garda resources in the Division have been increased significantly.  I understand from the Garda authorities that there are 804 Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR North at the end of April 2020, representing a 20% increase compared to the end of 2015.  Of these, there are 247 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Coolock District representing a 25% increase compared to the end of 2015.  Members in DMR include those assigned to Divisional specialist units such as Drugs and Community Policing. There are now also 62 Garda staff, an increase of 63% in the same time period.

This principle is at the centre of a new policy on community safety which is being developed in my Department.  The policy, which will be given a statutory basis in the new Policing and Community Safety Bill, proposes to establish and support a system of community safety at local level across the country.  Through cross-sectoral collaboration, and by drawing on the available services, these systems will be best placed to identify, support and implement, community safety according to the needs of the local community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1839,"content":"<p>Question No. 650 answered with Question No. 642.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Staff","counter":1840,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1841,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[14486\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700097#WROO04900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the ratio of nurses and general practitioners to prisoners in each prison in February 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1842,"content":"<p>Provision of safe and secure custody and dignity of care to persons in the penal system in Ireland is a priority for my Department and the Prison Service.<\/p><p>I understand that the prison healthcare service provides prisoners with access to the same range of quality of healthcare services as available under the medical card scheme in the community.

This is intended to support reform of the health service by facilitating the deployment of more clinical and operational systems and implementation of key eHealth initiatives.  Investment in underlying technical infrastructure specifically has benefited from this increased level of investment.  Whilst there is clearly further work to be done, that work is ongoing and significant progress has been made to date.  Indeed, without this commitment, the health service would not have been able to respond to the recent pandemic in the way that it did.  By way of simple illustrations, over the past 5 years the HSE has had a rolling programme in place to replace every desktop and laptop computer in the health system, has replaced or upgraded WAN and LAN networks, replaced phone systems on major (and many smaller) sites, has virtualised its server infrastructure, deployed a new national data centre and increased storage capacity and performance on all sites. Wireless LAN is available in 33 out of the 49 voluntary and statutory hospitals, with a national enterprise procurement at planning stage.  Whilst not all sites can be deployed at the same time, there are existing procurement frameworks in place so that hospitals and non-acute sites can have needs assessed. These frameworks facilitate the development of technical specifications for WiFi deployments, so that they can be submitted for capital funding and procurement.  The investment in this area is ongoing and the programme is supported by the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to multi-disciplinary conferences, teleconferencing and telehealth, one of the features of Covid-19 has been the significantly increased adoption of video as a means of communicating with each other during the pandemic> The health system has seen particular benefits with the adoption of this technology as we seek to enable social distancing a keep patients, clinicians and healthcare workers safe. The HSE has deployed multiple technologies at scale and at pace. Microsoft Teams has been deployed for staff, Attend Anywhere has been made available for clinical settings such as outpatient departments, and GPs have been able to avail of multiple choices.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of computers through CME, HSE IT security policies are very specific in relation to connection of devices such as laptops that are not owned and managed by the health service, to the health network. The preferred arrangement is that if a laptop is required, this be funded, deployed and managed through local IT operations. Laptops deployed in this way will support remote working and multi-disciplinary team working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700101#WRUU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2006,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700101#WRUU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2007,"qnumday":707,"qnumall":"[13931\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700101#WRUU02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when gynaecology appointments at Cork University Hospital, which were cancelled as a result of Covid-19, will recommence.","asker":"1521","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2008,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, in late March, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommended that all non-essential health services should be paused to protect and maximise the delivery of essential time-critical care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sl&aacute;intecare is about delivering a health and social care service that meets the needs of our population and attracts and retains the very best healthcare professionals, managers and staff.  The plan is to deliver a universal health service that offers the right care, in the right place, at the right time, by the right team with a priority focus on keeping people well, developing primary and community services within a national policy context, and ensuring we have the right hospital capacity for the needs of our citizens.<\/p><p>Key recommendations of the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report were to set up a Programme Implementation Office to oversee and enable the implementation of  Sl&aacute;intecare, to develop a detailed implementation plan for the reform programme and devise a detailed implementation programme project plan for each year of the plan, identifying key milestones which can be monitored across sectors.  Following the publication of the all-party Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy was agreed by Government in August 2018 setting out an initial set of key actions for a three-year period.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Executive Director was appointed in September 2018, a small team was recruited from within the public sector to form the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office during late 2018 and early 2019.<\/p><p>A detailed Action Plan for 2019 was developed for implementation, based on the Implementation Strategy and was published on the 13 March 2019. This 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan set out detailed timeframes for 138 projects that were to be progressed in 2019, as the first full year in the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision, and firmly established a programmatic approach to the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy.<\/p><p>A progress report on the implementation of the 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan was approved by the Government in April 2020.  Of the 138 projects for the period up to December 2019, 112 were on track, 24 have been progressed with minor challenges, and 2 with significant challenge. This work was carried out by many stakeholders, including from the Department of Health, the HSE, the voluntary and community bodies and key partners. It represents a concerted effort to deliver on the all-party vision and provided a strong foundation for moving forward into 2020, and beyond. During 2019, a series of important Sl&aacute;intecare reform Government decisions were made, including the agreement:<\/p><p>1. on the geographies for the six new regional health areas which is a first major step towards restructuring our health services in line with recommendation in the Oireachtas Committee report, which is informing the development of a detailed business case for consideration by Government;<\/p><p>2. to support the findings of the Independent Review Group established to examine private activity in public hospitals with the decision and announcement that all future consultant appointments, from mid-2020, will be to the new Sl&aacute;intecare Consultant contract for public only work;<\/p><p>3. on revised GP contractual arrangements in April 2019, which will see a &euro;210 million investment (40% increase) in General Practice over the next four years of which &euro;80 million will be available for the management of chronic diseases, like diabetes and COPD, through family doctors. This is expected to benefit more than 400,000 patients;<\/p><p>4. on the strengthening of the HSE with the formal appointment of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Board in June 2019 and the introduction of a new HSE Chief Executive Officer.<\/p><p>The 2019 Action Plan report setting out the progress against all the planned 138 projects can be found on the Department of Health website (link: ).<\/p><p>The experience of the first full year of implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare (2019) informed Sl&aacute;intecare&rsquo;s ongoing approach.  The 2020 Action Plan was drafted by the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office through the Sl&aacute;intecare\/HSE Joint Action Programme governance, and the Department of Health&rsquo;s business planning process, in anticipation of a submission to the Minister and the incoming Government following the general election of February 8th, 2020. <\/p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major disruptions to routine health services. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a singular and urgent focus on one priority, a highly focussed health and social care workforce, clear public messaging, societal engagement and real-time decision-making that facilitated rapid change and implementation. As has been noted in several quarters, many of the initiatives and changed ways of working that have been successfully and rapidly implemented over the past three months in response to the pandemic have been wholly aligned with the spirit of the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare Report.  The implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare now operates within a different context, but the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare are even more relevant at this time.<\/p><p>Key programmes that have progressed during the first half of 2020 include developing a specification for the three elective hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway, to be procured as part of the National Development Plan, as well as determining the roll out of the Sl&aacute;intecare Community Healthcare Networks and Specialist Hubs, to be staffed and geographically dispersed over one quarter of the country during 2021, with a view to covering the whole country by 2023.<\/p><p>The draft Programme for Government was published on June 15th, 2020. It reaffirms the commitment to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and pledges to accelerate the process.A revised Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2020 &ndash; 2021 is being developed factoring in the learnings from COVID-19, the new context within which the health system operates and the agreed Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700102#WRVV05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Reform","counter":2100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700102#WRVV05300"},{"type":"question","counter":2101,"qnumday":738,"qnumall":"[14102\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700102#WRVV05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to continue with the regionalisation of the HSE into separate health boards.","asker":"1489","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2102,"content":"<p>A clear governance and accountability framework was identified as a key building block of Sl&aacute;intecare by the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.

for public-only work in public hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, as part of the Common Contract for Consultants negotiated in 2008, many consultants holding specific contracts are entitled to engage in private outpatient practice outside of their public commitment. The 2008 Common Contract obliges the employer to provide facilities on the hospital campus for outpatient private practice and the provision of such facilities off-campus, on an interim basis, pending provision of on-campus facilities. Private clinics are currently located on the grounds of each the existing three children&rsquo;s hospitals.  The new children's hospital is obliged to provide such facilities for consultants holding these contracts.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, while the vast majority of services in the new children&rsquo;s hospital will be public services, within the new hospital an area has been planned which carries the designation of \"private clinic\".  The private outpatient clinic at the new children&rsquo;s hospital represents circa 0.25% of the clinical space within the new children&rsquo;s hospital. There are a total of 129 outpatient clinical exam rooms primarily accessed off the main concourse on the ground and lower ground floor of the new children&rsquo;s hospital, each of which are identical in design and fit out.

As part of his comprehensive response on 11 June , 2019, my predecessor , Minister Harris, noted that two reports had been commissioned by the Board of the NMBI.  Crowe Horwath was engaged to carry out an Organisational Review and BDO was engaged to carry out a review of Remuneration and Contract Management of Non-Permanent Employees.  The relevant reports were submitted in late 2015 with recommendations that  were accepted in full by the Board. Minister Harris further noted that, in view of the reports commissioned, the findings of same, and the steps taken by the NMBI to implement the recommendations of the reports, he was satisfied that significant action has been taken on foot of the complaints made.  These complaints were an important input to the enhancement of governance in the NMBI. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's current question to me focuses on three areas. Firstly, in relation  to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies which was introduced in August 2016. This Code is not designed to provide specific accountability mechanisms in relation to individuals. Instead, it gives a framework for good governance practice and it is the responsibility of the body itself to comply with the Code. The role of the  supervising Department is to monitor such compliance using the available mechanisms to obtain the necessary assurances. Secondly, the impact of certain conduct on the health and well- being of staff within the NMBI was one of the issues which had been raised.  While the initial complaint did not characterise the matters as falling within the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, health and welfare issues were dealt with in the subsequent review under the Protected Disclosure Act 2014.  Thirdly,  I note that complaints under the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Nurses and Midwives can be made to the NMBI by members of the public, patients, relatives of patients, employers, other healthcare staff or the Board of the NMBI if they have a concern about the behaviour, conduct, practice or health of a registered nurse or a registered midwife. <\/p>  <p>  In dealing with the matters raised, the Department ensured that a proper investigation was carried out and that any issues which had arisen were rectified and measures put in place to prevent a reoccurrence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700105#WRYY02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2254,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700105#WRYY02700"},{"type":"question","counter":2255,"qnumday":790,"qnumall":"[14227\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700105#WRYY02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an urgent investigation will be conducted into the alleged neglect of nursing home residents during the Covid-19 restrictions; if specific direction was given to nursing homes on the way in which the additional funding allocated to nursing homes was to be spent; and if such funding was for additional PPE.","asker":"1596","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2256,"content":"<p>Since 2009 the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the statutory independent regulator in place for the nursing home sector, whether a HSE managed or a private nursing home.

The decision to delay appointments and admissions is not undertaken lightly and when such a decision is made, it is based on the safe delivery of care to all patients. <\/p>  <p>  On 5 May 2020, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-urgent health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. CHI is now re-establishing services on an incremental basis.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE  launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with both CHI and the HSE in relation to paediatric scoliosis services. In this context, CHI has advised my Department that a General Orthopaedic Surgeon, based at CHI Crumlin and Tallaght sites, is due to commence in Q3, 2020. This post is for general orthopaedic and trauma surgery, to support waiting list activity, and will further support waiting times for children for general orthopaedic outpatient appointments., including scoliosis.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular queries raised regarding the cancellation of surgeries and capacity challenges, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700107#WRAAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2348,"content":"<p>Question No. 824 answered with Question No. 756.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":2349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700107#WRAAA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2350,"qnumday":825,"qnumall":"[14340\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070700107#WRAAA01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeline for the reopening of adult day services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2351,"content":"<p>As part of the overall effort to contain the spread of COVID-19 and in line with public health advice, day service locations have been closed since March.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. <\/p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by the HSE that as of June 29, 12,301 patients had been discharged from private hospitals having undergone an inpatient procedure since the arrangement between the HSE and private hospitals came into force.

The Central Statistics office (CSO) also makes available a range of data through regular publications on its COVID -19 Information hub, detailing the changing state of aspects of Ireland's economy and society since the COVID-19 outbreak. The CSO has also provided the infrastructure for researcher access to data to allow further analysis through the provision of researcher Microdata files.<\/p><p>Furthermore, comprehensive national statistics, information and data about COVID-19 in Ireland is published on a daily basis on the Covid-19 Data Hub and Dashboards which can be accessed at <i><\/i>.
