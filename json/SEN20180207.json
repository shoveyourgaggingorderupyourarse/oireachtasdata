This matter has been the subject of much scrutiny and media comment in recent years and the reason is clear.  The fact is that those who work in the Defence Forces who are often on the front line in an emergency within the State are paid a measly sum of money for the service they provide.  The representative organisations have demonstrated in recent times.  There was a demonstration outside Leinster House in late 2017 to highlight the impact this issue is having on many Defence Forces personnel.<\/p> <p>Figures released last year to my colleague, Senator Craughwell, showed that of the approximately 2,500 new recruits to the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps between 2013 and 2017, some 641 had left and only 1,822 remained.  The reason was that they were able to earn more money working in places like Tesco, SuperValu, Aldi and Lidl than for the Defence Forces.  They had made the decision to leave because they could not afford to remain in that position, this despite the fact that it costs approximately &euro;100,000 to train a member of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>We have to get real, which is why I am raising the issue with the Minister of State.  I have listened to some of the reasoned arguments given by the Minister and the Department on this issue to the effect that remuneration levels are within the confines or parameters of the pay agreements.  That is fine.  The matter can be deal with within those parameters, but a special case must be made for Defence Forces personnel.  There should be a stand-alone agreement to deal with the issue, given the low levels or remuneration of which they are in receipt.  The matter should be dealt with outside the parameters of the Public Service Pay Commission; it should be dealt with as an emergency.  Recently the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers outlined that its members had not, to date, received the pay increases they were due to receive in recent weeks.  I wonder why that was, despite the fact that administrative or management staff, that is to say, non-uniformed personnel within the Department of Defence, had received incremental pay increases under the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p> <p>There seems to be an issue.  Personnel are leaving the Defence Forces.  Another example is illustrated by personnel at Finner Camp in County Donegal.  Army personnel working there are being bused to Dublin where they work two days.  They are then bused back to County Donegal.  Is that the most efficient and effective use of resources within the Defence Forces?  I understand that, as a result of that policy direction, fuel costs at Finner Camp have gone up 6,000% during the past three or four years.  Is that an efficient and effective use of resources?  I am not sure it is.<\/p> <p>These issues need to be addressed.  The first is proper remuneration for Defence Forces personnel, some of whom are sleeping in cars.  Others cannot afford to pay mortgages, while others are living in absolute poverty, which is unacceptable.  That is no way to treat Defence Forces personnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#A00600","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Rates of pay and conditions of employment in the public service have traditionally been set by, among other things, reference to relative levels of pay across the various sectors of the public service.  Like other areas within the public service, the pay rates of members of the Permanent Defence Force were reduced during the financial crisis.  These decisions were not taken lightly but were necessary at the time.  The Government&rsquo;s economic policy has led to economic recovery and a resumption of economic growth.  This has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a sustainable and fair recovery in public service pay scales.<\/p> <p>In 2016, as set out in the confidence and supply agreement, the Government established the independent Public Service Pay Commission to provide an objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels in the public service, including the Defence Forces.  Following the publication of the report of the commission, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Both the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, were invited to the negotiations which were held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  They were afforded equal standing to other public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations.<\/p> <p>Defence Forces pay is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of the increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  Following the revisions of pay under the Lansdowne Road agreement, the first point of the pay scale for a corporal, including the military service allowance, is approximately &euro;37,000.  The first point of the pay scale for a sergeant, including the military service allowance, is just under &euro;40,000 per annum.  In addition, as a result of successful negotiations with PDFORRA, the pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 2013 was increased further.  The starting pay for a newly qualified three star private and the Naval Service equivalent saw an increase from &euro;21,800 to &euro;27,000 in gross annual earnings, inclusive of the military service allowance, with scope for further income from duty allowances.<\/p> <p>Further increases in pay will arise from the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 to 2020.  The agreement provides for increases in pay, ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus once again on the lower paid.  Arrangements are being made to process the first increase due under the agreement of 1% of annualised salary, effective from 1 January 2018.  Permanent Defence Force personnel should see the effects of the increases in their pay scales in the next few weeks.<\/p> <p>The Department of Defence, in conjunction with the Defence Forces, raised recruitment and retention issues for specialists as part of the submission to the Public Service Pay Commission.  The commission has prioritised the defence sector for a more extensive examination of these issues.  I understand both PDFORRA and RACO have been invited to make submissions to the commission.  Defence management is also preparing a submission.  The Public Service Pay Commission is due to complete this exercise in the second half of 2018.  The findings and proposals made will be considered at that time.<\/p> <p>The actions being taken are in line with the confidence and supply agreement; the recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission are being followed and that process should he allowed to continue.  So far, this approach has resulted in pay increases for members of PDFORRA and new pay scales for three star privates which were backdated to 2016 and paid in 2017.  Also, in line with the public service stability agreement, further increases for all members of the Defence Forces are commencing this year.<\/p> <p>I am satisfied that the processes I have outlined are appropriate in consideration of the matters raised by the Senator and delivering results for members of the Defence Forces.  I know that the Senator raised the issue of members not receiving their pay increases in early January.  The reason was their representative body had been late in signing up to the public service stability agreement.  A process had to be gone through, but I understand they will receive their increases shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#B00100","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The Minister of State went well over the time limit in giving his very comprehensive answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#B00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive answer.

As I know that he has come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health, I will not delay him.  This matter was touched on at the committee meeting.  It is about people who have appointments to attend hospital outpatient clinics.  The figure given at the committee meeting was that 479,000 people had not kept their appointments, but that figure does not necessarily refer to 479,000 different people.  Some people might have failed to turn up for a number of appointments.  If one divides 479,000 by 52, it comes to approximately 9,211 per week.  If one divides that figure by five, it comes to 1,842 a day.  What initiatives can be taken to help to reduce this level of non-attendance?  <\/p> <p>The reason I have tabled this matter is that I was speaking to some hospital staff during the Christmas period and one or two of them advised me that the level of attendance at their clinics was as low as 50%.  That results in a huge waste of staff time and resources.  Staff could have been doing a lot more or made appointments for others on the waiting list.  Has the idea of introducing a text messaging service across the board been considered?  Another idea that could be considered is that, rather than have 50 people turn up at 9 a.m., 25 might be given appointments at 9 a.m. and 25 at 10 a.m.  What has been looked at in that regard to make the system more efficient, reduce the level of waste and avoid using up the valuable time of the front-line doctors and nurses who are running the clinics?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#B00700","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue which, as he said, was referred to at the committee meeting earlier.  When one thinks about it, it is an incredible statistic.  As many as 2,000 people a day are not turning up for their appointments, at a time when we have chronic waiting lists.  Clearly, there is a serious issue to be addressed.  I, therefore, genuinely welcome the opportunity to answer the Senator's question.  It is welcome that it has been raised in the House.  <\/p> <p>Providing patients with access to clinicians in a timely manner is a key priority.  Reducing the number of \"did not attends\", DNAs, is essential to ensure available appointments are utilised fully to see and treat patients.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Outpatient activity has increased year on year.  However, the gap between referrals and appointment activity continues to widen.  Waiting list data at the end of December 2017 showed an outpatient waiting list of 500,800.  The HSE has advised that last year 479,000 outpatients did not attend their outpatient appointment.  By way of example, according to the National Children's Hospital, Temple Street, one in eight outpatient appointments is missed.  That means that valuable appointment slots are not being availed of, which is leading to longer waiting times for all patients.<\/p><p>In the light of such stark figures, it is clear that technological and e-health solutions have an important role to play in helping to resolve some of the most pressing and practical issues affecting health services.  A Programme for a Partnership Government seeks to drive improvements in the management of health services by mandating the HSE \"to engage strategic partners to help with the planning, financing and roll out of a 21st century IT health infrastructure, working towards the universal use of data to improve integrated care and outcomes across primary and secondary care\".  Potential solutions to the problem of \"did not attends\", DNAs, are being considered in the context of recommendations from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and the Sl&aacute;intecare report on access management and e-health.  <\/p><p>In regard to ICT supports for managing DNAs, the office of the chief information officer of the HSE has outlined a number of possible technology solutions to assist in improving the efficiency of the current arrangements.  A waiting list validation service has been proposed to focus specifically on DNAs.  The proposal is to validate waiting lists using SMS reminder messages, which will speed up the validation process and increase efficiency.  It is to remind patients of their upcoming hospital appointments via text message.  This solution has the potential to reduce the number of patients who do not show up for appointments and, most importantly, reallocate the appointment slots to other patients.<\/p><p>Currently, 31 hospitals use text message based solutions to manage DNAs.  The HSE and the NTPF are working to develop a standardised national approach and enable a reminder service that can process patient replies for hospitals that currently do not have solutions in place.  Further phases of the programme would see the standardised approach and solution being deployed nationally.  The Department is examining funding mechanisms for this proposal.<\/p><p>Overall, outpatient waiting lists remain a significant challenge to be addressed in 2018.  A number of steps, including the commencement of a national waiting list validation project by the HSE, are being taken to ensure the lists are accurate and these efforts are to intensify in the coming months.  In order to help patients to access timely appointments, I encourage all patients to let their hospital know as soon as possible if they cannot attend scheduled appointments.  That simple action on the part of individuals could free up almost 500,000 additional slots in outpatient departments which could have clear benefits in the context of overall waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#B00800","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

The Government is committed to doing so, but I do not know what the timeframe or timeline is.  The raising of the matter is also appropriate because I note that a major story carried in this morning's edition of  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>relates to new rules aimed at curbing challenges in proceeding with key building projects, on which I want to pass one comment.  Senators, Deputies, Ministers and councillors are all conscious of this issue.  <\/p><p>I took time today to check An Bord Plean&aacute;la's website and those of the respective planning authorities and note that a substantial number of senior Ministers have lodged legitimate objections for their constituents.

It is an open and transparent planning process.  It is important that we do not try to close it down for people with legitimate objections or concerns.  I am conscious that we have to roll out critical infrastructure, which issue has presented a problem.  In that regard, I am mindful of the North-South interconnector which is a concern for Deputies and Ministers in the Meath constituencies and others.  I am also mindful of the controversies in Dublin Port and D&uacute;n Laghaoire Port which are before the board.  There are a number of ongoing battles.  However, in a democracy it is important that we respect and allow people with legitimate concerns to express them, although, admittedly, we need to tighten all of the timeframes.  However, I do not want to deviate from the principle of what I want to speak about, namely, the setting up of an independent office of planning regulator.  The strong recommendations made by the Mahon tribunal include that we establish such a regulator.  It is important that the regulator be wholly independent and not subordinate to the State or arms of it.  It is also important that it be fully resourced.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming to the House to take this matter.

A properly functioning planning system is of critical importance in ensuring development across the country takes place in accordance with the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.  As in everything, balance is key in who gets to make representations and the kind of representations they get to make.  In that respect, transparency is key.  If we are to accept that people can make representations, we want to know who is making them and why.  Potentially we have a great opportunity to have a lengthy debate on different planning issues as we have the Chamber to ourselves, but I will stick to the issue raised by the Senator, in the first instance, the establishment of an office of planning regulator.<\/p> <p>As the Senator is aware, this afternoon the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, will be in the Seanad to take the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016.  The Bill contains the required legislative infrastructure to allow me to establish the Office of the Planning Regulator which was, as the Senator pointed out, an important recommendation of the planning tribunal.  The office will be independent of my Department and responsible for the independent assessment of all local authority and regional assembly forward planning, including the zoning decisions of local authority members in local area and development plans.<\/p> <p>The Office of the Planning Regulator will evaluate compliance with relevant national and-or regional policy, including the forthcoming national planning framework which will also receive statutory underpinning in the amendment Bill.  Among the functions set out in the Bill, the planning regulator will be empowered to review the organisation, systems and procedures used by any planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the performance of any their planning functions under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  It will also be enabled to consider complaints from members of the public.<\/p> <p>The planning regulator will have the power to advise the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government whether a plan made by a local authority conflicts with national planning policy.  In the interests of transparency, any such advice will be published.  The Minister will then make the final decision on whether a direction should be issued under section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and he or she will be accountable to the Oireachtas for his or her decision in that regard.  The planning regulator will bring an additional layer of transparency to the planning system, while maintaining democratic accountability which is essential for public trust.<\/p> <p>My Department has been progressing administrative matters in setting up the new Office of the Planning Regulator in so far as it can without the legislation being in place.  In addition, I am sure the Senator will be pleased to know that funding for the office in 2018 has been secured.

We can then set up the office with that person and later in the year we will formally open the office and it will begin its work.  By then we hope the different regional spatial economic strategies will be well developed by the three regions concerned.

As we look to fix the housing sector in the country while also planning for future population growth, local authority members, together with Senators in this House and Members of the D&aacute;il, will be a part of the solutions and driving those solutions.<\/p> <p>From my experience in Dublin City Council, when it came to things like the city development plan we were given some form of training.  High density ratios and the other aspects which needed to be considered when a development plan is being framed were explained to us.  We were told about the importance of different types of zoning, mixed use and those types of things.  I would like to think that training happens in every local authority, but if it is not, it is something I will consider.<\/p> <p>When it comes to county and city plans, it is not an executive function and members of local authorities have an extremely important role and responsibility.  I want them to be able to execute that responsibility with confidence.  They do not need to work hand in hand with the planners and will never be skilled as professional planners because it is not their full-time job, but they need to be able at least to engage with them at a sufficiently high level to make sure they are working in the best interests of the county or city in terms of development and planning.<\/p> <p>On transparency and confidence in the system, historically our planning system took a huge hit because of things which were revealed during the Mahon tribunal and other investigations.  Over recent years a great amount of work has been done to restore that confidence and faith in the system.  We have to maintain that, and that is why the recommendation from Mahon is so important.  The legacy will involve setting up an office, something the Government and Oireachtas will achieve this year.  It is a very important step change compared with how we viewed the planning process in the past.<\/p> <p>An extra layer of oversight and transparency will be transformative in terms of what we are hoping to do.  We hope to align our national plan all the way down to local area plans and have a seamless follow-through.  We want to be able to have confidence that someone is looking at every step of the process, independent of Government and each part of that process.  That is what the regulator will do.  It will be a very important change.  If we can achieve it together as soon as possible on the legislative side, I can then move quickly to appoint a regulator and get the office up and running.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#D00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1517999400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.15 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1517999400,"counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#G00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, Technological Universities Bill 2015 - Committee Stage, to be taken at 12.45 p.m. and to adjourn not later than 3.30 p.m., if not previously concluded; No. 2, Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 - Second Stage, to be taken at 3.30 p.m. and to adjourn not later than 5 p.m., if not previously concluded, with the time provided to group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes each and all other Senators not to exceed five minutes each; and No. 3,  Private Members' business, Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 - Committee Stage, to be taken at 5 p.m., with the time provided for the debate not to exceed two hours.<\/p> <p>With the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach, I would like to welcome the members of the Air Corps to the Public Gallery and thank them for their service in the performance of their duties on behalf of citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#G00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Is it proposed to adjourn the debate on No. 3 after two hours?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#G00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Yes, it will adjourn after two hours if not previously concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#G00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I also welcome members of the Air Corps to the House and commend them on their public service.<\/p><p>I raise the HPV cervical cancer vaccine and the reluctance of some people to immunise their children against cervical cancer.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Dr. Ciara Kelly in an article she wrote in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>in which she stated we should celebrate on the streets that we have a vaccine against cancer.  This is a medical breakthrough and the rate of take-up of the HPV vaccine should be 100%.  The vaccine could save the lives of 250,000 women who die worldwide from cervical cancer each year and prevent 4.5% of all cancers globally because the HPV virus is also responsible for a large proportion of head and neck cancers.  Each year in Ireland, more than 6,500 women need hospitalisation for pre-cancer of the cervix, 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 90 women die from the disease.  The vaccine could prevent the majority of these deaths.  <\/p><p>I also highlight how simple it is to arrange a cervical smear check-up.  All one needs to do is enter one's date of birth and PPS number on the <i>cervicalcheck.ie<\/i>website and one is informed when one's cervical smear check is due and an appointment can then be co-ordinated.  We need to start taking women's health more seriously and educate people to try to deter scaremongering campaigns that are limiting the take-up rates of the vaccine.  <\/p><p>I also raise the scourge of drugs and drug abuse in towns and cities nationwide.  The story of Carmel Kidney of Ballincollig in County Cork who lost three sons to drugs highlights the extreme tragedy and reality behind drug abuse.

We need a proper and open debate in this House about how we are going to deal with the scourge of drug-related deaths into the future and drug criminality.  We need to discuss openly possibilities regarding legalisation or some form of regulation without accusations from different sides of this House.  With the prevalence of new forms of drugs like Fentanyl where only seven tiny grains can deliver a lethal does and which is 100 times more potent than morphine and many times more potent than heroin, we need to think smart in terms of how we address this drugs crisis into the future and we need to start now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#G00500","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>If someone gets out a map of the island of Ireland and looks at the motorway and rail infrastructure, they will see there is a huge gap in the north west of our island.

There is no rail, motorway or air link connecting the fourth largest city on this island to the capital city.<\/p> <p>That neglect has severely impacted the entire region.  I speak as a Donegal man.  This is why it is vital that the national planning framework does not yet again leave behind the north west of Ireland, which has a population of 500,000 people.  It is critical that we get this right.  We are talking about the next 20 years of investment.

They are both visionary men who have worked together and come forward with a north west city region, which is a plan to turn around the neglect and underdevelopment of the entire north west.

How is it possible that in towns like Tramore with an increasing population and a high demand for both primary and secondary education, the divested schools, which are the very last entrants to the education sector and offer the only non-denominational choice for students and parents in their area, are first in the firing line?  A spokesperson for the Department of Education and Skills maintained that this has always been the arrangement under the divestment programme and that Educate Together schools must not crowd out existing schools.

However, people have contacted me, particularly from the south east, regarding a situation where there is no catheterisation laboratory available or at least, limited availability.  Catheterisation laboratories are very dear to my heart and they should be dear to anybody else's heart who has an interest in it.<\/p> <p>This morning, Paul Bell appeared on \"Morning Ireland\" and spoke about the ambulance service.

No Irish Rail services make a profit, but that is not unusual as rail services across the world run at a loss and require subvention.

Her contribution comes at a crucial time.  The draft national development plan 2040 provides for a possible &euro;115 billion in spending.  Without knowing the outcome of Brexit, it is premature.  It is very difficult to make recommendations up to 2040 without knowing whether there will be a hard or soft border.  That will affect the investment required to compensate for the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  Quite frankly, trying to exclude cities like Derry, Letterkenny and Sligo and the west coast and ignoring the effect of Brexit on Monaghan, Cavan, Louth and elsewhere does not make sense.  The issue should be considered very carefully, bearing in mind what is happening.<\/p> <p>Ireland West Airport in Knock is a modern structure and attracts over 1 million customers a year.  The surrounding areas have the potential for growth, feeding into the airport.  A tax-free zone around the airport would attract industry.  Depending on the outcome of Brexit, it would be in the best interests of UK companies to relocate part of their operations to the region in order to ensure connectivity with Britain through Knock airport, which has regular flights to London and elsewhere.  It makes sense for them to be located within the European Union and they would benefit from exports to 500 million people.  In turn, there are many opportunities for public companies to locate part of their plants elsewhere given the situation.  This is all unknown.<\/p> <p>Some time ago a point was made about a previous development plan.  The need for gateway towns and cities was discussed and virtually ignored.

Both offices have brought economic benefit to County Roscommon and Roscommon town, in particular.  Some people knock decentralisation, but it was and is a good policy provided it is carried out in the proper manner.  It was done properly in Roscommon.  Towns in the region, including Sligo, Longford, Carrick-on-Shannon and Letterkenny all benefitted from decentralisation.  People should not knock something which worked.

Farm organisations have been highlighting for some time the serious fodder shortage, in particular along the Border counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and in the west and north west.  Teagasc, among others, has highlighted the issue.  Unfortunately, the Government was slow coming out of the blocks but eventually it introduced a fodder transportation subsidy to help farmers with transportation costs if they are forced to buy fodder, for example, round bales of hay or silage from various parts of the country, mainly from the south.<\/p> <p>It was with dismay this morning that I listened to a gentleman by the name of Hugh Farrell from Ballyconnell, County Cavan.  He was representing the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association.  He highlighted the fact that four counties had been left out of the scheme, namely, Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon and Longford.  He was totally dismayed by the development.  I would like the Minister to come into the House, if possible today, to outline what criteria were used by the Department in how it defined what counties and what farmers in those counties were entitled to the fodder subsidy.<\/p> <p>From talking to affected farmers in various parts of the country I also learned that the subsidy is very cumbersome and there is a lot of red tape involved.  The order for silage or hay must go through the local co-op whereas heretofore farmers did it themselves.  I compliment the farming community on how farmers have looked out for each other and helped each other.  This is a serious issue for the farmers in Cavan, Monaghan, Longford and Roscommon.  They need help just like others.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister into the House, if possible today, and outline to us what criteria are involved and to ensure that those counties that are affected are included in the fodder scheme.  Farmers are going through a very stressful time and they do not have enough fodder to keep their animals alive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K00700","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank the ten Members who spoke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K00800","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thought Senator Davitt indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K00900","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I am okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K01000","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>He is quite welcome to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K01100","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K01200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I am happy to let Senator Davitt contribute if he wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K01300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>He is bowing to Senator Buttimer's seniority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K01400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I am not senior at all.  I thank the ten Members of the House for their contributions on the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>I begin by joining with Senators Gavan and O'Donnell in acknowledging the tragic accident this morning.  Thankfully, there have been no fatalities.  We wish the children and others involved in the accident every good health.  As Senator O'Donnell said, it is important that we get the answers to what happened to cause the accident.<\/p> <p>I share Senator Ardagh's views about the importance of vaccination generally and the HPV vaccination specifically.  I am a former Chairman of the health committee and we held hearings on the HPV vaccine.  It is important that we encourage all women to get screened and checked for cervical cancer.  The vaccine has been recommended by the World Health Organization, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.<\/p> <p>As Senator Ardagh correctly said, women are dying unnecessarily in some cases because they have not availed of the vaccine.  I understand there is a lot of commentary and deeply held views on the vaccine and immunisation in general.  I do not like to refer to terms such as \"empirical data\" because we are dealing with the health and lives of women but they show the vaccine works.  The HPV vaccine protects women against seven out of ten cervical cancers.  They are facts.  The points made by Senator Ardagh are ones we should support.  The Department of Health and the HSE are to the fore in promoting and advocating use of the vaccine but there is a duty on all of us to inform and advocate on this issue.  I accept people have deeply held views on the matter and perhaps never the twain shall meet, but Senator Ardagh has done a service this morning because it is an important topic to raise.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, was in the House before Christmas to discuss drugs.  I offer my sympathies and those of the House to Mrs. Carmel Kidney on the tragic deaths of her three young sons.  Drug abuse and misuse is something we must work collectively to eliminate from society.  We have the national drug and alcohol strategy.  The HSE, the Department of Health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other cross-departmental and agency groups are working to ensure we have a strategy in place.  Increased resources have been allocated.  Senator Ardagh is also correct that we need to have a cross-party discussion on the matter and come up with an action plan without making a political football of it.  I would be happy for the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to come to the House again to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>I join with Senator Mac Lochlainn in highlighting the importance of connectivity for all parts of the country.  He made his contribution in the context of the national development capital plan.  Senator Leyden also referenced it.  It is important to recognise that it is a ten-year capital plan for the entire country.  Senator Mac Lochlainn referred in his contribution to the north west.  From my understanding, chapter 8 now includes reference to the areas he mentioned, namely, Donegal, Letterkenny and Derry, along with the importance of the regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#K01500","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>It is very limited.

It is important we continue to have connectivity and understand we ensure public transport, be it bus or rail, is available in all parts of the country.  It is not just about the Luas or the DART.

It is a clear definition of a student union and it certainly reflects the understanding of student unions that we have in Ireland and which student unions have put forward.  It is a constructive proposal.  I will not speak at length to all our other amendments but we have put forward a number of ways of dealing with what is a core problem in the Bill as currently drafted.  There is a danger under the current definition that a student union's recognition and representation functions would derive from the recognition of its legitimacy by the institute or university rather than its own democratic mandate.<\/p><p>I know the Minister of State will want to speak to this as well but student unions play a crucial role in recognising that all cohorts of the university have their own power and representation.  There is a real danger of that power being taken.  I highlighted the question of the phrase, &quot;or other student representative body&quot; in the current definition as a serious concern, as it could potentially allow for the college administration to simply recognise any representative body or anything called a representative body, as I mentioned before.  It could be a representative sample or teacher assistants under the employ of the university, for example.  These could be made student partners, potentially circumventing the democratic mandate and role of the official student union in the event of a serious dispute.  This is something we do not want to see and we want to ensure there are proper procedures in place that will work.<\/p><p>I note that concerns were raised about this by Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il, where Deputy Thomas Byrne stated:<\/p><blockquote>I have met the student unions and I have to say I am shocked by some of the stories I have heard about student unions not being recognised and colleges putting obstacles in their way.  I have heard that about a number of colleges and I think it is wrong.<\/blockquote> <p>We have a chance to get this right and ensure there is no problem or false or damaging definitions in place.  We know there is a problem and I am appealing to the Minister of State about this.  She has taken on board constructive amendments and she has a history of working constructively with this House, taking on board ideas.  There is a problem in how this is defined and set out currently.  I will speak only briefly to our alternatives but it is key to note that there is a problem with the definition as currently set out.  I am sure it is inadvertent but it is potentially dangerous.  We know there are concerns and there have been instances of universities seeking to diminish the impact and effectiveness of student unions.  We need to ensure we do not leave space for that in this Bill.  We have a chance to prevent such wrongdoing.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 is our first and best choice because it has a strong definition of student union.  It recognises the autonomy of the body as well as its gubernatorial and representative functions.

It is a definition in which we endeavour to take on board the recognition role and have a clear definition of what is being recognised.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 6 is not an ideal option but at least it would move us somewhat forward.  It would ensure a university cannot switch recognition between a student union and another representative body in the event of a dispute.

I am concerned that the definition in its current format disregards that.<\/p> <p>One consistent feature in the history of the student movement in Ireland and elsewhere is the battle with some college authorities for legitimacy and autonomy.  Their depreciation is nothing new and it is done with intention with a view to favouring college authorities' agendas over that of students.

To return to this issue, it might be the case that some change of wording here would, in an ideal world, be desirable but I am not sure that it is critical.  The question of whether one would include the word &quot;autonomous&quot; or talk about students' unions as autonomous bodies appears to be an attempt to bolster a case that is a live issue in some universities and colleges in which students' unions do not want to be interfered with unduly by university or college authorities.  While there is a huge amount to be said for students' unions having the elbow room they need to do what they do, at the end of the day it is a fact that the money that students' unions spend comes from students and is collected by college authorities on their behalf.  I would be very wary of students' unions seeking arrangements whereby they have complete control over a pot of money but no accountability for how it is used.  I fear that this building up of students' unions as autonomous groups is, in some way, in furtherance of that particular agenda.<\/p><p>I am a firm believer in accountability.  If students' unions want complete control of the money that is available to them, they should collect it directly from the students themselves.  Some students would decline to opt in, but it is not an opt-in situation at present.  The money is collected from students by college authorities and then disbursed, whether students like it or not, to students' unions.  I am very leery of moving in that direction.<\/p><p>As a general principle, this legislation clearly provides for the important voice of students on governing bodies and, by extension, on academic councils and so on.  I do not favour getting over-prescriptive in this legislation.  It opens up debates which could be quite protracted and could involve other groups claiming an equal right to the same specificity.  We are moving to a competency-based system for the governing bodies of our third level institutions and that is a good thing in terms of the institutions being served well by their governance structures.  I favour the <i>status quo<\/i>for that reason.

It is just recognising the situation as it exists.  I do not think there should be too much problem with it.  I ask the Minister of State to give an undertaking to look at these issues.

Perhaps the appropriate solution is to look at how students' unions are treated and defined in the legislation on other universities.  Students' unions within institutes of technology have a slightly different standing from those within universities.  It is important in the process of creating new universities that students in the new universities are not at a disadvantage compared with students and students' unions in existing universities.  The goal is the levelling of various procedures and standards in the constituting of new universities.  One part of that is ensuring that the measures in respect of students' unions reflect the way they are recognised and treated in other universities.  Autonomous does not mean unaccountable.

Similarly, in section 82(5) of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, when referring to charters, it says, \"In preparing a charter, the governing body of an Institute of Technology shall consult, in such manner as the governing body thinks appropriate, with the academic council ... and other staff of the Institute, any recognised trade union or staff association, and any recognised student union or other student representative body.\"  In addition, trade unions and staff associations are recognised by the Technological Universities Bill in section 9(5)(b) in the context of the procedures relating to the resolution of disputes.  It is clear there must be mutual co-operation between the technological university and the students' union, and unless both recognise each other, there can be no dialogue or productive interaction.  It is in this sense that the concept of recognition pertains.<\/p> <p>The recognition by mutual parties must also prevent the unworkable and unwanted situation which could occur if there was a plethora of single-issue bodies purporting to represent student concerns.  Even for a handful of students to require constant interaction by the technological university with such bodies would be to the detriment of the representation of all concerns of students by the recognised students' union.<\/p> <p>The definition in the Bill also includes a reference to other student representative bodies which ensures the definition also includes the possibility of there being more than one student representative body in the institution in question such as a students' union representing postgraduates.<\/p> <p>In terms of the proposed definition, the entire statement relates to the independence of students' unions with no corresponding insertions relating to either governance or accountability for the funding that is channelled to the students' union.

My reason is they are separate, distinct and equally valuable institutions.  As the name implies, universities have traditionally covered a very wide range of subjects, from music to the humanities, Latin, Greek, the classics, archaeology, architecture and medicine, whereas technological universities tend to concentrate on technical subjects.  They started off as regional technical colleges and then became institutes of technology and are now to become technological universities.<\/p> <p>I received correspondence from somebody who taught in the institutions and is not hostile to them.  He is concerned about the use of the term \"technological university\" and what will flow from recognition of this title.  He maintains that the term implies that institutes of technology that will not join in the arrangement will be seen as second level and inferior to those that will engage in it.  That is one difficulty.  <\/p> <p>The question then arises of who will go to the universities.  He says he has seen more and more students go to universities not because it is the right choice but because it is expected, including by their parents.  That reinforces the view that those that will remain as institutes of technology may be seen as second rate and that students may be drawn unnecessarily towards a university.  Getting into university is seen as a badge of success or failure.  If someone gets into university, he or she is seen as a success and if he or she does not, he or she is seen as a failure.  That is not correct.  <\/p> <p>Another salient point made was that 99% of students in Dublin 6 went on to third level, whereas only 15% of students in Dublin 17 did.  There is a catastrophic difference between the 99% of students in Dublin 6 and the 15% of students in Coolock and similar areas.  This raises the question as to whether the 99% of students in Terenure need to go to universities?  Is it their parents who are pushing them to do so?  Would they be just as well off taking courses in woodwork or landscape gardening?  Why would virtually 100% of students in a particular area go to university, when only 15% of students from area such as Coolock go there?  That is a worry that I share with the gentleman in question.  <\/p> <p>Why not just call them institutes?  Many of them are actually not universities but some are.  Some are very close to being universities, while others by their ethos and nature are just technical.  I am not sure they are universities, but I recognise at this stage of the game that it is highly unlikely that the title of the Bill will be changed.  Howver, it is important that we raise these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#U02000","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I agree with some of what Senator Norris said.

That is fine if a college wants to remain in that space on specific engineering and technical arrangements.

The argument is that the south east is the only region which does not have a university.  The institute itself responded to that need with limited resources.

My criticisms are that the colleges, which are aspirational and have really worked hard to raise their game with the courses they deliver, along with staff qualifications, may not be rewarded by the Bill.  I agree with Senator Norris in some ways.  We must have technological universities.  However, there is a place for everybody.  Institutes of technology should not be looked at as second class.  Regional technical colleges were looked at as second class in the past.  It meant that students were moving out of their regions.  I gave the example on Second Stage of how over half of leaving certificate students in the south-east region move out of it for third level education.  That is not sustainable.  It is having a direct impact, not only on the economy of the south-east region but on its society.  It brings a mindset that we are second class.  By God, we are not second class.  We depend on the State, the mechanisms in education, the Civil Service and the HEA not to deprive regions and their citizens access to adequate third level education.<\/p> <p>I have suspicions - Senator Norris can call them conspiracy theories if he likes - that the third level funding cake in this country is of a certain size.  If the cake has to be sliced up to include an additional university, then the slices become smaller for the rest of the universities.  There is resistance to this.  I saw that during the campaign for a university for the south east over the past 20 years.  Waterford has proved its ability in terms of the courses it offers, the graduates it presents and the commitment of its staff to reach PhD level and high teaching standards.  It has reached all of those with one hand tied behind its back.<\/p> <p>That is why the argument has always been made for Waterford to have a university.  I was delighted when a technological universities Bill was included in the programme for Government in 2011.  However, there have been some tweaks about which I am concerned.  I will come back to them later on other amendments.  We must support those institutions which aspire to high standards and to serve the citizens and their regions.  We need to acknowledge the technical colleges, the vocational system and the apprenticeships.  We must encourage people through those career paths where there is lifelong learning which opens many doors.  We need to be strong in all of these points.<\/p> <p>I support this Bill but I will be critical of some aspects concerning eligibility criteria.

I have visited the various institutes of technology around the country.  In Carlow, one will find the finest courses in aircraft engineering and maintenance.  In Waterford, one will find fantastic IT systems.  In Letterkenny, one will find marvellous catering courses.

I have been advised by people close to the situation.  The idea of narrowing down and concentrating on entrepreneurial matters affects all universities.  The drift towards doing what industry wants because it will invest in particular kinds of research guides research in certain directions and can tend to exclude other areas, especially the humanities.<\/p> <p>My suggested wording on promoting an ethos that supports entrepreneurship, creativity, autonomy, innovation and engaged citizenship will be similar to this amendment, albeit a little more expansive.  The insistence that a university would have an exclusively entrepreneurial ethos is limiting, seems at variance with the remit of universities worldwide and may be in conflict with earlier paragraphs in this subsection.

Rather, the concern is with how it is worded in the Bill.  Had paragraph (IV) read \"supporting entrepreneurship\", none of us would have raised a question.  The paragraph sends a strong message, one that effectively permeates and affects the rest of the Bill, as Senator Norris stated.  Under this paragraph, a technological university must promote \"an entrepreneurial ethos\" in the performance of its functions.<\/p> <p>We must be open to taking on constructive and helpful amendments like this one.  That is good practice in academic work and in our role as legislators.  Since we are speaking of universities, let us be clear in our definitions.  All academics would respect that.  \"Ethos\" means the fundamental character and is used to describe the guiding ideals, beliefs and focus of a community, nation or entity.  In \"ethos\", we are saying that this is to be the guiding principle or character of the university.  That is a significant and weighty word to attach in this space.  There are important distinctions between entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial and innovation.  My colleague has referred to international universities and I know of longer definitions, but one of the simpler distinctions is that, while innovation is about the creation of new capacities, ideas and knowledge, entrepreneurship is about the use or exploitation of capacities, knowledge and ideas.  They are different.  I do not say \"exploitation\" in a negative sense; I am referring to use.  The other definitions of \"entrepreneurship\" are narrow, for example, the activity of setting up a business or businesses and taking on financial or other risks in the hope of profit or success.  Entrepreneurs do important work in society, but it relates to identifying a business or other opportunity to profit or benefit from knowledge or ideas.<\/p> <p>Within our institutions of learning, we also need to value innovation, which is about driving new ideas and looking at new ways of thinking about things.  That is why \"creative\" is included in the simple definition proposed by my colleague.  This is important.<\/p> <p>I referred to the Centre for the Creative Arts and Media in Galway and we have discussed the institutions of law and the role of the humanities in our institutes.  If we want to ensure that the new technological universities are empowered to explore and drive ideas in ways that may have benefits that are not about profit, but rather other forms of benefit, and expand our collective knowledge, they need to be mandated to do that.  If they are charged with the fundamental ethos of being required to determine at all points how something can be translated into business or profit, it will be concerning.  There are points at which entrepreneurship and innovation are deeply complementary, but we should acknowledge that there are other points at which they are contradictory.  For example, it may be entrepreneurial to say that, since an institute can make more from a particular medication or product, a low-cost or no-cost alternative should not be proposed.  If we are driven by a business logic, we will look to where that benefit can be found as opposed to the wider benefit.<\/p> <p>This is a constructive and simple amendment.  It gives our universities freedom and support.  I imagine that they support it, and I hope they do.  I also hope that the Minister of State will take it on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#X00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me latitude in my previous contribution.  I will be brief and speak to the amendment this time.  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response to the amendment.  The Bill's wording is that technological universities should promote \"an entrepreneurial ethos\".  To me, an entrepreneurial spirit is already creative and innovative.  We should not fall out over this wording.<\/p> <p>Regarding the general section on the functions of technological universities, it is important that they be given the tools to attain the intellectual, creative and physical infrastructure capacity that they will need to achieve the objectives and standards that we are setting for them.  They should be given any support that is required to elevate them to the standard to which we all aspire.  It is not good enough just to set criteria and introduce legislation and then expect institutes to reach the new standards without additional resources and supports.  That would be an unfunded mandate.  It is all very well for us as policymakers to set the bar high and introduce legislation, but we must apply a realistic aspiration and provide realistic supports, even if it only happens over time.  That will come down to the Minister of State seeking support in forthcoming Government budgets, and I look forward to supporting her in that.  To achieve the Bill's aspiration and allow technological universities to fulfil the functions that we are laying out, their intellectual and creative capacity will need that resourcing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#X00400","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I cannot see why anyone would object to this amendment.  Entrepreneurism is important.  Last week, I went to the House of Commons with a bunch of entrepreneurs to discuss Brexit.  I brought them over.  I hope there will not be, but if there is an objection from the Department to the words \"creative\" and \"innovative\", I will be worried and have to wonder what has prompted it.  Surely the Department is not arguing for entrepreneurism at the expensive of everything else.  That would be indicative of such an extreme ideology that no one could sign up to it.<\/p> <p>There is nothing threatening in the words \"creative\" and \"innovative\".  Regarding Senator Coffey's point, their meanings are not quite the same.  For example, I could be an entrepreneur by doubling the price of my product.  I am not being creative or innovative.  I am just creating more money.<\/p> <p>Let us not get caught up in this narrow definition.

For me, therefore, including the word \"innovative\" would be hugely important.  I do not want our future to be the same old same old in going down a dark hole.  I want it to be bright, which is why I say we should include the word \"creative\".  This is about opening and expanding minds.  It should be entrepreneurial, which would be brilliant, as we want to have the best and innovative ideas, but it has to be more than this, which is what I am arguing for.

Section 9 is approximately three pages long.  In subsection (4) there is a clause on promoting an entrepreneurial ethos.  Section 9(1)(c) provides that it will be a function of the technological university to \"provide for the broad education, intellectual and personal development of students, for the purpose of enabling them, as graduates, to excel in their chosen careers and to contribute responsibly to social, civil and economic life in innovative and adaptable ways\".  Section 9(1)(k) provides that a technological university will \"serve the community and public interest\" by \"developing ... strong social and cultural links, and links supporting creativity, between the technological university and the community in the region in which the campuses of the technological university are located\".<\/p> <p>There are other provisions included in the Bill which speak to innovation, the humanities, creativity, local interests and the development of the student.  Section 9(1)(g) provides that one of the functions of a technological university shall be to \"support entrepreneurship, enterprise development and innovation in business, enterprise and the professions through teaching and the conduct of research and through effective transfer to those and other sectors of knowledge arising from that research\".  <\/p> <p>The word \"creativity\" is contained in the Bill.  The Senator referred to one small clause, but all of this is referred to in the Bill.  Section 18(2)(e) refers to \"the plans of the technological university to develop and promote strong social and cultural links, and links supporting creativity, between the technological university and the community in the region in which the campuses of the technological university are located\".  I said on the last occasion that I had had the huge pleasure of visiting the institutes of technology and seeing creativity out the door.  I have seen innovation, the humanities, the wonderful nursing schools, child care facilities and the teaching of fantastic subjects in the institutes of technology, to which I pay tribute for what is ongoing.<\/p> <p>Senator Paudie Coffey spoke about the need to ensure there would be money behind the formation of technological universities.  With hand on my heart, I say that in budget 2018 we showed that intent and money was put on the table.  There was &euro;200 million for a PPP for the 11 institutes of technology throughout the country.  Since 2016 an additional &euro;100 million has been put into third level education and third level institutes.  I will be fighting hard on that front.  A budget has also been put in place for the development of technological universities.  Some of the institutes are further along the line and we will help them, budget-wise, as they come through.  As a Minister of State, I assure the Senator that there will be money and resources available to help the institutes join in the consortia and become technological universities.<\/p> <p>I want the House to see that a reference to creativity is included in the Bill.  Members will have heard of STEM subjects, but I am a Minister of State who shouts for STEAM, with the arts at the heart of STEM.  We need innovation and creativity, within which research falls.  I, therefore, ask Members to accept what we are doing but not to accept it in good faith as it is written into the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#Y00200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I heard the Minister of State refer a number of times to STEAM rather than STEM.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#Y00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I take on board the words used in the different parts of the Bill referred to by the Minister of State.

As would the amendment Senator David Norris suggested he would table, mine would promote an \"entrepreneurial, creative and innovative ethos\".

I recognise this and acknowledge that the words to which she referred are positive.  There is, however, a crucial concern.  As I described, the ethos is the guiding principle of the institution.  It is, therefore, a concern.<\/p> <p>Senator David Norris has indicated that he may table further amendments on report Stage.  I may do so also.  The Minister of State may wish to table amendments too.  I think the proposal and the idea of having a creative, innovative, entrepreneurial ethos as set out by my colleague are exciting and positive.  Alternatively, if one wished to remove the word \"ethos\" from that particular, narrow context and talk simply about supporting entrepreneurship, that would be fine.  The key concern is that having the word \"ethos\" in the section means that it would permeate and affect all other positive aspirations outlined by the Minister of State because we would then have to question if they would be subject to it as their driving character.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know that is not the Minister of State's intention, that that is not what the Bill is about and that the Minister of State has taken great care in many sections to address the matters of creativity, innovation and social inclusion.

The only thing that talks about ethos is \"promoting an entrepreneurial ethos\".  The whole range, direction and movement is towards entrepreneurship.

They were very constructive and sought to ensure a voice for students from each of the different campuses affected.  From our perspective, I recognise that there was an amendment from the Labour Party in respect of ICTU and an amendment from Senator Grace O'Sullivan in respect of academic representation.  However, I need to raise a key point because I will reluctantly put forward amendments on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>We sought to identify how key stakeholders could be adequately and appropriately represented on the governing body in a way in which would be constructive and useful.  We have not had the opportunity to debate that because the amendments were ruled out of order.  If we are going to use the fact of the number on the governing body as the limitation for us to be able to discuss this, unfortunately and regrettably, we will need to table amendments in respect of those who are already provided for. <\/p> <p>We sought to add to the provisions of the governing body rather than diminish the space which had already been carved out.  I wish to signal now that, unfortunately, we may need to look to paragraph (h).  It specifies quite a wide number of members which is interesting given the limitations elsewhere.  It states that there can be at least three but not more than nine external members, one of whom shall have an expertise in standards and practice in higher education outside the State.  That is totally appropriate.<\/p> <p>Confusingly, the members would be nominated by a committee of three.  Perhaps there might need to be at least four, given that there has to be one person who was nominated by a committee of three.  Perhaps there is a drafting contradiction in the Bill in that regard.  Maybe we will need to try to draw out and specify on Report Stage exactly how that external membership will be broken down.  Will there be a member from ICTU or a representative of USI, even though it does not represent all students' unions in Ireland?  It is a cumbersome way to address the issue, and I am loath to do so because I respect the fact that universities will have constructive ideas on how they would like the external membership capacity reviewed.  However, it has been left to us as the only way to engage with the Bill.  It will not involve a charge on the State because the spaces are already provided for.  I am loath to have to be so prescriptive, but I feel that is how we will have to proceed.  I am signalling my intention at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#BB00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I put forward two amendments which would have dealt with members of education and training boards, ETBs, which are currently involved in institutes of technology, and retaining membership on the boards of technological universities.  It is sad that they were ruled out of order.  That is nothing to do with the Minister of State and I know the Cathaoirleach is bound by rules, but going back to what Senator Norris said, if every few pennies will rule something out of order, it is very hard to get anything through the House.<\/p> <p>It strikes me that it is an error to not have greater representation for ETBs.  It maintains a link through the education system from national schools to ETBs to technological universities and so on.  Between Blanchardstown, Tallaght and DIT there are 18 representatives from ETBs.  When the Bill is passed, there will be one.  There is something terribly wrong about that.  The Bill breaks the link.<\/p> <p>ETBs are inherently populated by local authority representatives and people who have a genuine interest in education and delivering it locally.  We will not change the Bill but it is worth putting my comments on the record.  The debate will not impede the passage of the Bill, but perhaps we should stop trying to take away local democracy and start building processes around it.

In section 17 of the Bill, the functions and the role of the academic council within the technological universities are clearly outlined.  They include developing new university programmes, promoting the interest of community stakeholders, selecting new research areas, looking at questions of assessment, appeals and academic standards and, crucially, making recommendations around the selection, retention and exclusion of students.  It is clear the academic council has a critical role and is an important forum for how the university will develop, with many fundamental and important decisions being made.  It is therefore crucial that students have a voice, role and representation on the academic council, and that the voice be a strong one.  Many would speak about the community of learning that we hope for and aspire to in all our third level institutions and in our universities, and students are a crucial part of that and, therefore, some of the work of the academic council.<\/p><p>The current concern about the Bill may arise from an oversight and it is not the intention of the Minister of State or any of the institutions.  The Bill currently does not provide any guarantee there will be any student representation on the academic council.  As drafted, the Bill states, &quot;shall provide for such number of students of the college, as it considers appropriate, to be members of the academic council&quot;.  The concern is that a technological university could consider it appropriate to have no representatives of students on the academic council.  That is not a practice people would want.  I have spoken to staff and student members of academic councils and most people would recognise that there is a constructive and positive role in having all those voices represented.  There is a concern because as it is currently set out, there is no guarantee of a student voice within the council.<\/p><p>This does not fit the intention of the Bill and I imagine it is not the Minister or State's intention.  We really need to see a signal from her in this regard.  I note that on Second Stage she spoke about student representation on academic councils and this is an opportunity for her to signal that where there is an inadvertent omission within the Bill, she would be willing to address it or take it on board.  She said on Second Stage that students should be part of the academic council.  This is a chance to ensure we follow through and put in place a basic mechanism for this.  We are willing to work with the Minister of State and others across the House to find the most constructive way forward, so we have put forward four alternative ways in which the matter could be addressed.  We are happy to work with the Minister of State and others in the House around any of them.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 offer two key options.  Amendment No. 19 allows for at least two but not more than four student members.  Amendment No. 20, which is very basic, indicates the student membership of the academic council should not fall below one member, meaning there should be a minimum of one student on each academic council in each university.

One could ask why a limit of four should be put on this but others could say each academic council should have a minimum of two and be able to determine its own number.  That is something we can examine on Report Stage.  It is hard to see how we would not accept a minimum of one student, nominated by the student union in accordance with its own procedures, as specified in amendment No. 20.  I urge colleagues across the House, including those in Fianna F&aacute;il, to say that surely, as representatives of the party in this House, there should be the right to support and put forward constructive proposals.

Today, we are allowing that a worst-case scenario would never arise.  Although it would not be the intention of any of the institutions to allow it to arise and many of them deeply value student participation on academic councils, we should not allow the possibility of no student representation at all on the academic councils of our universities.

That is in line with the legislation applying to universities.  Section 28(1)(c) of the Universities Act 1997 provides that the composition of the academic council should include an \"appropriate number of students\".

The Bill is therefore primarily intended to give legislative effect to the planning-related recommendations of the tribunal report, providing for the establishment of a new independent office of the planning regulator, OPR, the statutory underpinning of the proposed new national planning framework as a successor to the 2002 national spatial strategy, and other updates to the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, that are necessary to deliver greater transparency, efficiency and integrity in the planning system, including giving legislative effect to all further planning-related recommendations of the Mahon tribunal report.<\/p> <p>As outlined, the main overarching objective of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a new independent office of the planning regulator whose key functions will be the following: evaluate and assess local authority development plans, variations to development plans and local area plans during their preparation, including proposals on land zoning; make statutory observations and recommendations on the content of such plans and strategies, as appropriate to the relevant local authorities and regional assemblies, with a view to ensuring that the plans or strategies set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and development of the area concerned which is consistent with national and regional policies and objectives; undertake reviews of the organisation and systems and procedures used by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the performance of their functions under the planning Acts; and undertake research and conduct programmes of education and training - including for elected members and officials of planning authorities - to underpin the principles of proper planning  and sustainable development.  The core key function of the OPR - evaluating and assessing local plans end regional strategies - will also enable the regulator's office to make recommendations to the Minister on exercising the pre-existing ministerial direction powers under the Planning Act to ensure that a plan or strategy sets out an overall strategy for proper planning and sustainable development for the area concerned.<\/p> <p>The establishment of this new office to oversee the development plan process and the planning  system generally will add another layer of sophistication to the institutional arrangements within the planning system with a view to ensuring that the overall integrity of the system is preserved and, where possible, enhanced.  In this regard, it is important that we learn from past well-reported experiences in the planning system, which gave rise to the establishment of the Mahon tribunal, and that we endeavour to ensure that they are not repeated in the future.<\/p> <p>A properly functioning planning system is absolutely critical to the ongoing development of all parts of the country and to ensuring that development takes place in accordance with the principles of proper planning and sustainable development, namely, that development takes place in the right locations, in the right way and at the right time to meet the needs of people while simultaneously protecting the many qualities of the natural and built environment.  That is the primary purpose of the planning system and, accordingly, it is important that the highest standards are applied by, and adhered to, at all times by all parties engaged in the planning system including planning authorities, public bodies, the construction and development sector, professional practitioners, private interests and the general public in the interests of the overall common good.  A well-functioning planning system which responds to the needs and demands of society will also be critical to setting the proper planning basis for many of the actions in Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, as well as for the national planning framework and the associated ten-year national capital investment plan, both of which are quite topical at the moment and due to be published in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>The planning system impacts on many aspects of our daily lives and therefore we need to ensure that it operates in the manner intended so that it can deliver quality in planning outcomes.  The proposed establishment of the OPR, as recommended by the Mahon report, represents a fundamental reform to the planning system and that is why I regard this as an important Bill.<\/p> <p>The Bill contains 36 sections and four Parts in total and, together with four Schedules, sets out the necessary provisions to give effect to these measures and related matters.  I will now turn to the sections and Parts of the Bill in more detail.  Part 1, sections 1 to 3, inclusive, contains standard provisions dealing with such matters as the Short Title, commencement, interpretation, and provision for expenses.<\/p> <p>Part 2, comprising section 4, provides for an extensive amendment to the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, by inserting a new Part IlB therein to provide for the establishment of the office of the planning regulator.  That is the most significant part of the Bill.  This new Part, comprising the insertion of new sections 31K to 31AX into the Act of 2000 contains four chapters which provide for preliminary and general office of the planning regulator matters, the arrangements relating to the establishment, organisation and staffing of the said office, the powers relating to the evaluation and assessment of plans and strategies by the regulator, and the review of the performance of planning authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la, by the office of the planning regulator.<\/p> <p>As Part 2 of the Bill relating to the establishment of the office of the planning regulator is quite extensive, I will summarise what it proposes.  The new chapter I of the OPR provisions, namely, preliminary and general matters - comprises just one section, namely, section 31K - to provide for definitions of terms used in this Part.  New chapter II, relating to the establishment, organisation and staffing of the OPR includes new sections 31L to 31AL which provide for standard organisational and operational-type issues normally associated with statutory bodies, for example, for the chief executive of the office to be known as the planning regulator, who shall be responsible for the performance of the functions and the administration and business of the office.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The functions to be performed by the office of the planning regulator are as follows: evaluate and assess development plans and strategies and make statutory observations and recommendations on them; conduct research and arrange education and training programmes on planning matters; review the performance of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and planning authorities; make observations as it considers appropriate to the Minister on planning legislation, planning guidelines or ministerial directions; and perform any additional functions as may be assigned to it and specified by order.<br\/><br\/>Chapter II further outlines standard operational type requirements relating to the office, including the independence of the office of the planning regulator in carrying out its functions.  It outlines that the regulator has to have regard to Government policies and objectives as well as other specified matters in the performance of its functions and the review of the organisation systems and procedures used by the office of the planning regulator in performing its functions.  It outlines the appointment and terms of office of the planning regulator, with any such appointment to be approved by Government on the Minister's nomination, as well as the appointment of up to three directors to assist the planning regulator in the performance of the office's functions.<br\/><br\/>It further outlines: the appointment of staff, the remuneration of staff and the establishment of a superannuation scheme for staff; the payment of grants by the Minister to the office of the planning regulator out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for the purpose of meeting its expenses; the keeping and auditing of the accounts of the office of the planning regulator; the preparation of an annual report, also providing that the planning regulator may be called before the relevant Oireachtas committee; the provision of services, premises, equipment and other resources as necessary for the office to perform its functions; and the adoption of a code of conduct to be followed by the office of the planning regulator and its staff.  <br\/><br\/>Chapter III provides further detailed elaboration on the primary functions of the office of the planning regulator - the evaluation and assessment of development plans and regional strategies - which is provided for in new sections 31AM to 31AR.  Section 31AM provides for the office to evaluate and assess development plans and variations to development plans at all statutory stages of the plan-making process to ensure the development plans and regional strategies, as made, address relevant legislative and policy requirements.<br\/><br\/>Section 31AN provides for consequential provisions whereby the Minister either agrees or disagrees with the notice or recommendations from the office of the planning regulator and the procedures to be followed in such instances.  For instance, where the Minister does not agree with the recommendation of the regulator, the Minister in turn will be required to explain the reasons for such disagreement, lay such reasons before the Houses of the Oireachtas and publish them on the Department&rsquo;s website.  All this is in the interest of increased transparency in the local authority development plan process generally.  Sections 31 AO to 31AR provide for similar detailed procedures relating to the evaluation and assessment of local area plans and regional spatial and economic strategies.  <br\/><br\/>Chapter IV on the review of planning functions includes new sections 31AS to 31AX.  Section 3IAS provides that the office of the planning regulator may, where it considers it necessary to do so, conduct a review of a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of the systems and procedures used in the performance of their functions and may on foot of such review recommend that the Minister issues section 28 guidelines, a section 29 policy directive, or a directive under subsection 255(2) of the Planning Act to the authority concerned.  Alternatively, on foot of such a review it may recommend the appointment of a commissioner under subsection 255(4) to take over the functions of the planning authority concerned.  <br\/><br\/>Supplementary to section 31AS, section 31AT empowers the Minister to request the office of the planning regulator to undertake a review of the organisation and the systems and procedures used by a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the performance of their functions where the Minister is of the opinion that the authority concerned may not be carrying out its functions in accordance with the Act, where it is not operating in compliance with guidelines, directives and directions issued; may be applying inappropriate standards of administrative practice or otherwise acting contrary to fair or sound administration of its functions; may be applying systemic discrimination in the performance of its functions; may be operating in a manner whereby there is inappropriate risks of corruption in the conduct of its functions; or may be operating in a manner whereby there are serious diseconomies or inefficiencies in the conduct of its functions.  <br\/><br\/>Sections 31AU to 31AX outline the procedures to be followed by the office of the planning regulator on the examination of complaints made by any person to the office of the planning regulator about a planning matter, including, where considered warranted, the referral of the matter and any related documents to one or more of the Ombudsman, the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or such other State authority as may be prescribed. <br\/><br\/>Part 3 provides for a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, primarily relating to the development of the national planning framework and addressing other Mahon tribunal planning-related recommendations, including providing for a legislative basis for the development of a national planning framework, NPF, as a successor to the national spatial strategy.  It also provides for the following: the NPF shall be adopted for a period of between ten and 20 years and be reviewed every six years; national strategic development requirements shall be identified in the framework; public consultation shall be undertaken with regional assemblies, local authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, prescribed bodies and the Northern Ireland Department for Regional Development in the development of the framework; the framework shall be subject to the provisions of relevant EU environmental directives, including public consultation; and the Government shall submit the draft of a new or revised framework for the approval of the Oireachtas before it is published, and shall have regard to any resolution of the Oireachtas in the ultimate finalisation of the national planning framework.<br\/><br\/>The remaining provisions in Part 3 of the Bill largely emanate from remaining Mahon tribunal planning-related recommendations; specific actions required to be implemented under the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 strategy, a document that Senator Paudie Coffey was involved in formulating; and a number of amendments already made during the earlier deliberations on the Bill in the D&aacute;il to provide for further streamlining and enhancement of the planning legislation in general.  These include: provisions for enhanced transparency in the planning process requiring the publication of submissions on local area plans and development plans, as well as the chief executive&rsquo;s report on such submissions on the website of the relevant planning authority; the forwarding of any proposed grants of planning permission which would contravene materially a development plan or a local area plan to the relevant regional assembly for observations; and the removal of an overlap between development contributions for water infrastructure being paid for through planning permission conditions to local authorities, and to the separate collection of water infrastructure charges by Irish Water, with section 15 clarifying that any reductions in respect of development contributions as provided for in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 can only be availed of in the case of houses that have not been rented, leased, occupied or sold.  It includes the following: the provision of legislative underpinning to facilitate the introduction of eplanning, with the online submission of planning applications, appeals and associated fees; the provision of legislative underpinning for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to set fees for appeals by property owners against the application of the vacant site levy; and the provision by planning authorities of data or information for databases or national planning systems as may be specified by the Minister, for example, for use on <i>www.Myplan.ie<\/i>, the Department&rsquo;s public information website on development plans, local area plans etc.<br\/><br\/>It also provides for the payment of reduced or no fees, instead of the current &euro;20 fee, by elected Members when making submissions on planning applications, and the noting of such representations on the relevant planning file.  It would require planning authorities, when considering applications for planning permissions, to have regard to previous developments by a developer which have not been satisfactorily completed and previous convictions against the applicant on planning permissions, while also enabling planning authorities to refuse applications for planning permission taking account of such past failures.  <br\/><br\/>Other provisions contained in the Bill include that planning authorities will be enabled to refuse planning applications where persons have previously operated under a particular company name and left estates unfinished and where they subsequently apply for planning permission for a new development under a different company name.  Planning authorities will be required to process developer proposals in respect of compliance conditions relating to planning permissions within a specified timeframe.  Developers will be required to undertake mandatory pre-application consultations with the local planning authority in respect of specified larger developments before being allowed to submit a planning application.  It provides for further measures to assist in combatting land-hoarding, including giving planning authorities the possibility of applying a lesser period than the existing standard five-year default period when granting planning permissions and for the streamlining and tightening up of the procedures relating to the taking in charge of housing estates by developers.  <br\/><br\/>Part 4 contains section 15, which amends section 33 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to provide that Irish Water, in preparing a water services strategic plan or capital investment plan, shall have regard to proper planning and sustainable development in line with any development plans made under the Planning Act, in particular with the core strategies of such development plans.  This amendment is primarily intended to ensure that water services infrastructure will be provided by Irish Water where it is needed in accordance with the provisions of local development plans and core strategies.  <br\/><br\/>The remainder of the Bill comprises a number of Schedules for the purpose of making a series of miscellaneous and consequential amendments to the Planning Act arising from the provisions in the preceding parts of the Bill.  <br\/><br\/>I will bring forward a number of further amendments on Committee Stage in this House primarily relating to extending the remit of the office of the planning regulator to overseas aspects of transport strategies as opposed by Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il deliberations, aligning the timing for the making of development plans with regional, strategic and economic strategies and further miscellaneous revisions to the Planning Act which my Department is still examining.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I have outlined in some detail the main purpose and provisions of this comprehensive and wide-ranging Bill.  I thank Members on all sides of this House for their involvement here today and in the weeks ahead.  It has taken about two years for this Bill to go through the other House so it is important we facilitate it as quickly as possible for all the good planning reasons in this and for sustainable planning reasons.  I think all sides of the House will agree that this Bill is aimed at delivering a number of fundamental, important and necessary revisions to the Planning and Development Act 2000 arising from the final report of the Mahon tribunal in 2012.  In particular and as I have already indicated, the establishment of the independent office of the planning regulator will introduce a further institutional layer of sophistication and oversight of the planning system.  The establishment of this new office to take over the function of evaluating and assessing local development plans and regional strategies, to oversee generally the operation of the planning system, and to conduct reviews of operation when considered necessary is aimed at ensuring that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.  The planning system is operated in an open, transparent and impartial manner in the interests of the common good.  Accordingly, I commend this important Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive and fruitful engagement with Senators in their further deliberations on the Bill, as has been the case with the previous planning legislation we brought through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#FF00700","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The Minister of State was right when he said this Bill has been around since 2016 so it is important we get it right.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the passage of this Bill through Committee Stage but we will be putting forward amendments.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to implement a core recommendation of the Mahon tribunal, which was the establishment of the independent office of planning regulator to oversee decision-making and the planning process.  This is crucial.  However, we have a number of concerns about some of the key provisions in this Bill.  First, there are some very large omissions in the Bill, for example, if we look at the key Mahon recommendation for improving transparency in planning.  Second, some of the office of the planning regulator's functions and powers prescribed by the Bill may not be effective in overseeing the national planning strategy.  This will be crucial.  Third, we are concerned that the limitation on the powers of the office of the planning regulator is prescribed in the Bill.  Finally, we have serious reservations regarding the draft national planning framework, which this Bill would put on a statutory footing.  We must make sure that is right because it is important, but again it concerns wording and how it is done.<\/p> <p>The most important thing here is sustainable development, which is crucial to economic growth and quality of life.  It is all about quality of life.  Everyone in Ireland needs to have a proper quality of life, which will be crucial.  The office of the planning regulator must be established in line with the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  This is so important.  This Bill fails to live up fully to the full sweep of recommendations from the Mahon tribunal.  Reading through the Bill, it is clear that this is the case.  The Bill places the national planning framework on a statutory footing.  However, the draft plan put forward by the Government is completely inadequate as it neglects rural Ireland and genuinely sustainable development.  The Irish Planning Institute has criticised the legislation on the basis that the office of the planning regulator will not be fully independent of the Minister as the office can only make recommendations on local development plans.  It cannot strike down plans or variations to plans on its own authority.  That will be a problem.  The new office does not have the power to force local authorities to change their rules to comply with national policy on land use, planning or zoning decisions such as the national spatial strategy or the regional planning guidelines.  However, we believe the legislation strikes an appropriate balance between having an independent planning watchdog and maintaining democratic control and accountability over planning authorities.  The input of the Government and the elected representatives is crucial.  We believe a better approach in this Bill would be to give the office of the planning regulator the role of arbitrator between local authorities and bodies like the National Transport Authority, NTA.  We agree with the Minister that this function should be expanded and we will ensure that this is included on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>This new office will not have full police powers and the capacity to bring prosecutions.  What the Minister of State is saying is that this new body will just make recommendations and produce reports for the Ombudsman, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but it will not have its own powers to prosecute.  If the office of the planning regulator is to be effective, it must have the capacity to undertake its primary mandate to oversee planning authority decisions and investigate complaints in a timely fashion because this is all about timing.  Timing is crucial.<\/p> <p>The second main provision in this Bill is that in addition to establishing the office of the planning regulator, it places the national planning framework on a statutory footing.  I know the Minister of State said this but having this framework on a statutory footing will probably be one of the biggest issues.  Its policies on rural housing and growth targets for towns with populations below 10,000 risk bringing about decline and neglect.  This is the problem.  Rural towns really need to be looked after.<\/p> <p>Overall, I want to welcome the establishment of the office of the planning regulator in line with the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  We need regulation but this Bill may not make it an effective overseer of the national planning strategy.  My party and I also have serious concerns around the draft framework published by the Government.  The overemphasis on cities is creating the divide between those cities and rural Ireland.  There is a lot to sing loudly about in my constituency of Carlow.  As the House is aware, I am always singing its praises but we are in a great area.  We are an hour and ten minutes from Dublin.  We can develop a significant inter-regional role.  We are on the motorway network between Dublin and Waterford and are easily accessible and connected.  It is all about the links.  This is about towns like Carlow feeling they have a role in connecting the dots of the major cities.  The relevant regional assemblies must provide this connection.  The national plan cannot ignore the vital roles played by large towns in rural counties.  A person's home is his or her king and where a person lives is where his or her heart is, and that is what it is all about.  From this end, any development plan has to ensure that these towns continue to grow.  If we look at Carlow, we can see that it is a vital part of the south-east network but its population is growing faster than this plan would have us believe, which worries me.  I believe some of the figures are wrong.  As the Minister of State said, this has been ongoing for two years.  The figures are not correct and I would like the Minister of State to check that.  I have a massive concern about the figures that are being published.  If we base our plans on underestimating numbers, we will always be catching up because we will never be right if we are two years behind, as we are.<\/p> <p>I welcome the plans for investment in the south east, innovation, enterprise and education, particularly the technological university for Carlow and Waterford.  I spoke on this the other day.  Every year, the south east loses 13,000 students to the cities.  They go to the cities for third level education so it is crucial for the likes of Carlow, Waterford and Kilkenny that we have a technological university.  However, I believe Carlow town should to be identified as a regional economic growth driver.  Allocation needs to be made in respect of a strategic plan to strengthen the central spine.  We are right down by the N80.  We do not recognise how close Carlow is to Dublin.  I was very disappointed last week when the Taoiseach spoke here last week about rural Ireland.  I addressed the issue of rural Ireland, the plans and the national planning framework.  Rural Ireland is forgotten.  The Taoiseach told me not to talk down rural Ireland and I could not answer back.  I told him that we were telling him the truth.  I think that sometimes the Taoiseach and Ministers are not listening.  There are massive issues.  We are so proud of where we come from.  Those of us in rural Ireland are proud of our heritage and I am proud of Carlow but we are telling the truth.  I am saying to the Minister of State that we need investment and jobs.  I can tell him that if Carlow got three official visits from the IDA Ireland last year, it was lucky.  We need to be working on roads, infrastructure and transport, promoting small enterprises, bringing them back, and making us the link to the likes of Dublin, Waterford and Limerick.  That is what it is all about.  I believe we need to address this.  We need a framework.  That is fine and I am all for that but changes are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#HH00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

That puts us all on notice.  It is important to make that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#HH00300","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for telling me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#JJ00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>It is worth stating the Bill seeks &quot;to amend and extend the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2015 and for that purpose to establish an office, to be known as the Office of the Planning Regulator, to evaluate and carry out assessments relating to planning matters and provide observations and recommendations in relation to those matters, to conduct reviews and examinations and to conduct education and training programmes and research in relation to planning matters; to provide for the organisation and staffing of that Office&quot;.  It goes on to state more, but I want to keep the focus on the initial content that I read.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill.  This morning the Minister took a Commencement matter I had tabled and touched on many of the issues involved.  I thought that was important as the Mahon tribunal had made a number of recommendations.  The time for looking back and saying what we should have done is over.  We have learned from it.  Terrible mistakes were made which must be addressed.  We need an independent planning regulator.  The establishment of the office is to be welcomed.  It is the subject of a commitment in the programme for Government and I am glad that the Government is acting on it.  <\/p><p>The Office of the Planning Regulator must be fully and truly independent.  We will need reassurance in that regard.  The regulator must not be subordinate to the Government or the Minister of the day.  That issue is more or less being addressed but I will have to seek reassurance on it.  That is the reason I will table some amendments to the Bill as the office must be truly independent and properly resourced.  It must operate with true independence and have the necessary staff and resources that it needs.  In that way, people will have greater confidence in the planning process.  That is an important point to make.<\/p><p>I want to touch on the reserved and executive functions.  I have received a number of complaints in the past week from city councillors who have told me that they are frustrated by the executives when they request to see planning files.  In the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, on which I served, I learned from two councillors today - I have yet to validate this information, as I have yet to make contact with the director of planning - that they were told that they would not be facilitated in requesting to see particular major planning files which were to come before their committee.  If that is the case, it is wholly wrong and we need to do something about it.  I hope I will have the Minister of State's support in that regard.  I have not had the information officially clarified, but I hope to have it clarified by the close of business today.<\/p><p>I draw Minister of State's attention to an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by its political editor, Pat Leahy, on new rules aimed at curbing challenges in proceeding with key building projects.  The article suggests - only suggests - that the Government discussed these matters yesterday and that there was a suggestion that it would tighten the judicial review process and the right of people to object.  I would be wholly against this.  Good open government is healthy.  I took time today to follow and track a number of Ministers who would have discussed this matter yesterday to check their records.  I will start with myself.  The Minister of State is very familiar with the North-South interconnector project and the huge opposition to it from Ministers and Deputies from all parties and none.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#JJ00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Name them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#JJ00500","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":485,"content":"<p>That is one example.  With respect to Dublin Port, I noted that there were councillors and Ministers who had had issues in the past with development there.  I have seen other Ministers, Deputies, Senators and county councillors from all parties oppose critical infrastructural projects  I clarify that it was right and proper for them to make representations.  There was nothing underhand about it.  clearly, they have a mandate and represent their communities and have at right to make representations.  I do not want to think they are the same people in another office closing off public engagement and consultation.  The Minister of State, for whom I have a great deal of respect, knows better than most about some of the many difficult planning issues he has had to confront, as well as the dilemma in deciding what is good for the country and the economy and what is good to retain one's political seat.  I am not signalling him out in that respect, but that is the reality of the political world in which we operate.  We have to have a proper balance.<\/p> <p>We have to empower city and county councillors.  I have noticed in the year and a half I have been a Member of this House that there is a great reluctance in central government to devolve powers to local communities.  Local government forms a large part of the remit of the Minister of State's Department and I know that the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, has plans for it.  Are we truly going to empower local communities to make local decisions?  That is an important aspect.  I note that the Minister of State spoke about the payment of a reduced fee, instead of the current &euro;20 fee, by elected members.  He will recall - his officials certainly will - that in this Seanad I have referred to the role of elected members.  There was a directive from the European Union about it.  The situation in this country is outrageous.  Democratically elected representatives in local authorities, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, for that matter, have to pay to represent their communities.  I have no difficulty with that, but I stipulate that it must be open and transparent.  Representations have to be included in public files which everyone must be entitled to see.  That is very important.  It is an issue I want to have addressed and I will pursue it with the Minister of State next week.  I want absolute clarity on the role of elected members in his and every other party.  They need to have that right.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill introduced by the Minister of State.  I am very supportive of this aspect of it.  It is a very positive move.  The Minister of State spoke about education, training and research functions and mentioned that the office would conduct training, etc. for everyone.  However, there was no mention of training for city and county councillors which I want to see happen.  It is set out in section 31 on pages 9 to 11, inclusive, of the Bill.  I would be glad if the Minister clarified the matter.  If councillors want to be taken seriously, as they do, and to exercise their reserved functions, not the manager's, we need to empower them to do so.  The only way we will be able to do that is by giving them the skill set and training they need to assist them and also the power and knowledge that they can challenge the executive.  <\/p> <p>In terms of Rebuilding Ireland - I appreciate that I have ten minutes in which to contribute-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#JJ00600","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>The Senator has half a minute remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#JJ00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I will conclude on this point.

I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and his officials.  <\/p> <p>At long last this legislation is before the Oireachtas.  As the Minister of State indicated, I was involved in the early stages of its preparation.  The Bill is necessary for a number of reasons.  We have seen huge failures in planning policy, planning legislation implementation and planning decisions that were unsustainable and caused problems in various local authorities.  I will not engage in the blame game as to the reasons those problems occurred.  Some blame wrong decisions by councils and councillors who were put there and voted in by the electorate and citizens of the State.  There were also problems with officials who made bad decisions or who at times might have turned a blind eye.  The Mahon tribunal reported and one of its main recommendations was the establishment of an independent office of planning regulator.  It is welcome that at long last we have the legislation.  Its introduction is timely.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, with his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is due to announce in the coming weeks the new national planning framework.  It has been the subject of much discussion in the context of regional balance and rural provision.  I express my support for it.  I have, however, raised issues about it, as I was quite entitled to do, at the Oireachtas joint committee which deals with environmental issues and also within the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party at which we have had robust discussions on it and the direction we want to see Ireland move in the next ten, 20 and 30 years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I strongly support the idea that we have regional balance as a counter weight to the strong performance of the economy in Dublin and its hinterlands.

We do so by implementing the hierarchy of planning and supporting strong regional cities that are driving the economy in terms of job creation.  I respect Senator Murnane O'Connor's views on Carlow.  I think she mentioned Carlow about 100 times in her contribution, as she always does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#JJ00900","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I want to make sure the Minister of State does not forget it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#KK00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I have no problem with that.

The Government is correct to identify the five cities around Ireland that it will grow and enhance and which will double in population in the next number of years.  Towns such as Carlow, Kilkenny and Clonmel in the south east can be the next priority in terms of investment.  That is the way to do it.  If we spread our resources too thinly and dilute the infrastructure right across the country, we do not work efficiently and generate value for money from the taxpayer's investment.  We must have a robust, sustainable planning system in the country and that is the reason the National Planning Framework: Ireland 2040 Our Plan is so important.<\/p> <p>As we engage with the National Planning Framework: Ireland 2040 Our Plan, it is timely that we have an independent office of the planning regulator that will oversee the implementation of Government policy in terms of regional and local development.  The national planning framework should trickle down to the Regional Assemblies and county and city developments plans and local area plans as well.  There are many stakeholders involved in the delivery of sustainable county and local development plans.  As we know, the stakeholders are the local authorities and the executive management but, as Senator Boyhan said, it is the councillors, the elected members, who have reserve functions.  We need to see consistency and sustainability.  We will not have that unless we have full transparency and oversight.  The new office of the planning regulator will bring that benefit.  We must learn from the past mistakes, and bring oversight and transparency and allow alignment and co-ordination of our various development plans so that they are coherent and sustainable.<\/p> <p>The office of the planning regulator will have oversight and have responsibility in terms of the review of the systems and procedures in the planning process.  That includes the local authorities which are the planning authorities but also An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Many of us, as public representatives, will have had experience of engagement with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is timely that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be made accountable in terms of its procedures.  There is much criticism, much of it justified, of the long delays in An Bord Plean&aacute;la coming to decisions for critical infrastructure and otherwise.  I do not lay that at the door of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but there are various reasons for it.  When there are objections, either frivolous or genuine, as the Minister knows, the problem is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has time and again deferred decisions to the real frustration of the development of critical infrastructure.  That must be addressed, and I certainly hope that this Bill will address it in terms of oversight and review of the efficiency of the way An Bord Plean&aacute;la works.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan suggested that the office of the planning regulator should not be accountable to the Minister.  I would argue against that, as a democrat.  I know that Senator Boyhan is a democrat as well.  One could apply that at local authority level, for example.  Does one leave planning decisions to the county manager or is the planning function of that council the responsibility of the councillors?  I believe in a democracy.  The Minister is the elected member of the Government to oversee everything that happens during the term of that Government.  It is correct that the office of the planning regulator reports to the Minister.  The Minister has invested in him significant powers in terms of the protection of the interests of the citizens, but under the terms of this Bill, the Minister is accountable.  If, for any reason, the Minister does not agree with the recommendations of the independent regulator, he or she must justify his or her decision and lay down the reasons before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In a democracy, the buck should stop with the Minister and not with some bureaucrat.  I disagree with Senator Boyhan on that point.  I know where he is coming from in terms of wanting the office of the planning regulator to have full independence but we are a democratic State and we have a Government.  The Government of the day is ultimately accountable to the citizen.  If the decision-making of the Minister of the day is incorrect, he or she should be held to account by the Government and the citizens who put him or her there.<\/p> <p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Members stated that the office of the planning regulator does not have the powers of enforcement or sanction.  They want the office of the planning regulator to be judge, jury and executioner.  I do not agree with that view either.  In the Bill, the independent regulator has the power to call in the Ombudsman, the Garda and the Standards in Public Office Commission in instances of possible corruption or malpractice.  Those agencies have the relevant authority and powers to prosecute where any malpractice or corruption is found.<\/p> <p>The Minister has prepared good legislation in that respect.  There should always be a healthy tension in regard to the creation of development plans between the elected members and the professional planners in the local authorities.  The elected members come from the communities with a mandate from the citizens who reside in the communities and they know best what the communities want.  We cannot have unrestrained development without proper co-ordination in the hierarchy of planning.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill and look forward to the debate on all Stages of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#KK00700","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome the chance to speak on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, particularly because the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments dealt with issues of corruption in the planning process.  It is disappointing that it is taken so long for Government to implement some of its recommendations.<\/p><p>I strongly agree with Senator Boyhan&rsquo;s point on public engagement.  I ask the Minister to strengthen the provision and not dismiss it and to allow the public to express ownership of their area and have their say.  As a councillor, I was a bit shocked when I had to represent people and pay the fee for making representations for local people.  We need to bring the Minister around to our viewpoint.  This is a modern, progressive and a positive provision which will ensure co-operation between the planners, the public and the proposers of the development.  It is not negative.  We need to be much more inclusive of the public viewpoint, after all it is their local area.<\/p><p>As argued by my party colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin,<b><\/b>in the D&aacute;il, it is disappointing that many aspects of the report&rsquo;s key recommendations remain unimplemented.  It is also important to point out, given the length of time since the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments was established, that the debate on how best to tackle corruption in public life has moved on and Government action on these issues and the issues raised in the report of that tribunal should not be limited to just its own recommendation.  In light of this, I am concerned by the absence of several key recommendations from the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments in this legislation.<\/p><p>While the issue of directly electing members of regional authorities has been deferred, does the Government have any proposals for improving the accountability or transparency of this body in planning related matters?  That was a key concern of  Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, the Mahon tribunal.  Why has the Government ruled out using an independent appointments process for appointments to what was the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII?  Contrary to claims made previously, the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal on increasing transparency in the planning process has not been fully implemented in this Bill.  The Bill does not address key proposals.  I would like the Minister to say why this is the case and whether we can address these matters.  Measures relating to decisions by councillors in contravention of the advice of officials and declarations of political donations by planning applicants remain unaddressed.  These are key recommendations of the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments and this is what shocked the public.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When I sat again as a councillor in south Dublin, several Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors were named by the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments as being corrupt.  Surely this needs to be addressed urgently?  Politicians are negatively viewed by the public and ably assist in this negative view.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider these important issues and to either table his own amendments on Committee Stage or to be open to those from Opposition parties.  This is not a criticism of the Minister of State.  I am sure he is very good.  It is a point about how some of these issues were reported previously.  It is not good enough to produce progress reports as was previously the case, stating that recommendations are supported in principle or being progressed to some degree.<\/p><p>The second area is the power to act.  The real substance of the Bill is the creation of a planning regulator.  While the training and research functions are undoubtedly welcome, it cannot in any way be described as an independent body with the powers of regulation and enforcement as recommended by the Mahon tribunal.  It is arguable that, rather than enforcement powers being transferred from the Minister to the independent regulator, we actually end up with the contrary of what the Mahon tribunal recommended, namely, increased powers being given to the Minister.  That is against both the letter and the spirit of the tribunal's recommendations.<\/p><p>I need the Minister of State to clarify an aspect of the miscellaneous provisions in the Bill, most notably relating to the national planning framework, NPF.  An Oireachtas vote must be called for in the final draft of the national planning framework.  Sinn F&eacute;in has engaged with the NPF consultation process from the start and made two detailed submissions articulating our concerns about the draft plan.  There were huge gaps in the last document, namely, in the north west of the country, and there was much vagueness on the North-South dimension of the plan.  There must be a much stronger all-Ireland focus, especially in the context of the impact of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#KK00800","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#LL00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>It is unclear what the procedure is for putting the NPF on a statutory footing.

Our discussion of this Bill is overshadowed by the announcement today that the Government intends to bring forward further amendments to the Planning and Development Act.  The stated purpose of these amendments will be to limit access to justice in planning cases.  This would be contrary to both the Constitution and the Aarhus Convention, to which Ireland is a signatory.  The fact that this negative proposal has apparently been approved by the Cabinet is shameful.  I hope that it goes no further and is never brought before the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>To deal with this Bill, I welcome the establishment of the planning regulator.  The current system for establishing coherence between development plans at various levels has been found to be inadequate.  An independent planning regulator is an important reform to address this.  The proposed role of the regulator in reviewing the performance of planning functions is especially welcome.  It is particularly needed in the area of enforcement as many citizens and environmental advocates report great difficulties in getting planning authorities to perform their enforcement functions effectively.<\/p> <p>The results of inadequate planning enforcement affect both the public as a whole and the purchasers of houses and apartments built to low standards.  I hope the independent regulator will particularly focus on ensuring local authorities are effective enforcement authorities.  We should also make use of this Bill to make further important amendments to planning legislation and I will be proposing amendments accordingly.<\/p> <p>Part of the reason for the planning regulator is the inadequacy of the current system in achieving consistency between plans at different levels.  The phrase \"have regard to\" has been found to mean very little in planning law.  As a result it was replaced with the phrase \"be consistent with\" and it is this test which public authorities are required to apply and the planning regulator will implement.  The same phrase is used in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  Planning authorities are required to \"have regard to\" the national objective of transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and environmentally  sustainable economy.  This phrase has little to no effect.<\/p> <p>We have made very little progress in planning for the low carbon transition.  It is quite the opposite.  Development plans and planning decisions continue to lock us in to high energy use and fossil fuel-based solutions.  Therefore, we should use this Act to require that planning decisions of all types are consistent with the national transition objective.  I ask the Minister of State to bring forward an amendment to this effect.  Climate change is a shared priority for all of us and the Government has already acknowledged that Ireland is a climate laggard.  The Taoiseach referred to that recently.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response to this.<\/p> <p>The difficulties with inadequate enforcement I referred to apply to both planning enforcement and building control enforcement.  The two systems have failed us gravely in recent years with serious consequences, especially for owners of defective houses.  I believe part of the solution is to have them interlink and support each other.  Therefore, we should amend the planning code to make explicit that \"satisfactory completion\" as defined in the Act includes compliance of all houses with the building regulations.  Provision for financial guarantees is an important tool in effective enforcement.  We should provide that all developments of two or more houses should include financial guarantees.<\/p> <p>In 2015 the European Court of Justice clarified that the Water Framework Directive precludes the granting of permissions which may cause a deterioration in the status of a water body.  This is, of course, directly effective in Ireland.  However, Irish planners do not refer to European Court of Justice judgments as part of their daily work.  The Water Framework Directive would be much better applied in practice if the principle set out in the 2015 Weser judgment was clearly stated in the Planning and Development Act.<\/p> <p>The provision in section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, introduced by the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Alan Kelly, enabling a highly centralised planning policy without consultation or consideration should be deleted.  We should also provide that Part 8 applications are required to contain the same information that an ordinary planning application for the same development would have to contain.<\/p> <p>Some local authorities have identified what appears to be a drafting error in section 208 of the Planning and Development Act.  It appears to require maintenance of those rights of way listed in plans at the time when the section was commenced.  At least one council has formed the legal view that the obligation to maintain rights of way does not apply to any rights of way listed subsequent to the commencement of section 208.  I understand the Department has details of this but we would be happy to provide them if required.  For the sake of clarity, I think an appropriate amendment should be included in the Bill.<\/p> <p>I will refer back to Senators Murnane O'Connor and Coffey with regard to the national planning framework and the importance of regional balance, particularly outside the greater Dublin area.  My own region, Waterford, has been on the back foot and it is imperative for the growth of the south east for a city such as Waterford to have the support and infrastructure to enable it to be the engine for the south east.<\/p> <p>I look forward to more discussions on the Bill.  We need to take significant steps to ensure that the planning system delivers on the transition to a low carbon environmentally sustainable economy and society.  Our role as legislators is to ensure the legal framework within which planning operates places sustainability at the centre of the planning system.

I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept an amendment on it on Committee Stage.  This concerns planning itself.  The regulator will have many powers but will not have power relating to the regulation of planners.  The Irish Planning Institute is very concerned about the matter.  At the moment anyone can call himself or herself a planner.  I can act as a planner.  As I said, anyone can.  There is no protection for the public.  The institute wants the situation that pertains to other professions to apply, that is, that there would be a register and a council to oversee proper training, qualifications and standards.  It would also have the power to sanction, advise and admonish and to remove a practitioner's licence.  It would, therefore, need to be the licensing authority as well.  It would be independent of Government, as is the Medical Council, An Bord Altranais, CORU, etc.<\/p><p>This is critically important and very much in the public interest.  At the moment people are vulnerable to those who call themselves planners but do not have appropriate qualifications and who are not in breach of any law or regulation.  I, therefore, want us to take the opportunity to put in place a proper register of planners so that we can all feel protected when getting the service we require and knowing it is a quality service.<\/p><p>Last night I was at a meeting in Donabate attended by more than 100 local people who are concerned with planning issues in the area.  They welcomed that new houses will be built but they want sustainable development.  They want to be assured around issues such as flood plains, transport, roads, rail, schools, etc.  They are also concerned about enforcement, which other Senators mentioned.  Currently, we have a 750 cm pathway outside one of our local schools with heavy trucks and lorries going by it during school opening and closing hours.  This was prohibited under the planning permission given to the Central Mental Hospital.  I am not sure if these trucks relate to this development or to other developments but this is a public health and safety issue.  There is a danger of a serious injury or fatality occurring and it is a major concern for people.  Enforcement is a big issue and it can be addressed during the passage of the Bill.  I am sure the Minister of State will take it on board.<\/p><p>I have limited time but I will mention quickly the national planning framework.  I have already raised in the House my concerns about unforeseen consequences for places such as Fingal and Swords that will be limited in their development and the ratio of brownfield sites to greenfield sites.  We have very few in Fingal which means that very few houses may be built on greenfield sites.  That is one interpretation we could take.  The other unintended consequence would be prices in Dublin city driving up the price of brownfield sites and making houses even more unaffordable in Dublin.  We do not want to see that.<\/p><p>We need to speak up for Dublin as well.  Without being parochial about it, we need development throughout the country.  If we consider Dublin Airport and the &euro;8.3 billion that it contributes to our economy, and remember that for every job,  nine other jobs are created, it has the planning permission for four buildings.  Some 4,000 office workers will move in there.  Where will they want to live?  They will not all want to live in Dublin.  They will want to live in Fingal and in the area near to their work.  This makes sense socially and community-wise and from a green economy perspective given that there will be a shorter distance to travel to work.  We do not want unforeseen circumstances strangling Dublin Airport and what is an important part of our economy and an economic contributor not just to Fingal but to the entire country.<\/p><p>There could not be a more important time for us to incorporate this amendment on a register for planners.  We are speaking about a capital plan of in excess of &euro;110 billion; we are considering a national planning framework; and Rebuilding Ireland is telling us that we need to build 500 new homes over the coming years.  This is a time when IBEC and the ESRI state that as many as 800,000 new homes are required given an expected population increase of 1 million to 1.6 million, depending on the source.<\/p><p>With plans for ever-increasing density within Dublin city, proper planning of amenities and, in particular, green spaces will be essential.  We will need these well qualified and experienced planners to be available to us to achieve the best outcome.  These are people who will be innovative and will think outside the box.  They will get the best for our communities from our new buildings and developments.  I hope that the Minister of State will work with me and I look forward to working with his officials on the amendment so that we do not miss this golden opportunity.  It is a public interest issue.  The public needs protection from unscrupulous individuals who portray themselves as planners when they are not.  We need to protect people from substandard planning practice.<\/p><p>I will finish by stating that we need a registrar with the power of sanction, including loss of licence.  This will also ensure standards in training and practice and a code of ethics.  Those in the Irish Planning Institute want it and so do other planners.  It is in everyone's interest that the reputation of planners, many of whom are excellent people, is protected and the public is protected as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#LL00500","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and it is good to see him here.

As a Minister of State, I had the privilege to travel the country from one end to the other and I saw small towns which were destroyed by poor planning decisions.

Despite being told that it would destroy the town centre, councillors put shopping centres outside town centres for their own personal and greedy reasons.  We also saw it at a national level.  As with \"The Late Late Show\", there was something for everyone in the audience in our national spatial strategy and decentralisation.  Senator Victor Boyhan is absolutely correct that decentralisation is not about moving jobs from one place to another; it is about moving the decision-making powers closer to the citizen and away from centralised government.

Unfortunately, all our citizens will not be able to benefit immediately and it will be a matter of time.  It will only happen if priorities are made and decisions are made clearly and transparently.  I worry when we hear about national plans being torn up at the Cabinet table, with something put together to give something to everybody in the audience.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister of State well and he has served the country and his county well.  Please do not go back to the days of old, where we tried to ensure there was something for everybody in the audience.  In the end, everybody in the audience will pay for it dearly.  We have done it over a number of decades and generations.  Please let us not go back to the bad old days.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill was worked on by numerous Ministers, including the Minister of State before us and Deputies Willie Penrose, Jan O'Sullivan, Alan Kelly and Eoghan Murphy, as well as Senator Coffey when he was Minister of State.  This will have a long-term and lasting effect on the country.  I do not like everything in it and it can be improved.  It has passed through the D&aacute;il and it must go through the Seanad at a reasonably quick pace to ensure it can have an influence on what is happening today.<\/p> <p>The idea that public representatives have to pay to represent the electorate through planning decisions is wrong.  An Taisce does not have to make a &euro;20 payment for an observation about a planning application.  Our councillors, elected by the people, should not have to pay &euro;20 to make an observation.  I would like to see this element of the 2000 Bill changed to allow councillors to make an observation without paying.  There is an argument that Senators and Deputies should not have to pay it either.  I ask the Minister of State at least to look at making that amendment.<\/p> <p>Let us make the decisions for the future of all our citizens and all our children.  Let us not go back to the times of Parlon country and the corrupt era.  I do not say this easily with regard to what went on in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  We must make the right decisions for citizens.  Sometimes those will be tough and we will pay the ultimate price by losing a seat.  We got into politics to make a lasting impact on this country so let us make the right decisions.  We should not worry about how the electorate would feel and make the right decisions by our country.  We should stand by transparent planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#NN00500","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and acknowledge the importance of this Bill.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 is very important and it deals with matters left over from the Mahon tribunal that must be addressed.  Most of the issues have already been mentioned by Senators this afternoon but I have some comments.<\/p> <p>The first regards the timelines of county development and national plans and how these are tied together.  The Minister of State mentioned that there should be some synergy between the plans so they can work together and it should relate to elections as well.  There was a bizarre case in Cork in 2014 when a council changed halfway through a county development plan.  Between two public consultation phases there were 38 new councillors coming in and making very important decisions.  With the deepest respect to everybody involved, their job was impossible as a result.  They missed much of the public consultation phase over 18 months and halfway through the process they were stuck with a very complicated and intense proposal.  Most people have experience of the process and I have gone through it on three different occasions.<\/p> <p>We need to step back from this and tie elections of councillors to the process so they can be properly trained and informed.  When they have to make key decisions, they will then have the ability to know what they can and cannot do.  They will also understand the process.  In previous cases, they were not aware of the process.  If there are 55 councillors and 38 come in halfway through a process, it becomes very unwieldy.  There is a body of work we must examine to tie in the sequence of local elections, which happen in a five-year cycle, to these plans.  That will bring about a more coherent plan that can deliver better for the people.<\/p> <p>There are some very important aspects of this Bill that must be welcomed.  For example, there is the matter of developers involved with unfinished housing estates.  This is a very important part of the legislation as, unfortunately, we have seen rogue builders over the past decade, if not more, and they can emerge again.  These developers are coming back on stream so we must have the ability to weed them out and ensure that when it comes to developing our villages and towns, we do not see the mistakes we saw before.  We must look at their reputations.  If the builders do not have the appropriate reputations, local authorities must be strong.  Local authorities have compulsory purchase order powers in legislation, which are probably the strongest in the State, but they do not want to use them.  The executives do not want to use the stick that is required in some cases.  It is important that the Minister of State's Department leads by example to ensure that rogue builders can be taken to task.  We have seen from time to time local authorities taking the easy option instead of the hard path.  We must work on that.  If we can ensure developers are aware that local authorities will be strong, we will have sustainable development.<\/p> <p>Another matter mentioned by many Senators is the fees attached to local authorities.  There is the proposal to reduce the fee for public representatives, mainly councillors, and it is important that local representatives be given the opportunity to make a submission free of charge like organisations such as An Taisce.  I do not wish to put the Minister of State on the spot but when was the last time the fee for planning permission was changed?  It must be a decade, if not more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#NN00600","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":515,"content":"<p>It was 1998.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#NN00700","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>That is nearly two decades.

I know the Senator wants to push for Carlow.  Everyone wants to push their own county.  It is important though that everyone realises that we have to make national and regional decisions.  To allay fears, do not always believe what is written about Cabinet meetings.  The Cabinet has a very clear understanding.<\/p> <p>This is a national planning framework.  It is something we have worked on through various Ministers.  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, has worked hard on it for almost the past year.  There have been serious rounds of consultation with the wider public.  There has been strong representation from all Departments and agencies on the board bringing forward that plan.  I have been at those meetings myself and around the country with this over the past 16 to 18 months.  There has been a lot of consultation.  We have had debates here, in local authority chambers and regional debates.  All that debate will be reflected in the final plan.<\/p> <p>I hear a lot of commentary from people in here and outside about what is in it and what is not.  People are commenting on a draft plan.  That has evolved a lot over the past five or six months, and rightly so.  That is why we had the consultation, why I went to the regional assemblies and why the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has been engaging directly with people.  We are doing that through our officials in the Department for a reason.  That is to get everyone's input so we can all buy into the plan and agree with it.  The hysteria I have had to listen to in recent weeks is not reflected in the most up-to-date plan.  It is a plan that will save rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>I am disappointed to hear politicians in recent weeks saying that this plan is going to ruin rural Ireland.  It will save rural Ireland, as well as put our cities on a footing to be able to compete on an international level, where they should be able to compete.  I refer not just to Dublin but to Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford as well.  If we are going to have real job creation for a real future for this country, we have to be able to compete on an international stage and not just from county to county.  I want to be very clear on that as well.<\/p> <p>There is concern that I am bringing this Bill through and not the senior Minister.  I know it not meant personally.  We take this Bill very seriously and so does the Minister, Deputy Murphy.  I started the Bill in the House before and I was asked to continue with it.  It is something I am glad to do because, like the Senators, I have been a member of a local authority and I have seen bad planning.  Apart from the people we represent and apart from driving around this country daily and seeing bad planning, I witnessed bad planning as a councillor as well.  I had to fight against it.  When I came in as a young councillor I had to make some important planning decisions.  I did not always go with the grain, I went against the grain.  That was difficult.  We want to make it possible for councillors of all parties in future to stand up, be strong and make the right planning decisions.  The office of the planning regulator will help them do that job and will oversee that.  The independence of that is so important.<\/p> <p>We have also built in accountability.  It is important there is still democratic accountability.  That is why the office of the planning regulator will be able to bring forward suggested directions to the Minister who then has to make the final decision.  At the moment, the Minister, which is me currently, makes those decisions without any regulator or transparency.  We have about 300 local area plans coming to my Department on which our officials work daily and then they come to our desk for decision.  That will change once we have the office of the planning regulator.  It will bring those suggestions to the desk of future Ministers.  The future Minister, whoever it is going to be, will make those decisions in a full transparent way in front of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is important and it is not there at the moment.  I assure the Members I try to make the right decisions on behalf of everybody.  Some are discussed in this House.  However, the regulator will take the lead on this and bring forward those suggested directions to local authorities on all plans not following national guidelines or proper planning.  I believe this is the right system we are putting into place.  My time spent as a councillor has given me the real desire to get this Bill through because I have seen bad planning.  We have all seen it and it is wrong.  We have to correct that.  I think we will get most of that right in the future.<\/p> <p>The national planning framework is also part of that discussion.  I refer to getting proper planning dealing with all the issues the Senators have raised into the national plan.  I think we can achieve that.  I hope both Houses of the Oireachtas will accept and buy into the plan.  I hope they understand that it is a genuine attempt to plan this country for the next 15 and 20 years up to 2040.  It is right that as politicians we make long-term decisions.  That is why it will be backed by a capital plan of &euro;110 billion to &euro;115 billion of taxpayers' money, money that we have to spend.  It is right that they are co-ordinated because in the past we have had national plans that nobody followed and were thrown to one side.  There was no backup and no political backup.  That was wrong and that is what we are trying to correct with this Ireland 2040 national planning framework.  I believe we can do that as well as we go along.<\/p> <p>Amendments have been suggested.  We are happy to look at all amendments over the next couple of weeks and tease them through with the Senators.  We had that chance in the D&aacute;il.  It is legislation for all the years ahead and not just this national planning framework.  Most importantly, it does reflect the Mahon tribunal recommendations, that is, the planning recommendations.  It does not deal with all of the recommendations of the tribunal because it should not.  This is a planning Bill.  Some of those recommendations are already dealt with in other legislation.  Some are for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  They are not for a planning Bill.  However, I understand the point made and I will certainly pass it on.  We cannot deal with them all in this Bill.  We are dealing with the recommendations that are relevant to planning.  That is what we are trying to do here and to correct that as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#OO00800","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":525,"content":"<p>In accordance with the order of the day we must conclude at 5 p.m to go on to the next item.

It is about giving confidence in the planning system.  Senator Boyhan is absolutely right on that.  The work we do in bringing forward a planning amendment like this, reflecting the Mahon tribunal's recommendations, is to give confidence in the system.  It is to give people a guarantee they can trust the planning system.  They have been let down by that system in the past through a combination of faults.  There is no use in us trying to debate who, what, where and why.  It is about correcting it and putting in place a new culture and system to protect that.  I believe there have been great improvements when it comes to planning decisions over recent years.  However, this is to reinforce that.<\/p> <p>In respect of commentary about suggested changes coming through Cabinet restricting people's ability to object, that is not the intention.  It is to bring some clarity to the timelines.  EU law and our own laws reflect people's right to object.  There is no issue with that whatsoever.  However, it is how long that process can take.  Anyone wanting to make investment plans needs certainty around the timelines of planning, whether it is community groups or a company.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are currently not getting that with planning decisions.  That uncertainty leads to a lack of investment in some cases, which can have a knock-on effect in a community in terms of job creation.  With this Bill we are trying to bring more clarity and certainty to the timelines involved.  That is what it is about.  It is not to restrict anyone's ability to object or to raise a concern, as that is important.  There must be the ability to do that in any proper planning system.  We respect and acknowledge that.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly suggested a proposed amendment in which there is a great deal of merit.  We had a similar discussion on the recognition of accountants when I dealt with the Companies Bill.  We have also had a discussion on the recognition of architects.  Having such a register can cause difficulty for people in the business.  However, having a register of planners is worth examining and we will do so.  I will not give the Senator an answer to his suggestion today but we will debate the matter when we deal with that amendment next week.  Any amendments to the Bill will be welcomed and we will tease them out.  In general, I understand the necessity to have a register of the various qualifications that people have.  This is also an issue in the medical profession.  It brings complications and it is never straightforward.  I have had to deal with the situation with respect to architects, which has left people with good qualifications shut out of the system.  Any such amendment would have to be examined and teased out properly but we will certainly do that.<\/p><p>The national planning framework is about prioritising investment and making sure the work we do is having an impact.  That is what we are trying to do here.  Decisions will be made, with which not everybody will be happy, but that will prove the planning system is right in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of the maintenance of rights of way.  I would be very interested to examine that.  We had a discussion on that issue in the D&aacute;il.  The Senator's legal advice was not raised there because I think Deputy Eamon Ryan missed getting to do that.  He might have raised it if he had the chance to do so at the time.  I know there was some consideration of that and we would willing to tease out that issue with the Senator to make sure we get that right.  We can only protect them if they are mentioned in the plan.  Other amendments were proposed when we debated the Bill in the D&aacute;il but they did not deal with rights of way.  Rights of way are not referenced in a development plan.  Such provision is easier said than done.  They have to be in that plan.  I would interested to see the Senator's advice on that issue.<\/p><p>On building control and regulations, we have very strong building control regulations in place.  The changes made by previous Ministers in the previous Government are right.  We have a very strong building control system that gives people greater protection.  We want to keep it as strong as it is.  Part of my job is dealing with defective properties.  I am looking at situations in Mayo in regard to pyrite and mica.  We cannot have defective properties continuing to be built and builders turning their back on regulations.  However, I do not believe they are doing that.  The certification process that is in place catches and deals with that.  We have a higher quality coming through the system.  That issue is not included in this Bill but we are dealing with it and the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 is a very strong measure in that space.  We are always looking to see how we can improve matters.<\/p><p>Rather than responding to other matters Senators raised, on which I can come back to them individually, I recommend that Bill proceeds to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#OO01000","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1517999400,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 31; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Gabrielle McFadden and John O'Mahony; N\u00edl, Senators M\u00e1ire Devine and Paul Gavan.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#PP00400","aye":["1379","1409","1380","1423","1391","1384","1376","1422","1416","1390","1414","1383","1424","1428","1415","1412","1417","1430","1429","1393","1386","1375","1425","1401","1395","1426","1397","1385","1410","1421","1399"],"nay":["1378","1388","1389","1400","1377","1413"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":529,"content":"<p>One vote had to be altered because Senator Martin Conway inadvertently pressed the wrong button.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#RR00100","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":530,"content":"<p>The right button.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#RR00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":531,"content":"<p>That is what I am being told.

First, I will address the necessity for this legislation and then analyse the changes I have proposed to make it more operational and flexible.  I also will address the concerns the Government might have in order to demonstrate the standards the Bill will meet for it.<\/p><p>I will begin by talking about the need for the legislation.  My proposal is nothing new.  In 2011 the programme for Government not only condemned the practice of admitting children to adult psychiatric units but also committed to ending the practice.  The promise had been prompted two years earlier when the Mental Health Commission published a code of practice stating this practice should be phased out by 2011.  What has happened during the past the seven years?  The Minister of State's answer will be, &quot;Nothing&quot;.  The whole point of the legislation is to ensure the safety and welfare of the child.  Sadly, there is inertia and almost apathy on the part of the HSE in its attitude to mental health services for children which is reinforced by the absence of political will on the part of the Government.  We are now at a stage where the HSE, the Government and some external organisations are immune to the plight of children.  The much used excuse that there are no beds available might seem plausible to the outside world.  While it might seem unpleasant but plausible, the truth is that child admissions to adult units occur even when there are beds available.  I will refer to an article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>in June 2016 in which the findings of the Mental Health Commission were disclosed and it was stated categorically that on all dates when children had been admitted to adult psychiatric units there were beds available in CAMHS.  <\/p><p>I will refer to even more recent events.  Last week the President of the High Court considered he had no choice but to admit a child to an adult psychiatric unit, even though, according to <i>The Irish Times, <\/i>the child had no mental illness.  He also sanctioned the sedating of the child.  What are we doing to children?  It was once said the level of compassion and humanity in a country could be measured by how its government treated the most vulnerable.  Does the Minister of State know how the Government is treating the most vulnerable?  I will remind him, if he does not know the answer to the question.  <\/p><p>Between January and May 2017 a total of 44 children were admitted to adult psychiatric units, an increase of eight on the figure for the same period in the previous year.  When questioned and challenged on these figures, the HSE often cites a decline in the appalling numbers of admissions since 2014, but it leaves out one very important fact which is that the numbers fluctuate.  It has nothing to do with its concerted efforts; the decrease in numbers in some years is a pure fluke.  For several months the state-of-the-art CAMHS unit in Dublin was closed.  The excuse for the closure was that there were no staff available.  What happened to the children who needed help during those months?  Did anyone in the Minister of State's Department inquire or ask that very difficult question?  Where will children go now?  There is a CAMHS unit on the Minister of State's own turf, but he should think of children in the Wexford-Waterford area.  He should think of a 14-year-old child who was placed in the adult psychiatric unit in Waterford hospital last year.  The unit is known by staff and patients as the dungeon because it is in the bowels of the hospital.  The HSE has often stated the admission of children to adult units is a temporary measure and that usually their stay is only for a couple of days, but 42 days later the child in question was still in the dungeon, believing it was a punishment for being suicidal.  What is far worse is that the same child was again admitted to the dungeon during the Christmas period.  We talk about the best interests of the child, but where are his or her best interests in this scenario?  I could tell the Minister of State lots of stories and I am sure he could tell me many, but I do not want to depress the country.  <\/p><p>I will address the wording of the amendment to the Bill which was initiated in 2016.  I will talk about the journey of the Bill.  With regard to the most important piece of the original amendment to section 14A, I agree that I had adopted a very rigid and inflexible blanket approach whereby no child was to be admitted to any adult psychiatric unit.  I met the Minister of State and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and listened.  They both said categorically that they supported the policy and standards behind the legislation, but they made it very clear that it needed to be more flexible.  Their concern was that it could lead to children being refused treatment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joan Freeman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2483\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2483&amp;amp;pid=JoanFreeman&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I listened to the Minister of State and went about getting expert advice from all the stakeholders, asking them what would be the best way to word this Bill, not only for the sake of the people who work at the coalface but also for the welfare of our children.  Although it pains me to have any debate to even consider a child could still end up in an adult psychiatric unit, I listened to those experts.  The amendment reflects the recommendations of an expert review group:  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Section 4 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following subsections after subsection (3):&quot;(4) An admission order made in respect of a child to an approved centre shall only be made where the consultant psychiatrist making the admission order is satisfied of the following:<blockquote>(a) all possible avenues to source accommodation in a child inpatient unit have been exhausted;<br \/><br \/>(b) the child's environment is suitable having regard to their age and needs;<br \/><br \/>(c) the approved centre has sufficient policies and protocols in place relating to the admission of a child; and<br \/><br \/>(d) age-appropriate facilities are in place including appropriate accommodation designated for children which is segregated by age and gender from adults.<\/blockquote>(5) Subsequent to the admission the following steps shall be taken:<blockquote>(a) the approved centre shall carry out a risk assessment in respect of the child's admission to an adult unit; and<br \/><br \/>(b) the approved centre will conduct a review of the child's on-going treatment at an adult unit every twenty-four hours.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>In this amendment, I acknowledge child admissions into an adult psychiatric unit may need to take place in certain circumstances.  If it happens, we must ensure important safeguards are in place and to keep the welfare of the child central at all times.<br\/><br\/>My proposal is a basic standard of care.  It is the very least we can do for these children who are already in acute distress and who are entrusted to our care.  Many of these children will tell one that the experience in an adult psychiatric unit is far worse than whatever mental health issues they are experiencing.  We often look across the water for examples of what actually works.  England, with a population more than ten times the size of the Irish population, changed its legislation in 2010 because it saw it as its duty of care to provide age appropriate accommodation for patients under the age of 18 suffering from a mental disorder.<br\/><br\/>I am not trying to reinvent the wheel with this Bill.  It reflects the strong and urgent recommendations of the Mental Health Commission.  It also embraces Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by the Government 25 years ago, which states &quot;every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults&quot;.  Despite these urgent recommendations and considerations, the practice still continues.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State and the Department know this amendment is the best possible solution to an incredibly contentious and a wholly sorrowful issue concerning our children.  In the past two weeks, we saw how the Government neglected our children who were sexually abused for the past 20 years by only recently enforcing mandatory reporting.  This is thanks to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  For the past seven years, the cries of the children placed in adult psychiatric units have been ignored.  How many more years do we have to allow them to suffer because the Government fails to act?<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State will suggest some additions to the Bill.  However, this should not become another exercise in kicking the can down the road.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, he has the compassion and power to avoid it.  For the sake of 1.2 million children in our country, a quarter of whom will need assistance, will the Minister of State become their champion and move this Bill to the next Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#RR01200","speaker":"1428","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.<\/p> <p>I commend Senator Freeman for tabling this amendment to the Mental Health Act.  It is imperative the House supports it and sees it through.  Last year, for two days, Members, as well as the Minister of State, heard from parents and professionals on this issue in the House in a public consultation process.  We heard the heartache of parents, as well as professionals, trying to access mental health care, as well as the appropriate care, for their children.  It was noted in the report from the public consultation process.<\/p> <p>We have never prioritised our children&rsquo;s mental health care needs.  Now we are quite surprised at the amount of well-being and mental health issues which have developed over the past generation or so.  Accordingly, we need to insert into our public services the assistance and support required to nurture our children, to allow them to grow up confident and to be able to cope with, if not free from, distress or other mental health and well-being issues.<\/p> <p>A Vision for Change was published in 2006.  I am always moaning about it as most of it has not been implemented.  Adult and old age psychiatry services are ticking over but much needs to be done to them.  However, child mental health services have not been addressed whatsoever.  They are the worst of the worst.  Chapter ten of A Vision for Change talks about children.  The Ombudsman for Children said we need A Vision for Change dedicated to children.  Hopefully, the future of mental health care committee, ably chaired by Senator Freeman, will make recommendations in its report.<\/p> <p>Last week the committee heard from the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  It described to a gob-smacked room how nurses can only offer a plastic chair as a bed to children in adult psychiatric units.  That is obviously the impact of the closure of the Linn Dara child and adolescent mental health service.  This is repeated across the country.  It is detrimental to a young person, never mind a young person in distress.<\/p> <p>Our duty of care is to the children.  From the start, it is compromised and health care workers acknowledge their failure to deliver therapeutic care or an appropriate environment for such care.  It is unacceptable we are allowing children to suffer in unsuitable environments.  Adult psychiatric environments can no longer accommodate children.  It is terrifying for them.  It traumatises and isolates them and is wholly inappropriate.  To echo Senator Freeman's words, it is above all sorrowful.<\/p> <p>I support these amendments, as should all Members.

I was just visiting them or dropping somebody in and I found them quite challenging places to be in.  I was in the full of my health.  What must it be like for a child who is already suffering to arrive in a place like that?  It is just wrong in every sense of the word.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, will agree with that and that he will take what is being said here on board.<\/p><p>It is not an unreasonable request that we would explore all possible avenues and look at all possible ways of treating children without having to bring them into such an environment.  Again, I do not think anybody in this room would disagree that we should find suitable accommodation for children who are already in a state of crisis.

Without delaying the Minister of State further, I fully support Senator Freeman.  I will also support the amendment.  It is important that this is not just a talking shop but it leads to actions on the other side.  I know the Minister of State will want to do that.  I also know there are massive constraints on the public purse at the moment but when we are talking about children, the constraints on the public purse should not come into the equation at all.

I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come before the House.  I have always found him willing to listen.

I will discuss the amendment relating to training and I also wish to speak in general terms in support of the Bill.<\/p><p>In Ireland today, a significant number of children and young people are living in pain and distress, reflected in poor mental health, sometimes ending tragically in suicide.  We all know a child and young person that meets that description.  We have all been at one of those awful funerals.  Those that love them - their parents, brothers and sisters and their families - share in that pain and distress.  They are desperate for help for their son or daughter, brother or sister and for themselves.<\/p><p>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee, ably chaired by Senator Freeman, reported in October 2017 on children's mental health services.  The report states that of the approximate 1.15 million people under the age of 18, estimates show that 115,000 have mental health illnesses, and that 23,000 children have very serious and disabling mental health problems.  That is a sizeable grouping of people that we are talking about here tonight.<\/p><p>The causes of the pain and distress among children and young people are many and varied.  Each person has his or her own unique story.  Some reasons date back to infancy and poor attachments to loved ones.  Others stem from growing up in insecure and anxious circumstances.  Poverty is not good for children and young people's mental health and well-being, it never is, nor is growing up around parental addictions.  We can imagine that the mental health and well-being of our children is not well served by living in emergency hostels, hotels or hubs, living in consistent poverty and all that goes with the transience borne of a broken housing system.  A June 2017 study, Homelessness and Mental Health, found that those suffering from housing-related burdens are far more susceptible to mental ill health than the wider society, and that has its own effects on children and young people.<\/p><p>We know some groups of children are particularly vulnerable to mental ill health, for example, children and young people with disabilities, who often fall through the cracks of a system that does not work for them.  Another such group is children and young people with autism.  We heard today of people being afraid of an autism diagnosis because they are directed to the CAMHS system which is not able to provide the necessary level of support.  In addition, children and young people who are LGBTI are vulnerable because issues of deep-rooted discrimination can undermine their mental health.  Another such group is children and young people from the Traveller community, in which suicide and the impact caused by bereavement over suicide is startling.  The suicide rate within the Traveller community is six times higher than that of wider society.  That heart-breaking trend sadly affects all ages, and the impact of those losses on children's mental health is shocking.  As one woman from the community recently put it, &quot;We've a pain on our shoulders from carrying coffins.&quot;<\/p><p>In Ireland today we fail, time and again, some of the most vulnerable and precious children and young people.  They are children whom we should be wrapping in cotton wool.  They are children and young people who need our love and care the most and who with the right early supports for themselves and their families could be spared a life of medication, and intermittent and often inappropriate incarceration in settings not suitable for them.  It is a case of lives being interrupted and wasted.<\/p><p>Since 2006, Ireland has witnessed a shrinking in care, in State-led support, and an ever-increasing trend of neglect towards children and young people with mental health issues.  Statistics on the state of mental health of young people in Ireland are disturbing.  In 2017, UNICEF's report entitled, Building the Future: Children and the Sustainable Development Goals in Rich Countries,<i><\/i>showed that Ireland is lagging behind its European counterparts.  The report outlines a decades-old decline in mental health care, riddled with reductions in Government spending allocated for mental health services.  Numbers do not lie.  The percentage of the total health budget allocated for mental health stood at 13% in 1984, dropping to 7.3% in 2004.  Today, in 2018, this percentage stands at 6.1% of the overall health budget.  In 2006, the HSE's A Vision for Change recommended that 100 inpatient beds would be made available for a child population that was 21% lower than it is now.  Despite the recommendation, and a clear increasing demand, inpatient beds in July 2017 stood at 48 beds.  Year after year, figures continue to show a complete lack of respect or even denial of the gravity of the problems in child mental health in Ireland.<\/p><p>In October 2017, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, of which I am a member, released a report on the state of children's mental health services in Ireland.  While the report and the voices it drew upon highlighted the courage and bravery of hundreds, perhaps thousands of parents of mentally-ill children, and the sheer commitment of doctors, hospital personnel, and all those within our broken mental health services system, it remains just that, a broken system.  It is a system that is quite frankly unfit to care for children and young people in Ireland.<\/p><p>I and others received an open letter some weeks ago from broken hearted and broken spirited parents.  I spoke to the father on Monday and I understand they wish to meet the Minister of State.  The letter outlined how the broken mental health system is failing a beloved 17-year old young woman and her family.  The letter outlines their daughter's first experience of the system when their happy, healthy then 14 year old daughter suddenly, without warning became severely mentally ill.  She had to go through the gamut of accident and emergency, which not an easy place for a distressed child.  She was then admitted to a public ward, albeit a children's ward.  The letter sets out the impact of the young woman's illness on her young brother and sister who have also been &quot;traumatised&quot; by the situation.  The letter underlines how having access to a dedicated child mental health setting, as Senator Freeman has proposed, and providing a range of supports including family therapy enabled their daughter to recover.<\/p><p>We know that mental health can be fragile and so the young woman became ill again in early 2017 but she was no longer a patient of the dedicated setting.  Only after pressure from her parents did she get access to the dedicated unit and recovered again.  Some of the doctors were insisting that she be admitted to the children's public ward which did not work for the child during her first breakdown.  In the letter her family wrote that before Christmas the young woman became ill again.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The young woman is now under the care of the HSE child and adolescent mental health services.  Senators will soon see how little this means.  Her parents contacted CAMHS and went to the CAMHS clinic.  They said that to enter the CAMHS clinic they had first to walk through a chemist and a series of waiting rooms for the dentist and general practitioner services.  They said this exposed their distressed daughter to the eyes of the public.  They were told by a secretary that the staff did not see distressed children in CAMHS.  I had thought that was what CAMHS was all about.  Then they were told to wait in a public area with their daughter who was agitated, delusional and frightened.  The family were then told there were no more private rooms in which to wait.  They were told that no consultant was available to see their daughter.  Then their daughter was suddenly seen by a consultant after all.  They requested access to the dedicated unit but were told that the setting was full and that it was best to apply for beds hundreds of miles away.  There were no beds there either.  Eventually, they were informed that no bed was available for their daughter in any children's mental health unit in the entire country.  Eventually, the distressed young woman was offered an adult bed with a promise that a bed in a dedicated unit might become available if funding was secured.  The suggestion was to transfer the young woman from the CAMHS clinic to the hospital by ambulance.  The family objected, taking the view that it would only add to her trauma.  They preferred to drive her there themselves.  The only way they could leave CAMHS privately was through a fire exit down a dark stairway.  At the exit, the alarm was triggered as they walked into the darkness of the car park of an Aldi supermarket.<\/p><p>In the letter, the parents remarked that the most compassion they and their daughter received was from a cleaning lady in CAMHS and a security guard in the hospital.  There is something altogether wrong with this situation.  It is astonishing that this happened to such a vulnerable young woman and her family in Ireland only some weeks ago.  This situation is not isolated.  Senator Freeman referred to a case involving a young woman and the decision by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.<\/p><p>These cases should not arise for our children, our young people and their desperate families in 2018.  It does not have to be like this.  We need an adequate budget for mental health and child mental health.  We must move back to the 13% allocation we had in 1984.  We need a CAMHS service that, instead of gatekeeping, is loving.  We need a service that cares for our children.  The service should welcome them in rather than running away from them and their families.<\/p><p>In these CAMHS services and in primary care we need easily accessible family therapy to be a standard feature of the range of supports in every community in Ireland.  It should be as available as dentistry.  Family therapy has been researched and shown to have proven benefits on the state of mental health, especially for young people.  Family therapy has benefits for a wide range of reasons.  It exposes young people to a more open comfortable environment while respecting their dignity and treating mental illnesses without overbearing reliance on mediation.  It has a proven track record in reducing the necessity for psychiatric hospitalisation.<\/p><p>In the case of the deeply troubling experiences of the first young woman I talked about, alternative treatment proved highly beneficial and helped her family as well.  We need a range of services and supports, including inpatient beds and child-appropriate settings.  We need an end to children and young people being cared for and treated in adult settings.  They are inappropriate and the staff there may not have the training they need.  It is important that children and young people are reviewed regularly, since a person's condition can change positively or negatively and the care and support may need to change accordingly.<\/p><p>I congratulate Senator Freeman and I support the Bill, as amended, including the amendment I have proposed on training.  The best proven means of treatment of young people involves treating them as young people in environments where they are most comfortable.  They should be treated by people they know and trust and those who have specific expertise and understanding in supporting them.  The deteriorating state of our children's mental health service urgently requires some forward, progressive thinking.  We are doing our best in the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.  Family therapy needs to be made commonly available and, as I said, it should be as common as dentistry.  We need new thinking on this serious issue.<\/p><p>I appeal to the Minister of State to support the Bill, to accept the amendments and to consider the benefits of family therapy.  I call on the Minister of State to outline his plans for family therapy in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#TT00300","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I said before that I agree with the broad thrust of the Bill.  I imagine no one in the House would disagree.  It is aimed to protect vulnerable young people.<\/p> <p>Senator Freeman's amendment is most welcome, as is Senator Kelleher's amendment relating to any child admitted to an adult inpatient unit.  It provides that such a child would be treated by staff who have appropriate training in treating children and young people.<\/p> <p>Like Senator Craughwell, my only engagement in some of these centres was when I had to bring in friends of mine.  I am familiar with two adult facilities.  It was an uncomfortable experience.  I would hate if I was a young person going into these facilities.  The Bill is most welcome in that regard.  All the people I assisted are all living around in the community.  No one knows of the trauma they went through.  It is wonderful to think that such help and assistance is available today, although it was not available 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  That comes from someone who is not as up to date with the various issues.<\/p> <p>I was in the Seanad for the debate on A Vision for Change.  It was heralded as a major change at the time.  Senator Devine said there is much good in A Vision for Change.  However, a great deal was not included.  At the time I remember we thought it would be the panacea for all ills.  The only problem was whether the money would be ring-fenced.  I was very disappointed that some of the recommendations were not carried through.  That is why we are here today.  The amendment derives from a group made up of a cross-section of mental health professionals and stakeholders, including the Mental Health Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Irish Mental Health Lawyers Association and service user representatives.<\/p> <p>The report of the expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 contained 165 recommendations specifically relating to children.  The expert group made 13 recommendations on how our mental health legislation could be improved.<\/p> <p>Senator Kelleher referenced the fact that in 2008 some 247 child admissions to adult units were recorded, but the figure decreased to 68 in 2016.  However, we all agree that one child admission to an adult unit is one too many.  Senator Freeman pointed out several times that there is protective legislation in England and Wales that provides for a child who is admitted or detained in a hospital for treatment.  The environment of the hospital must be suitable having regard to age.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  We are following another jurisdiction that has probably spent more time and resources.  Maybe we have at times overlooked the fact that mental health for children is as important as mental health for adults.  What we are trying to do is facilitate children in a different area.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is able to take on board some of the expert recommendations.  This is what legislation is all about.  We all have a perceived view.  Sometimes we talk to our solicitors or people.  The Minister of State has taken time to look at all options.  Sometimes with legislation one never gets what one wants 100%.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has taken expert advice and is not simply pushing this through.  The point is that it is in the best interests to have the best legislation.  I appreciate that.  We have no issue with this and we are very supportive of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#UU00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  The arguments outlined by the Senator are well made.  This is the place to put in the provisions and the detail of the legislation.  Too often we have been replying and relying on guidelines and protocol, most of which are never observed or implemented.  The Minister of State needs to look at that.  This is not about a token Bill.  This is about ensuring that legislation will have an effect on the practices employed.  As we have seen tragically time and again our systems are not up to standard.  There are no consequences for people who do not follow protocols or guidelines and, as a result, people suffer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is the result we have seen time and again.  Legislation is required to ensure these things will no longer happen and that the Government will stop hiding behind tokenistic Bills and press statements and spend the money when it is available.  The detail provided by experts who are aware of what is happening in the field must be taken into account and included in legislation to stop what is occurring from happening.  All too often, the Government has been rightly condemned by the courts for not having put facilities in place.  However, the courts can take no action because there are no legal grounds for doing so.  If the Bill were implemented, the Government would be required to act and ensure facilities were put in place and, if not, ensure mechanisms were put in place for a review in order that we would no longer have to hear about horrific cases.  We have heard about but one of many such cases that happen every day.  I refer to parents who are lost because the system has failed them.  It fails them because there is no legislation in place to dictate to the Government and those who are supposed to be providing the services what they should do.  As we have seen time and again, including at the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and Portlaoise hospital, if we were to put more money into the system in order that we would not have to spend it on reports to discover what happened when the system failed, we would have better outcomes.  However, legislation is required.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to accept the amendments to ensure people would not have to go through car parks and be treated with humanity by the security guard but not by the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#UU00300","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  When I was downstairs listening to Senators Joan Freeman and Colette Kelleher talking about the amendments, I was reminded that both were the nominees of the former Taoiseach.  Fine Gael's former leader chose these distinguished persons as nominees to the Seanad.  That is important and I know why he chose them.  It was because they were advocates in their own right and would bring enormous value to this House.  It is important to acknowledge that and I want the Minister of State to take it on board as I set out some comments on what the Senators said.<\/p> <p>I suppose we are all advocates.  A journalist asked me some days ago what I liked most about my work in the Seanad.  I said the first and most important thing was not necessarily scrutinising legislation, although that is important, with work at Oireachtas joint committees, but being an advocate for people outside the House, whatever their experience, their sad or good past, or their future.  That is the most challenging aspect, but it is also the most rewarding.  We bring to the job our personal experience.  I have said before that we see the world from where we stand and our experiences within it.  We are touched by sadness, personal stories and personal grief, but we bring them because that is what it is about.  It is about humanity and empathy.  It is also about standing shoulder to shoulder with those who need our support.  Therefore, I can see why Senator Joan Freeman was picked.  It was because of her sterling work in championing the cause of promoting good mental health.  We all knew about her work long before she came into the House and she is passionate about it.  She has organised a number of the consultation committee meetings.  She has brought in people from the health sector, service users and people who were meant to be providing services.  There were stark differences in their experiences.<\/p> <p>I spoke to a number of families who told me harrowing stories about accessing or trying to gain access to services.  They did not want to have to access services, but they had come to a point where they could not cope.  In one case, it was a difficult son who needed help.  It took his family a long time to come to terms with the difficulty.  We all have high expectations for our children, but there comes a time when we need a little extra support.  The woman in question told me about her terrible experiences and the trauma inflicted on her and her family.  It was particularly difficult for her and her husband when they had to say goodbye to a child for a period.  She referred to the types of service her family were being offered and how they had been treated.  We have to do something about it.<\/p> <p>I have no doubt about the Minister of State's commitment to mental health and health services generally.  However, the days of nodding and saying we will do something in the future are over.  That is no longer acceptable.  The days of saying we are abstaining are also over.  That, too, is no longer acceptable.  We are in a public chamber and have an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment, which is important.<\/p> <p>I want to share another story.  I spoke to a woman in her 60s who had been in care and who had two children with mental health issues.  She was on her own and vulnerable.  She had two daughters and outlined her experiences.  The trauma revisited on that woman who had lived in care until she was 16 years old and who was then thrown out on the street by a State care system was really heartbreaking.  She had to relive a terrible experience and had difficulty in fighting the establishment.<\/p> <p>I spoke only some weeks ago to a man whose daughter had been involved in a very difficult crime owing to her mental health issues.  The case has been processed and help has now been offered.  Again, the man's experience was frightening.  He was left without support.  When he saw what was being offered to him and his children by way of care, he noted that it was very different from what he believed CAMHS would be about.  We have to do something about it.<\/p> <p>We are empowered, as politicians in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and have an opportunity to address this issue.  I urge Senator Joan Freeman to pursue the amendment.  I urge everyone present in the House and every Member outside the Chamber to take a stand together, send a strong message, support the amendments and the Bill and the Minister of State in making progress on what is critical legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#VV00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Joan Freeman and acknowledge her contribution, not only on this legislation but to the cause in general.  I welcome every opportunity we get to highlight the issues and challenges faced in the mental health system.  I do not mind hearing about the bad stories and more of them because they all give me an insight.  It is important that we all maintain a balance when speaking about mental health.  There are many very vulnerable persons to whom we are trying to reach out and whom we are trying to encourage to seek help and come into the system.  We do not want to send the message that the system is a basket case or that it is not fit for purpose.  Therefore, we have a responsibility at all times to watch the language we use.  We also have a responsibility to the staff who amount to almost 10,000, the vast majority of whom are superb, committed, dedicated and really generous.  They give great service.  We should keep this in mind when making overall statements on the health service.<\/p> <p>I wish to address the specific issue raised in the Bill for which I commend Senator Joan Freeman.  I have had considerable engagement with her on it and on every occasion found her extremely passionate and willing.  I admit that she was not always easy to work with because of her passion and conviction, but she always worked with the best interests of the service user at heart.  She has been challenging and certainly challenged me as Minister of State and also my officials from time to time.  However, that is most welcome as that is her role.  The day the previous Taoiseach appointed her was a good one for mental health services and this House as everybody in it recognises.  I support the comments made in that regard.<\/p> <p>I wish to address the specifics of the Bill and outline the issues and challenges we face.  Legislation is a great tool and can be very effective, but it can also be very challenging for practitioners.  From the outset the Senator acknowledged the difficulty with a black and white Bill when it was pointed out to her.  Eighteen years is the arbitrary age we have chosen at which a young person becomes an adult.  Although it is not proposed, if we were to implement legislation today stipulating that nobody under the age of 18 years could be placed in an adult unit, it could have unintended consequences.  That is what the practitioners have told us.  There are 17 year olds who might be more suited, physically and otherwise, to an adult facility.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They may be very big or very strong.  Even though they are 17, they may be more suited to being in an adult unit.  There may also be people who are 18 but who have issues of delayed development which have left them very childlike.  It may be more appropriate for such a person to be in a children's unit.  There are also issues with availability at any given time.  There may be a place in an adult unit but none in a children's unit.  Family preferences also play a role.  This is what clinicians say.  This is not the Government or anybody else speaking, it is the people who practise in this area.  They will say that a crude instrument which puts everybody over 18 into an adult unit and everybody under 18 into a child centre will not always result in the best available outcome.  It could result in a situation whereby a 17 year old is denied a service because there is no place for him or her in a child unit on a given night and he or she is not allowed into the adult unit because of legislation.  Perhaps it is the lesser of two evils to place such a person in an adult unit.  There are very strict protocols.  When a child is put into an adult unit, the Mental Health Commission has to be notified straight away and there is a certain list of protocols to be adhered to.  That is just by way of background and to let Senators know that it is not black and white or straightforward, as I am sure they understand.  That is what it makes this issue difficult and challenging for all of us to deal with.<\/p><p>To deal with specifics, I also acknowledge Senator Kelleher's contribution and her two amendments.  The Senator is aware of the issue with her two amendments which propose to amend section 2.  If we accept the amendments which Senator Freeman has tabled, then section 2 will be amended.  It will then be very difficult to accept the other amendments because they should be made to the Bill, as amended.  Although it is a decision for herself, I ask Senator Kelleher to consider resubmitting the amendments on Report Stage.  It is a technicality, that is all.  It is not that I do not believe that staff should be appropriately trained.  That is not what I am saying.  It is just that the Senator has proposed to amend section 2, but we are about to change that section so those amendments cannot technically be facilitated.  I hope that she will resubmit them on Report Stage.  I can work with her in the meantime and we can facilitate the amendments.  It is a technicality, but this is a decision for the Senator herself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#VV00300","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I am happy to go with that proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#WW00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":555,"content":"<p>The Senator is happy to withdraw amendments Nos. 2 and 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#WW00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Yes, but I will resubmit them on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#WW00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I will work with the Senator in the interim to facilitate the amendments.  I want to be clear that the Government welcomes amendments Nos. 1 and 4 which have been tabled by Senator Freeman.  These replace the original section 2 of her Bill with revised provisions.  While we have concerns about the text, we support the aims of these provisions.  As I have already said, Senator Kelleher's amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are very well intentioned and we seek to support them as well, but they seek to amend and add to the original section 2.  If we accept Senator Freeman's amendments, Senator Kelleher's amendments cannot be accepted as they seek to amend a section which will now read very differently.<\/p> <p>While welcoming the progress made on the Bill as it moves through Committee Stage, I need to inform the House about the difficulties I face with the text and timing of the Bill as Minister of State, which I had ideally intended to address on Report Stage in the Seanad.  First, the text of amendment No. 1, which seeks to amend section 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001, and the text of amendment No. 4, which seeks to amend the Long Title of Senator Freeman's Bill, include reference to admission orders.  If the Senator intends for both voluntary and involuntary admissions to be covered by the Bill, then the term \"admission orders\" should not be used as such orders are for involuntary patients only, as set out in section 25 of the 2001 Act.  The use of this term alone would result in children who are admitted to an approved centre on a voluntary basis not being subject to the provisions listed in the Senator's amendment.  If the Senator's intention is that the proposed provisions should apply to the voluntary admission of children, the text of the provisions would need to be revised to include a specific reference to those who are admitted on a voluntary basis.  On the other hand, if the Senator does in fact intend for the amendment to apply only to those who are involuntarily admitted, then the term \"admission orders\" may still be used, but these new provisions should most likely be in section 25 of the Mental Health Act 2001 rather than section 4 as amendment No. 1 currently proposes.<\/p> <p>In addition, the Senator refers to consultant psychiatrists making the admission orders.  An admission order to admit a child involuntarily is made by the courts, not a consultant.  Furthermore, it is the HSE that makes an application to the court, not a consultant.  Amendment No. 1 also refers to a \"child inpatient unit\".  This term is not used in the Mental Health Act 2001 and, therefore, if it is to be introduced in this Bill, the most likely definition of the term would have to be added taking account of due consideration of any such proposals.<\/p> <p>Finally, in the list of proposed provisions, the Senator mentions at the proposed section 4(4)(b) that a child's environment should be \"suitable having regard to their age and needs\", while at the proposed section 4(4)(d) there is mention of the need for \"age-appropriate facilities\".  The distinction between these two subsections is not clear.  More clarity on the exact nature of the difference will be needed.<\/p> <p>Text changes aside, the other difficulty which constrains me from putting forward considered amendments at this stage is simply the issue of timing.  In this regard, Members will be aware that another Bill, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017, introduced by Deputy James Browne, is due to go to Committee Stage in the Seanad next week on 14 February.  That Bill proposes to amend the same section of the Mental Health Act 2001 as Senator Freeman's Bill.  Deputy Browne's Bill has already passed through all Stages in the D&aacute;il.  My difficulty is that both Bills have or are likely to have provisions relating to child admissions to approved centres.  Dealing with two amendment Bills simultaneously is certainly a challenge for me as Minister of State and for my officials.  For the purposes of clarity and to avoid confusion, it would be better if the text of one Bill were to be finalised before dealing with the detail of the other.<\/p> <p>For example, Deputy Browne's Bill seeks to delete the reference to best interests in section 4 of the Mental Act 2001 and replace it with guiding principles, one of which will likely refer to age-appropriate facilities for child admissions.  Deputy Browne's proposals are broadly in line with a recommendation of the expert group review of the Act which was published in 2015.  As I mentioned earlier, Senator Freeman's Bill also refers to age-appropriate facilities which could now be changed to guiding principles.  Senator Freeman's amendment would also add a new subsection to section 4 of the 2001 Act, but Deputy Browne's Bill will delete the current section 4 of the Act and replace it with entirely new provisions.  Where there is such an overlap, there is clear potential for confusion.  My priority has to be that any new legislation is appropriate, clear and correctly drafted.<\/p> <p>I can confirm that the Government accepts amendments Nos. 1 and 4 in the name of Senator Freeman but, for the reasons I have outlined which I believe Senator Kelleher accepts, the Government cannot accept amendments Nos. 2 and 3 at this stage.  I will have Government amendments to propose on Report Stage when I hope there will be greater clarity on the agreed final text of Deputy Browne's Bill.  I appreciate that this is confusing and difficult, but these issues are technicalities.  We all support the spirit of the Bill.  That is what everybody has spoken about.  There are, however, technicalities which I have a responsibility to consider when amending primary legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#WW00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I also want to refer to something that Senator Kelleher said when she spoke about child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  I agree with the Minister of State.  The people who provide the services are the hardest working men and women imaginable.  They are in the most difficult situations.  They are as frustrated as the rest of us watching the children in the care.  In fact, we got a very emotional email from a psychiatric nurse in the Waterford hospital last night.  She finds this practice so distressing.  This is why there is such a rate of burnout among our clinical staff.  When we talk about CAMHS, we are talking about the people who make decisions for CAMHS at an administrative level and at policy level.  They are the people I would criticise, not the people who work in the area.<\/p> <p>One of the words Senator Feighan used was \"uncomfortable\".  That reflects everybody in this country.  Nobody likes to think about mental health.  Sadly, previous governments have banked on that uncomfortableness, although I hope this Government will not, in order that nobody would look at what is really happening deep down in our society.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joan Freeman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2483\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2483&amp;amp;pid=JoanFreeman&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Mark Daly spoke about accountability.  We already have protocols and procedures in the different clinical areas in hospitals and in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, units, but who is ensuring that they are carried out?  This amendment will ensure that there is accountability.<\/p><p>In regard to Deputy James Browne's Bill, there are a couple of issues about which the Minister of State is absolutely incorrect.  We do not overlap.  I was also promised that this amendment would be a stand-alone measure, simply because we have to do something for these children right now.<\/p><p>I must make a couple of remarks on the wording which was mentioned.  I have used the words \"admission order\".  I was wrong to do that.  What was intended was \"admission\".  That means that children who are admitted to adult psychiatric units, not through an order but in general.  Every child needs to have that safety, security and protocols in place.<\/p><p>Another point raised was that a child inpatient unit has not been defined in the Bill.  I think we all know what that means, but I will amend this.  In regard to the overlap between subsections (4)(b) and (4)(d), I note that the former requires that \"the child&rsquo;s environment is suitable having regard to their age and needs\", while the latter also mentions age.  We need to separate those, so that subsection (4)(b) refers to age and (4)(d) to gender.  I absolutely concede that.<\/p><p>Returning to the issue of Deputy Browne's Bill, it is unfair not to let either one pass.  I know that Deputy Browne's Bill has gone through the D&aacute;il, and it is almost on Report Stage.  We must not let that stop us from ensuring that there is a protocol for the HSE to follow when a child is admitted into an adult psychiatric unit.  Deputy Browne's Bill does not cover that.  He also talks about children being admitted through a court order.  In carrying out my research over the last few weeks, I have been in contact with various CAMHS units.  It is very rare for a child to be admitted into an adult psychiatric unit through a court order.  We are talking about children who are admitted into adult psychiatric units in general.<\/p><p>I reiterate that what this Bill does is reflect the recommendations of the Mental Health Commission, which is connected to the HSE.  We are not doing anything different or difficult.  These measures have already been recommended.  When the Minister of State is looking at Deputy Browne's Bill next week, I ask him not to let it cloud what this Bill is all about.  I look forward to discussing this Bill with the Minister of State, and making those very slight changes to it, the following week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020700002#WW01000","speaker":"1428","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517999400,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his explanation.

People should not be looking after young children in distress without appropriate levels of training, irrespective of whether or not it is in a unit specifically for children.
