He is joined by Mr. Mark Brady, the deputy director of audit.<\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.<\/p> <p>  I propose we postpone dealing with the business of the committee and meet directly with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As people are aware, he will be here until lunchtime after which he will go before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  We will probably have a session very early in the afternoon to deal with the routine business of the committee's correspondence and to complete the periodic report that has been discussed several times in private session.  That will also be in private session.  We will also discuss the annual report that will be launched next week.  The annual report is a statistical compilation of all of the meetings and witnesses but does not have conclusions or recommendations.  It is just a summary of the work.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin I want to deal with an issue.  We issued an invitation to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure at Reform, Robert Watt, and in the letter of invitation we specifically asked for Mr. Paul Quinn to come along and for officials from the Department of Health with responsibility for the health Vote to come along.  The position, and I am conscious of it, is the first reason we asked Paul Quinn to come along was we received a letter from him some time ago in his role in the Office of Government Procurement.  He is also a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  Our interest in Mr. Quinn relates to his role specifically on that board.  Members of the board and representatives from the Department of Health have come before the committee but Mr. Quinn was not at the previous meeting.  We have requested him to come before the committee.  The appropriate time for Paul Quinn to come before the committee is when the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board comes back before the committee because what we want to talk to him about is his role as a director of that board.  I do not have the names today but I am inclined to suggest any other public servant on that board should also be here that day.  A key element of our work is the interaction between public servants and the State bodies and boards they serve on and the lines of communications with the relevant Minister.<\/p> <p>  The main issue for today's meeting is capital projects and not the children's hospital.  We have dealt with the children's hospital previously and we have agreed to come back to it again as soon as the report on the cost overruns is ready, when the national paediatric hospital development board will come before the committee again.  That is the meeting we will need Mr. Quinn to attend in his capacity as a director of the board and I expect he will be here on that day.<\/p> <p>  I will now throw it open to comment.  It is a valid point.  We read Mr. Quinn's detailed letter at a previous meeting.  Some people may have read it and others may not.  His line Minister in respect of his role on the board is the Minister for Health who appointed him to the board.  It is a health function.  Members may comment.  I am laying out the context.  As he pointed out in his letter, he has he has no role with regard to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of his membership of the board of directors, as I understand it.  People might disagree with this.  His reporting structure is to the Department of Health and the Minister for Health.  We said this at the previous meeting.  Several members have indicated and we will proceed with the meeting.  I am most dissatisfied that this invitation was issued a month ago but we learned only late last night that Mr. Quinn was not coming here today.  That is a source of annoyance and aggravation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#B00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Was that communication from Mr. Quinn himself?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#B00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>No, it was from the Secretary General of the Department.

I have no difficulty if he wants to come in on two occasions, if the Department and the board come before the committee again.  If Mr. Quinn wants to come before the committee again as a board member that is fine but we were looking for him as the head of the Office of Government Procurement and somebody who also sat on the board.  He is in a unique position.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman said we learned of this only last night.  As members of the committee we have to prepare for meetings.  A lot of the preparation was about the minutes relating to Mr. Quinn's involvement as a board member.  Some of them relate to the joint committees on construction and finance, where he is cited, including on 30 August 2018.  We cannot put any of the questions we prepared for him because he is not here and we learned of it at the very last minute.<\/p> <p>  We have an opening statement from Mr. Watt that runs to 18 pages and he does not mention the national children's hospital once.  I accept it is not the basis on which he is coming before the committee, which is a much broader remit, but, at the same time, in the documentation he sent us on the major projects in Project Ireland 2040 the national children's hospital is the second major project listed.  It is one of the major projects but Mr. Watt does not reference it once in his statement.  This is a clear tactic by the Accounting Officer.  I am putting it on the record that from my perspective there is an attempt by some at the top of the public service to kick back against the Committee of Public Accounts and we are seeing it more and more.  Here is another example of it.  We have to stand our ground as a committee.  We do our best.  We ask questions without fear or favour.  There are a lot of issues and questions surrounding the spend on the national children's hospital and a number of Departments are involved in its oversight, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of these issues and we have reasonable questions we want to put.  I do not want this to be a game that is being played by senior civil servants.  The Accounting Officer is due to appear before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach today.  There was an attempt to play one committee off against the other through the media a number of weeks ago.  That is not good enough.  It is not a good way for an Accounting Officer to treat committees of the Oireachtas.  That is my opinion, and mine only.  I say that in the context of putting all of this on the record.<\/p><p> I will conclude, particularly as other members wish to comment.  I am deeply disappointed that Mr. Quinn is not here.  Up to last night, we were under the impression that he would be.  We prepared for it and he should be here because he was invited to appear.  It is not for Mr. Watt alone to decide who comes before us.  He can bring whomever he wants from his Department but, from my perspective, if we make a specific request for someone to be here, then we should be able to expect that he or she will appear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#B01000","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I agree 100% with Deputy Cullinane.

We had correspondence from Mr. Watt, or certainly from his Department, previously stating that the Accounting Officer would decide what team he or she would bring.

We got a hint in previous correspondence that, in effect, this person would not be made available; it said that the Accounting Officer would decide.  That is fine.  He is within the rules.  Can the Chairman, the clerk or whomever advise on who we should petition to change the rules?  If we are examining public expenditure and there are people who are heads of particular functions such as public procurement and the Committee of Public Accounts, because of some euphemistic interpretation of the practice or the rules, is precluded, in a vexatious fashion, from talking to those people, that is wrong.  I totally disagree with the Chairman's assessment to the effect that, because this person served on the board, it was a matter for the Department of Health and that we would be looking at that again.  I am sorry.  It is coincidental that the man happened to be on the board.  The reality is that his function is public procurement and when we are looking at matters like tendering and so on, what that individual has to say adds value.  If he does not have anything of value to add - I am sure Mr. Watt will be perfectly fluent in answering all those questions to do with tendering later - perhaps there is some other person who could be brought in.  I do not care but I see this as proff of officialdom's continued annoyance with the Committee of Public Accounts in the context of its role in asking questions.  If we are to put up with this kind of thing, we might as well declare an actual dictatorship - instead of the virtual one in which we are currently living - and abolish committees because the tail is wagging the dog.<\/p> <p>  I have read this opening statement and, frankly, the most political of political speeches by any Minister in the past, from whatever party, would barely be as good at blowing one's own trumpet in the context of policy.  We are not interested necessarily in policy today, as Mr. Watt well knows.  We are interested in the intricacies of why &euro;1 billion of the public's money, which this time last year was not going to be needed, is now needed and all we have is an 18-page document from the chief officer responsible to this committee in which he manages not to mention the national children's hospital once.  That is tantamount to giving a Harvey Smith to the committee.  It is giving us the two fingers and stating, \"We will do what we want, when we want\".  The document also lists a series of suggested improvements that will be made at some stage in the future but, as always, there is no accountability to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#C02200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I was the one who asked for him to come in given that he is the head of the Office of Government Procurement.  We had a discussion about this last week and, essentially, this is entirely within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts because it is about process and failures of process.  We need to understand those failures.  It appears that there is an institutional gap and yet we cannot explore that with this official in the context of his exact remit.  For example, would he be looking at industry norms relating to bids for a contract in terms of whether it is good tendering practice and what advice he might be able to give us.  There is no point in having the head of Government procurement, who effectively can control the purchase of biros, give advice and ensure that proper procurement happens if we do not have people controlling the big projects about which the public will be concerned relating to the way tendering happens and how a particular type of arrangement happens.  I refer, for example, to a special committee and the control there is of that.  It would be enormously helpful to us given that he has the dual roles of being head of the Office of Government Procurement and also having been on the board of the national children's hospital.  He is in a unique position to give us that insight.  We said that this morning would be about capital projects and control of capital projects.  One would have to ask whether he has a role in this at all.  I would have liked to ask him about his role.

One of these is the national children's hospital.  I want to put the &euro;140 billion of expenditure under this plan in context.  The children's hospital represents about 2% of that amount.  The committee is concerned that the issues affecting that project will arise in other major projects.  We wish to know what control mechanisms are in place to deal with that.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>Members of the committee are also reminded of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a member of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.

This has an important role to play in alleviating capacity constraints that might otherwise restrict economic and social progress.  Value for money is the key policy objective and policy seeks to support efficient and sustainable public investment.<\/p> <p>  The selection, appraisal, and delivery of individual public capital projects is the responsibility of each relevant Department.  My Department is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the national development plan within Project Ireland 2040, supporting value for money and protecting sustainable capital investment of the State.  In that context, I will discuss very briefly Project Ireland 2040 and progress in rolling out the different projects; the existing processes for selection, appraisal and delivery of public sector capital projects, including governance; and the plans in place to strengthen those processes.<\/p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040 was launched a year ago.  As Deputies are aware, it seeks to achieve ten strategic outcomes building around the overarching themes of well-being, equality and opportunity.  It consists of the national development plan and the national planning framework and it seeks the alignment of investment with the spatial outcomes set out in the planning framework.  Project Ireland 2040 moves beyond the approach of the past, which saw public investment spread too thinly and investment decisions that did not align with a spatial strategy.  These practices contributed to some of the major issues that we face today as a country, particularly the predominance of Dublin in terms of economic growth and development, alongside the challenges facing rural communities.<\/p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040 seeks to develop Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford as viable cities of scale that can act as alternatives and a counterbalance to the continued growth of Dublin and its surrounding region.  These cities will act as drivers of growth for their wider regions and for rural areas.  Over the first ten years of Project Ireland 2040, &euro;116 billion will be invested and investment will reach 3.5% of national income - defined through GNI* rather than GDP - this year and over 4% of national income by 2027.  This significant acceleration in investment is in line with national and international analysis to the effect that Ireland's public capital infrastructure needs to be substantially strengthened to support the resilience of our economy in response to risks such as Brexit.  As Deputies are aware, public capital spending was necessarily impacted upon as the Government sought to restore the public finances during the recession.  This plan seeks to accelerate the necessary catch-up in public capital infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  There has been much recent commentary on the delivery of large-scale projects.  In that commentary, we can lose sight of the significant progress that is being made.  Project Ireland 2040 is already delivering better transport links, facilitating improved health and environmental outcomes and delivering more housing.  I will not go through the list of projects but I will highlight some of them.  The national road network is being upgraded and, for example, the M11 Gorey-Enniscorthy motorway will open to traffic later this year.  It is the largest project under way in the State and is currently scheduled to be completed on time and on budget.  Works will be started on key arteries on the N4, as Deputies know, the Ardee bypass, the N22 and many other projects.<\/p> <p>  To improve our international connectivity, works commenced on the new runway at Dublin Airport last month, which is due to be operational by 2021.  This is a significant project for Dublin Airport, and we can consider the time taken to deliver it compared with high-profile runways in our nearest neighbour.  It is a useful benchmark of the speed with which this project will be delivered.<\/p> <p>  There will be over 90 new school building projects in construction this year and over 300 schools will benefit from minor works improvements, while 2019 will see the completion of the national forensic mental hospital and the opening of 18 primary care centres throughout the country.  There will be 6,500 social housing units developed and when acquisitions and leased units are added, that figure will be reach 10,000.<\/p> <p>  The Bandon flood relief scheme will be completed this year, along with other flood relief schemes.  The projects upgrading the water supply in Drogheda and Dundalk will be completed this year and projects to address water quality and capacity in other towns and cities will also begin this year.  Sewerage schemes in Blanchardstown, Athlone and Liffey Valley will commence in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The majority of recent projects have been delivered on time and on budget, and I will highlight a few of them.  The N22 Tralee bypass was completed on time and at a cost of &euro;73.4 million, which is under budget.  The N25 Cork south ring road interchanges upgrade was completed at a cost of &euro;81.5 million, while the north docklands sewerage scheme was also completed.  The Waterford towns and villages wastewater project was also completed on budget at just under &euro;26 million, while phase 2 of the National Indoor Arena is expected to be completed ahead of schedule this March at a cost of &euro;26 million.  Notwithstanding the challenges that exist and which we will no doubt discuss later, this highlights the professionalism across many sectors in delivering public capital projects.<\/p> <p>  To support Departments as they work to achieve value for money in investment in capital infrastructure, a suite of key reforms has been introduced to support the efficient implementation of Project Ireland 2040 and its objectives.  The Land Development Agency has been set up by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure optimal use of State land.  Four new funds have been set up focused on urban and rural investment, climate action and disruptive technology to prioritise funding to the best projects, and they are being managed by the relevant line Department.  A construction sector group has been established to ensure regular and open dialogue between the Government and the construction sector, which is important in addressing various capacity and skills issues that exist in the sector, as well as the need for the Government and the system to work collaboratively with the sector in order to improve performance in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  A Project Ireland 2040 delivery board meets regularly to ensure effective leadership of the implementation overhaul.  The investment projects and programmes office has been established in my Department to co-ordinate reporting on Project Ireland 2040 and drive reforms, including strengthened business cases and project appraisal.  A capital projects tracker is published on our website to inform citizens of the variety of projects being implemented in their area and to give a greater overview to the construction and infrastructure sectors.  The tracker is currently being updated.  A capacity and capability review of public sector bodies is being commenced in the Department to ensure that the State's delivery practices are to the highest standard.  This reflects a concern that the capacity and performance of bodies varies, depending on historical role in delivering infrastructure.  Given the scale of this project and the demands placed on Department that would not previously have managed projects, it was necessary to carry out a review of that capability.<\/p> <p>  As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland's capital management systems, the Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction procurement strategy and we are reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on the processes that are in place to ensure the effective selection, appraisal, delivery and oversight of capital projects.  Let me stress that the management, delivery and oversight of individual investment projects within the agreed allocations is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister. The Government receives regular reports informing it of actual expenditure and my Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that actual expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  In addition, the drawing down of funds from the Exchequer is monitored and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the published Exchequer statement.<\/p> <p>  A range of processes and guidance is in place to support Departments and Ministers in securing value for money and I will discuss some of these as they relate to the public spending code and public procurement rules.  The public spending code is the set of rules, procedures, and guidance to ensure value for money in public expenditure.  The public spending code encompasses guidance on a variety of issues related to the management of expenditure at each stage of the expenditure cycle.  This includes central guidance on the application of appraisal and evaluation methodologies, including cost-benefit analyses.  The public spending code sets out the oversight and approval process for public expenditure proposals, including capital projects.  Governance and clear lines of responsibility are key to successful public capital investment.  The public spending code supports this by clearly setting out the responsibilities that lie with different roles.  These main roles are the sponsoring agency and the sanctioning authority.<\/p> <p>  The Department or agency proposing and implementing a project is the sponsoring agency.<\/p><p>It is responsible for appraisal, planning, implementation, management and post-project review of the project.  The sponsoring agency is responsible for developing a project proposal, which is then submitted to the sanctioning authority for decision on approval at key designated gates in the project lifecycle.<\/p><p> The Department or body funding the project and which is responsible for project approval is the sanctioning authority.  It is responsible for approval in principle at the key gates in the project lifecycle, that is, following appraisal, approval to proceed to tender, and approval to accept a tender if the project has significantly changed, such as through an increase in costs.  The sponsoring agency is responsible for managing and monitoring the implementation of the project.  The sanctioning authority must be satisfied that the agency has appropriate systems to ensure that the project is delivered in line with what has been approved.  If adverse developments occur which affect the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency must report to the sanctioning authority.<\/p><p> Sponsoring agency and sanctioning authority roles can lie within separate public sector bodies.  The relevant local authority will typically be sponsoring agency and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will be the sanctioning authority for a social housing regeneration project.  Sponsoring agency and sanctioning authority roles can also be within one body.  For example, for maintenance projects funded by local authorities, the local authority may be both the sponsoring agency and the sanctioning authority.  For larger projects costing more than &euro;100 million - and this is a key point - the Government is the ultimate sanctioning authority.  For practical purposes, in respect of these projects, the relevant Department will lead on that project.<\/p><p> The public spending code is supplemented in some instances by sector-specific appraisal guidance.  These are developed by the relevant Department and set out additional requirements and parameters specific to the sector while remaining in line with the public spending code.  In the transport sector, for example, specific rules and cost-benefit analysis of transport projects may differ from the cost-benefit approach in other areas of public policy.<\/p><p> Public procurement rules cover the acquisition of works, supplies and services by public bodies.  National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations.  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime.<\/p><p> The high-level review and reporting structures set out in the public spending code are key to better project management and form the basis of the guidance material on project management that is set out in the capital works management framework, which was first published in 2007.<\/p><p> All public works projects delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid out in the capital works management framework.  The framework is mandated by circular and was developed to provide an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their requirements.  The public works contract is a key component of the framework and is a lump sum, fixed-price contract which is used not on all projects but on most public works contracts.<\/p><p> This framework is maintained by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Government contracts committee for construction.  As mentioned, David O'Brien, who is with me today, is the chair of that committee.  The committee has representatives from all the main sanctioning authorities and bodies across the public service.  It is possible for public bodies to seek a derogation from the use of the standard forms of contract from the committee.  This process may be used for complex or large projects which have specific requirements that do not naturally fit with the standard \"lump sum\" contracts and has been availed of by a number of sanctioning authorities.  A derogation, if agreed, does not approve the approach or strategy of the authority but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such as to warrant a different approach from the standard.  It is a matter for the contracting authority and the sanctioning authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regard to compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the spending code.<\/p><p> Reform is an element of Project Ireland 2040.  We also have to learn from experiences, both good and bad.  There is no doubt but that the experience of delivering capital projects highlights the need to step up the pace of reform still further.  The delivery of large, complex, multi-year capital projects in a construction market impacted by shortened economic cycles brings many challenges in terms of tender price volatility, skills shortages, etc.  This is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently set out a further suite of reforms.<\/p><p> First, we need more certainty on project costs.  Government will no longer pre-commit to major bespoke projects until there is 100% clarity on tendered costs.  The Government will approve major projects to be evaluated and designed, but there will be no final commitment until the tendering process is complete.  It is not possible to know the price of a capital project with a high level of certainty unless there is a full design specification, planning, if necessary, has been achieved, and the project has been competitively tendered.  In future, Government will not commit to projects until the design and price are clear.  This could delay projects, which I know will be an issue, but will ensure greater cost certainty.  There is a trade-off between timeliness and core certainty regarding large bespoke projects because the time it can take to develop the detailed design, in many cases, can be years.  This certainly increases the cost but it also takes time.  Of course, it also involves expenditure up front.  Depending on a final decision on a project, that may involve expenditure which ultimately does not lead to an end product or a final build.<\/p><p> We need more realistic costs and a better understanding of costs in capital projects.  In future, the budgets of large bespoke projects will include a significant premium for risk in order that cost estimates are more realistic.  As risk is managed through the project lifecycle, the risk premium will reduce.  For example, a project on a brownfield site with a high degree of complexity and which has not been fully designed has a higher risk premium incorporated into its budget.  As the risk is managed, this premium should reduce over time.  The revised capital works management framework will require Departments and their agencies to improve the quality of information on projects as they are implemented.  This will improve decisions on projects and allow projects to use digital technologies such as building information modelling, BIM, to improve how efficiently they are developed.  This is another significant challenge for sanctioning authorities in ensuring that the information is there at the outset to ensure we can use the technology embedded in the BIM approach.  As part of the reviews of Ireland's capital management systems, my Department will conduct a full assessment of how cost estimation for capital projects could be improved.  This will include exploring the potential of external peer review of cost estimates for projects over a certain size.<\/p><p> We also need to strengthen our capital management systems.  As I mentioned, we are reviewing them.  The Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction strategy and we are reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to examine how capital projects are currently selected, designed and delivered and to strengthen these processes, taking account of lessons learned.  The reviews will result in a range of changes.  I will highlight just two changes at this point.  One is earlier identification of projects.  At present, Departments are typically presented with projects which are fully formed and in respect of which the delivery methods and project roles and responsibilities have been set.  In future, Departments will engage at an earlier stage to have more input into project roles and responsibilities; delivery method, critically; identification of risk; and discussion on costs.  Second, and finally, a number of high-profile projects have highlighted issues with the performance of advisory firms.

That being said, we are here to discuss Government contracts and in particular, the contract for the national children's hospital.  Hindsight is wonderful, of course, but from my perspective there are two flaws with that particular project, the first being the fact that it was two-stage and the second that there were additions and problems on site which have pushed the total expenditure up.  I am not sure that any Government Department was equipped with the necessary foresight to be able to determine that these problems were arising.  That is glaringly obvious when there are changes made to the manner in which Departments operate in terms of the note that Mr. Watt has provided to us in his opening statement.<\/p><p> I have five specific questions.  On the two-stage tender process, I do not understand and, to a certain extent, I do not accept that there was not an element of foresight in terms of understanding the difference between the two-stage process in the context of the ability of the Department in question to obtain a competitive tender on the basis of the complexity of what was being done on the ground.  As someone who worked briefly in the formwork business, I cannot understand how on earth a secondary company would be able to walk on site and say that it could tender, based on what is in the ground or what was supposed to be put in the ground, as per the original contract.  How was that considered appropriate?  Was there any knowledge in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that this was the nature of the contract?  Perhaps Mr. Watt or Mr. O'Brien could answer that.

Let us take ten off, that is, 42 meetings a year.  I do not believe it credible that Mr. Quinn would not say to Mr. Watt, \"Just to let you know what's going on down the road.

For a man of Mr. Watt's experience, given all the excellent projects that have worked out so well, which he rightly put on record as he is entitled to do and in which I support him in so doing, it is not remotely credible that Mr. Quinn did not fill him in on what is currently the largest project costing &euro;1.7 billion or whatever will be.  It is grand to say it is not in minutes and that they followed the correct procedures but I am putting it to Mr. Watt that it is not credible.<\/p> <p>  I am probably rushing but I have two very important points I want to raise and I know I will only get one bite of the cherry.  We were provided with a note from the Department of Health on 31 January arising from our earlier meeting.  It looks like we are heading for a cost of &euro;1.7 billion.  PwC are helping us, and Mr. Watt laid out a series of improvements for the next projects, but we are still faced with the public having to pay the bills for this project.  A footnote states: \"Exclusions include changes in scope, excess national construction tender inflation above 4% post July 2019, changes in legislation (e.g. VAT, PRSI, statutory labour rates, building regulations)\".  Let us focus on the construction tender inflation because I am conscious that this was subject of a \"Prime Time\" programme the other night but it was in a footnote of a document given to us in January.  According to AECOM Ireland's annual review and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland in respect of last year's performance and next year's projected performance, construction tender inflation has run at 7.5%, on average, in the past year and is likely to be no less than 7% in the year ahead.  Does that not mean, in effect, that the BAM-provided construction inflation exceeds the 4% that is budgeted for in the contract or that this briefing document would suggest, and that once construction inflation performs at broadly the same as last year, it is open season again on negotiations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#N02600","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551949200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>\"No\" is the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#N02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>What does it mean then?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#N02800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551949200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>If I understand, and, to repeat, I am not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#N02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>The head of contracts might know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#N03000","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551949200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I will answer the question but it is not for Mr. O'Brien either.

My questions relate to the Estimates process, the functionality of the Department, communications between Departments and circular 12\/2010.  These are my four topics and I hope to get through the four questions.<\/p> <p>  Article 28.4.4&deg; of the Constitution states, \"The Government shall prepare Estimates of the Receipts and Estimates of the Expenditure of the State for each financial year, and shall present them to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for consideration\" , while Article 17.1.1&deg; states the D&aacute;il \"shall consider such Estimates\".  I cannot get my head around the Estimates process we went through late last year and revised earlier this year.  We had a situation where Estimates were published on 9 October, which was budget day, and we had Revised Estimates on 19 December.  There was awareness in the Department of a massive overrun in the children's hospital.  The Constitution is clear that the Government \"shall prepare Estimates of the Receipts and Estimates of the Expenditure of the State for each financial year\", and they have to be done truthfully.  How can we say the Estimates done last October were done accurately and to the best ability of the Department?  How can we say the book of Revised Estimates of 19 December were also done in this way?  On 20 February in the D&aacute;il, when there were further Revised Estimates, the Taoiseach tacitly said they had to be re-profiled.  There had been awareness in the Department of the issues relating to the hospital, with regard to an assistant secretary, for some time and there was awareness in the Department on 19 November, as Mr. Watt has outlined, of the large overrun.  Were inaccurate Estimates given to the D&aacute;il last October and, subsequently, last December?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#O04500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551949200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The Estimates are prepared on budget day.  A summary Estimate is set out by the Minister on budget night.  Changes are then made.  This year there were very modest changes.  There are always technical issues as end year positions become clearer.  Then, as the Deputy has said, Revised Estimates are set out.  The implications for the children's hospital and what it meant for the allocations of Departments were not decided upon by the Government.  There was insufficient time for us, because the Government was debating, to recast the Estimates, and they were published because we are always anxious to publish them before the end of the year.  We do not publish them the following year.  We do not believe it is appropriate to publish the Estimates after the year has begun.  We now endeavour to publish them before the end of the year.  A decision was taken that we would publish the Estimates.  As the Deputy will be aware from his time in government, it is not unusual for the Government to publish its Revised Estimates at a time issues are outstanding that the Government may know might require a revision subsequently.  There were cases when the Deputy was a Minister, which I will not go through, when the same thing happened.

In 2015, the new hospital board appeared before this committee prior to my becoming a member of it.  As a result of previous issues relating to the original project, the new board appeared before this committee.  Absolute assurances were given to the committee that the board had learned its lessons, governance was in place and no issues would arise.  In the same way that Mr. Watt told us in his opening statement that the Department has learned lessons, the board stated at that time that it had learned the necessary lessons.  Did Mr. Watt look at the transcript of those proceedings?  He did not.  Well, I did.  I took the precaution of reading the transcript of that meeting and looking at what the board members said.  I then followed up regarding what the Department was to do.  It was to produce a report on what had been learned from the debacle that led to the meeting.

I do not expect Mr. Watt to address that issue but I expect him to be familiar with it and to know what was learned from it.  The board provided assurances.  Does Mr. Watt agree that its members were picked for their expertise?  Okay.  I regret that Mr. Quinn is not appearing before the committee today but that was the decision of the Department.  I went through the minutes of the board meetings on this matter.  The minutes of a meeting on 4 July 2018 note the lack of co-operation of all parties and that the guaranteed maximum price had not been agreed.  That had been an ongoing concern since earlier that year.  Nobody knew what was the guaranteed maximum price.  As the months go on, the minutes keep recording that concern.  At some stage, the board engaged an expert.  This took place under a two-stage process that the Department allowed and to which I will return if I have time.  The board was alerted to the high level of risk in July 2018.  A guaranteed maximum price had still not been agreed by August.  I ask Mr. Watt to listen to the following when he is ready.  Plan B was discussed by the board which noted that the performance of BAM during phase 1 up to that stage fell far short of what would be expected of a tier 1 contractor.  That is noted in the minutes.  I highlighted these issues when going through the minutes and I wondered what were the board and the contractor doing.  I am not commenting on that; I am asking a question.  In October the board remarked that BAM had not delivered, and questioned whether various design and contractor teams were fit for purpose to deliver a project of this scale and complexity.  Shall I repeat that or has Mr. Watt taken it on board?  In October the board noted that BAM had not delivered and questioned whether the design and contractor teams were fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#Q01500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551949200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to the minutes of meetings of the national children's hospital board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#Q01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#Q01700","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551949200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I am not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#Q01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>That is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#Q01900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551949200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>-----a member of the board or involved in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#Q02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I understand that.

The Committee would particularly like to focus on the Department's role in ensuring that value for money is achieved through systematic appraisal and professional management of all capital projects.<\/blockquote> <p>In light of this letter, the committee wrote a number of days ago to the Department asking it to list approximately the ten major projects that fall under this issue, and we got the list.  It starts off with MetroLink and goes on to the national children's hospital.  It then deals with the water supply project - eastern and midlands region, for which Irish Water has responsibility; the N20, Cork to Limerick; the Galway city ring road; the public private partnership, PPP, M11 project, Gorey to Enniscorthy; the greater Dublin area drainage scheme under Irish Water; the N21 to N69, which runs from Limerick to Adare to Foynes; the PPP N25, which is the Newross bypass; and the national broadband plan.  We have been here for over two hours and I am concerned, as Chairman, that we have not been sticking to the subject matter of the invitation.  We have spent most of our time dealing with one item, namely, the children's hospital.  I must make sure that this meeting is run in a balanced way that is fair to the members and the witnesses who were called to discuss the national capital plan, not solely one item.  As Chairman, I have a duty to ensure that the discussion aligns itself to the invitation.  The invitation did not refer to the national children's hospital specifically.

With regard to the list of projects Mr. Watt provided, many are roads projects and the lead authority would be the National Roads Authority, which has a great deal of expertise at this stage.  My county of Kildare, for example, has more motorway running through it than any other county due to the location of the N7, N9, N4 and so on.  The NRA is the lead authority for much of this and has great experience in those projects, and, essentially, it stays on budget and on target.  It is in the context of bespoke projects that the real problem arises.  We cannot really go into the national broadband plan, but a great deal has been said about the procurement process for that.  We cannot really discuss  MetroLink because it is a current project.

There is a degree of forensics required and the contractors are encouraged, through the process, to drive value for money.  That is partially why we have the competitive process.  It is to ensure we are getting the best possible price.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  If the price is determined to be abnormally low, then the contracting authority has an obligation to investigate, raise issues, seek clarification and reach its conclusions.  If the contracting authority is then of the view that the price is abnormally low, it may reject it but is not obliged to do so.

The line Ministers and Departments can have their views.  I asked Mr. Watt for his.  He has somewhat given me a response, but I want to test it in coming back to one report that examined this issue - the Mazars report.  It also looked at the cost overrun.  In general terms, it showed that the guaranteed maximum price had ballooned, that the design team had made guesses about the cost, that the value engineering savings had not materialised to a significant degree and that the philanthropy had fallen through, the accommodation to be provided by McDonalds being one example.  It also found that the procurement process had added to the cost overrun and that it raised questions about the fast-track two-stage tender procurement model.

We have set out the position.  The contracts committee had discussions with the national children's hospital board which came with a proposal and sought a derogation from the requirement for a lump sum contract.  It sought the derogation, as Mr. David O'Brien mentioned, because of the complexity of the project.

It is chaired by Mr. David O'Brien and there are people from different sanctioning authorities on it.  It is not the only derogation to be granted; there were ten projects in the past few years in respect of which derogations were granted.  A derogation was granted from the normal lump sum contract because it was the collective view of those on the committee that it would not have been possible to deliver the hospital project within the timescale and have a competitive process for it on the basis of a lump sum contract, given the inherent risks involved in such complex projects.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned, this goes back to the fact that when it comes to repeat projects such as motorway, school and primary care centre projects, we have a much better idea of the unit costs.

There should be a maternity hospital, a children's hospital and a general hospital.  People feel that it should be built on a greenfield site.  That is another issue and is a decision for the Government of the day.  I understand that it is not a decision for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  What effect will this have on other projects?  Mr. Watt spoke about the New Ross bypass, which is in my constituency, and other projects.  They are all going to be finished but there are other projects.  There are eight primary care projects in the pipeline.  These people have approached me because they feel the projects may be withdrawn.  The money for the children's hospital bill has to come from somewhere.

We are in March 2019 and we are informed that contracts are still being exchanged.  The language and accountability at this level is not acceptable.  We in Galway are left being told in February 2018 contracts had gone out to be signed and in 2019 we are told that they were not contracts but letters of offer and all sorts of waffle.

Agreed.  There are no matters arising that will not be dealt with in the course of the meeting.<\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first relates to briefing documents and opening statements from Departments.  These are Nos. 2034 and 2037, which we discussed this morning.  We note and publish them.<\/p> <p>  The second category relates to correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No. 2013B, dated 25 February 2019, is from Mr. Barry Donoghue, Deputy Director, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, providing information requested by the committee as follows: details relating fees paid to prosecuting counsel; public sector organisations that can initiate District Court prosecutions; delegation of prosecuting authority to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and statistics relating to outcomes of indictable cases.  We will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>  I draw attention to a matter which surprised me.  By way of information, there are 21 agencies of the State that can initiate prosecutions in their own right.  We all thought that only the Director of Public Prosecutions and one or two other agencies could do this.  The Health and Safety Authority, the Consumer Protection Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Central Bank, Road Safety Authority and the National Transport Authority may do so, while An Post may institute court proceedings in respect of television licences.  Gas Networks and ESB Networks may do so where people interfere with meters and equipment.  The matter arises of the general direction to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The latter deals with many of the cases in the District Court.  That is probably the background to that.  In the context of indictable cases, the Garda has sent us trial outcomes by year.  In 2018, there were 2,588 cases, with 2,410 convictions, a rate of 93%.<\/p> <p>  The correspondence contains details of fees paid to counsel under the following headings: Circuit Court; confiscation of assets; asset-seizing in the High Court and Supreme Court; the Central Criminal Court; books of evidence; consultations; the High Court; higher brief fees in judicial review cases; Supreme Court; High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court bail; Court of Appeal (criminal); sea fisheries - District Court; health and safety - District Court; and conferences.  Fees and refresher fees are given for senior and junior counsels.  People may read this and decide if it is a good profession to join.<\/p> <p>  No. 2016B is correspondence from Ms Maria Browne, Chief State Solicitor, providing information requested by the committee.  We asked about annual operating costs for the cost recovery unit which we are given.  We asked for details of the number of vacancies within the Chief State Solicitors Office including the length of time the vacancies have been open.  There is a detailed list of the 15 pre-existing vacancies and the status of efforts to fill posts.  It says Garda clearance can take a couple of months in some cases.  We understand that they must be particularly cautious.<\/p> <p>  We have also been given a note on the arrangements regarding lottery grant approval.  We raised this with the Chief State Solicitor's office.  When dealing with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and, in particular, the Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport, we have all encountered cases where grants could not be approved because they were with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.  We have been given the figures we asked for.  In 2017 there were 89 cases but in 2018 there are 264 cases, probably because the lottery applications were open in that year.  To date this year there have been 19 cases.  We will write back and inquire further because we have not been told how many cases were outstanding at the end of the year.  It is fine to tell us how many cases were received but we have no idea of how many were processed and how many are outstanding.  We have discussed delays.  The Chief State Solicitor's office gives various reasons for the delays but it does not give us a breakdown of the numbers outstanding at year&rsquo;s end.<\/p> <p>  No. 2018B is correspondence from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, HSE, providing follow up information on procurement arrangements for section 38 and 39 organisations and a note on any conflict of interest that may arise in relation to any former managers of the HSE being employed by section 38 and 39 organisations.  The note is a page and a half long, which we note and publish.<\/p> <p>  No. 2019B is from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, dated 27 February 2019 and providing information in respect of the operation of the criminal justice operational hub, including the timetable for its completion.  The hub will provide a centralised facility to allow for data to be exchanged between the existing ICT systems in the criminal justice agencies and accessed in an anonymised format for the purposes of researching and developing evidence-based policy.  He also provides a breakdown of compliance with data protection legislation and so on, which we asked for when he was before the committee.  We acknowledge his detailed response.<\/p><p>No. 2021B from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll provides information requested by the committee on the number of people who are not covered by free legal aid in cases before the Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court.  The letter states that 72,684 free legal aid certificates were granted in 2018.  I was curious about how many cases there were where that was not the case and am shocked that the correspondence states: &quot;The Courts Service advises that it does not have statistics in relation to the number of persons appearing before the courts who are not legally aided.&quot;  That means that it seems it does not have the total number appearing before the courts.  If it had the total number and knew the number who got free legal aid, the difference is those whose cases did not get free legal aid.  If it cannot provide that, it must not have the total figure.  The letter continues: &quot;It further advises that the position is that the majority of indictable offences dealt with summarily or on indictment in the Circuit and District Courts are covered by legal aid, however, most civil cases dealt with are not legally aided.&quot;  We need to write back and ask for the total number of cases processed through the different courts, including the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, etc.  I would have thought that was a basic figure.  It may have it.  We just need an indication of the scale and we will write back about that.<br\/><br\/>No. 2023B is from Mr. Paul O'Toole from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, dated 28 February 2019, providing information requested for our next periodic report, with regard to the independent Thorn review in Limerick.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>[The] University has implemented 9 of the 10 recommendations from Dr. Thorn's report on the University of Limerick. The remaining recommendation is in progress.<\/blockquote><p>It continues with regard to the Attorney General's advice about the review of spin-out companies.  We got a letter about that at the previous meeting and are aware of that.  It continues with regard to Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies:<\/p><blockquote>A draft report of the review has been prepared by Mazars consultants.  The HEA is reviewing this draft and will revert to the Committee at the earliest opportunity.<\/blockquote><p>We can incorporate that into the next periodic report.  We will note and publish that.<br\/><br\/>No. 2024B is from Mr. Brendan McDonagh, chief executive of NAMA, providing an update requested on the Player Wills and Poolbeg sites.  We will note and publish this.  We had considered this at the meeting before Christmas and asked for an update on both sites.  He makes it very clear with regard to the Player Wills site that the loans attached to the site were fully repaid at par value by the borrower in late December.  NAMA has nothing further to do with that site.  It is good news that the taxpayer got all the money back at par value.  I know many people hoped that site would be developed for housing or other purposes.  It is up to the private owner to develop the site but it is out of NAMA entirely.  With regard to the Poolbeg site, we mentioned the delays and he states:<\/p><blockquote>It is a matter of public knowledge that the Poolbeg West Planning Scheme is currently awaiting approval from An Bord Pleanala.  NAMA would welcome An Bord Pleanala's planning decision on the Poolbeg West Planning Scheme in early course as without that no proposed work on the site can commence.<\/blockquote><p>He hopes the committee can be of assistance with the matter.  The point is that the delays associated with that are not NAMA's fault so we will not include any of that in our periodic report.  We will note and publish that.<br\/><br\/>The next item is from Mr. Maurice Buckley of the Office of Public Works, relating to the premises in Galway that was mentioned when it looked at the Miesian Plaza for the Department of Health on Baggot Street with regard to measurements.  He states: &quot;The annual rent being paid reflects the final agreement reached between the OPW and the Landlord and therefore the OPW are satisfied that an overpayment of rent has not occurred.&quot;  We will take that as written to us.  We will note and publish that.  It is relevant to our periodic report.  There was an issue but it says it is satisfied.  That is as far as we can go.  We cannot tease that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019030700002#GG00200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551949200,"counter":829,"content":"<p>Of course it is satisfied, because it made the mistake.

He said that it was not a disciplinary matter.  That is the theme of everything here.  There are never disciplinary proceedings or tangible outcomes.  Repetition is, therefore, not deterred and is quite likely.  I think the OPW is something that we need to return to.  I was not happy with that as an answer.

The committee will be aware that my Department is not the sponsoring agency or sanctioning authority for this project.  In addition, I am not the Accounting Officer for it.  I have submitted a detailed document to the committee addressing the matters raised in the letter of invitation.  I do not propose to go through that in detail but I will take the opportunity to set out my Department's role in respect of capital projects in general, my Department's role in respect of the national paediatric hospital and the role of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, in the issues being discussed today.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's responsibility in overseeing the effective implementation of the national development plan, NDP, in respect of capital projects is to set the overall five-year multi-annual capital expenditure ceilings for each ministerial Vote group and settle with each Department how these multi-annual ceilings are reflected and refined in the annual Estimates, which are voted annually by the D&aacute;il.  Decisions on how and where these allocations are invested is a matter in the first instance for the relevant Minister and Department, in line with the conditions of the delegated sanction, that is, the formal approval to spend Vote moneys, which they receive via the relevant Vote section in my Department.  We monitor actual spend against monthly expenditure profiles based on information submitted by Departments to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's relevant Vote section, to keep track of aggregate spend by each Department compared with planned profile spend.  The Department does not approve expenditure at the individual project level.  Of course, for projects costing more than &euro;100 million, the Government is the sanctioning authority and we brief the Minister for Finance and give our views to the Minister in the context of debates at Government.  We maintain the national frameworks within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for, and value for money in, public expenditure, such as the public financial procedures and the public spending code.<\/p> <p>  The NDP and Project Ireland 2040 do not change the long established arrangements for oversight, monitoring and management of voted Exchequer resources.  Exchequer funding continues to be managed through the normal systems for control of voted funds.  Departments and agencies are still responsible for delivering their projects within their budget allocations.<\/p> <p>  Two features of capital expenditure are monitored each month: aggregate capital and carryover spend in the year to date, and compared to profile and spend in the previous year; and Departments which are significantly ahead of or behind profile in actual spend and the reasons for the variation.<\/p><p>Departments must provide an explanation for variances.  Where necessary, my Department liaises with Departments, through Vote sections, to ensure that significant variances in actual spend are addressed and overall expenditure stays on track over the course of the year.<\/p><p> End-of-year monitoring for December reviews the annual position, including comparing the percentage of the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, capital allocation spent compared to the previous ten years.  Any capital unspent by each Department is identified, along with the amount of carryover into the following year.  This important change, which was introduced a number of years ago, ensures that we do not have the practice of unnecessary spending at year end, that is, Departments trying to spend capital in a hurry towards the end of the year.  Instead, Departments are allowed to carry over amounts into the next year, which is a sensible approach from a budget management perspective.  The focus is on budgetary aggregates rather than performance on individual projects, which is the responsibility of individual Departments and Accounting Officers.<\/p><p> My Department has responsibility for the public spending code, which is the set of rules, procedures and guidance that ensure value for money in current and capital public expenditure.  It sets out the rules and guidance on the oversight and management of spending at each stage of the capital project life cycle, including by setting out the responsibilities that lie with different capital expenditure project roles; setting out appraisal requirements where differing levels of public expenditure will be incurred; and setting out approval requirements at different project stages.<\/p><p> The main roles in the context of responsibility for capital expenditure projects are the sponsoring agency and the sanctioning authority.  The Department or agency proposing and implementing a project is the sponsoring agency.  It is responsible for appraisal, planning, implementation, management and post-project review.  It is responsible for developing a project proposal, which is then submitted to the sanctioning authority for decision on approval at each designated stage, or gate, in the project life cycle.<\/p><p> The Department or body funding the project and responsible for project approval is the sanctioning authority.  The sanctioning authority must be satisfied that the sponsoring agency has the appropriate systems to ensure the project is delivered in line with the approval it has been given.  The sanctioning authority is responsible for approval in principle at the key designated stages in the project cycle, namely, following appraisal, approval to proceed to tender and approval to accept a tender if the project has significantly changed due to, for example, an increase in costs.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, for projects costing more than &euro;100 million, the Government is the sanctioning authority.  The day-to-day oversight functions in those instances are the responsibility of the relevant Department funding the project.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not the sanctioning authority for the majority of capital projects.  It is only the sanctioning authority for the capital projects funded by its Vote group, which account for less than 3% of overall voted capital expenditure.<\/p><p> To support Departments as they work to achieve value for money in capital infrastructure investment, a suite of key reforms have been introduced to support the efficient implementation of Project Ireland 2040.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, has been set up by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure the optimal use of State land.  Four new funds have been set up focused on urban and rural development, climate action and disruptive technology to prioritise funding to the best projects.  These are managed by the relevant line Departments.  The objective was to ensure an element of competitive tendering within the system to try to bring forward the best projects as early as possible for funding.<\/p><p> A construction sector group has been established to ensure ongoing dialogue between the Government and the construction sector.  A past criticism was that while the construction sector was delivering projects on behalf of the State, we did not have proper channels of communication.  We now have a group that meets to discuss the procurement, capacity and skills issues that impact upon the sector's ability to deliver on behalf of the Government and the taxpayer.<\/p><p> A Project Ireland 2040 board has been put in place and meets regularly to overview the overall implementation of the plan.  The investment projects and programmes office, IPPO, has been established in my Department to co-ordinate reporting on Project Ireland and drive reforms, including strengthened business case and project appraisal.  A capital projects tracker is published on my Department's website to inform citizens of the variety of projects being rolled out in their areas and to give a greater overview to the construction and infrastructure sectors.  The tracker is currently being updated.  A capability and capacity review of public sector bodies is being commenced by my Department to ensure that the State's delivery practices are to the highest standard.  There has always been a concern that capacity varies across elements of the public sector.  We understand and appreciate that and will undertake a review to ensure that all bodies charged with implementing the plan have the necessary expertise and skills.<\/p><p> As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland's capital management systems, the OGP is conducting a review of construction procurement strategy and my Department is reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery, with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.<\/p><p> In line with the public spending code provisions, the Government is the sanctioning authority for the national paediatric hospital and the day-to-day oversight functions of the sanctioning authority are the responsibility of the Department of Health.  My Department's role in that project involves setting out the overall five-year capital envelope ceilings for the health Vote and settling on the annual basis for these multi-annual ceilings to be reflected and refined in the annual Estimates submitted to the D&aacute;il for its approval.  Decisions on which projects to invest in is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and his Department in line with the \"delegated sanction\" for overall capital expenditure.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's role also involves monitoring actual spend against monthly profiles based on information submitted to its Vote section so as to keep track of aggregate spend by each Department compared to planned spend.  We maintain the national frameworks within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for, and value for money in, public expenditure, such as the public financial procedures and the public spending code.  Responsibility for compliance with the national frameworks is a matter for the relevant Accounting Officer, who is the Secretary General of the Department of Health in respect of the project in question.<\/p><p> The committee will be aware that the OGP is a division of my Department.  The OGP leads on the implementation of the Government's procurement reform programme.  It provides procurement solutions, advice, guidance and systems for public bodies, promoting good practice and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the health, education, defence and local government sectors through the procurement executive.  It also has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement.  This framework enables a more strategic, consistent and co-ordinated approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procedures to be followed by public bodies.<\/p><p> Public works procurement is covered by the capital works management framework, CWMF.  This consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents.  It is mandatory for use on all projects delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the public capital programme.  The CWMF is maintained by the construction policy unit of the OGP in consultation with the Government contracts committee for construction, GCCC.  Mr. David O'Brien, who is present, is the chair of that committee.  The OGP has no direct involvement in works procurement, with the exception of the framework for rapid-build social housing.  Capital works are procured directly by the many public bodies tasked with delivery of the public capital programme.<\/p><p> Regarding the paediatric hospital, the responsibility for the day-to-day oversight rests with the Department of Health.  The role of the GCCC in this instance was to consider a request for a derogation by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board from the use of the standard forms of contract.  A request for a derogation may be used for complex or large projects that have specific requirements that do not naturally fit with the standard \"lump sum\" contracts.  Since 2011, there have been 12 derogations from the lump sum contract.  Not all of them has gone through the two-stage process used in respect of the children's hospital, as there are other forms.  It is unusual, but not unique, that derogations are sought and given.  The derogation acknowledges that the particular circumstances warrant a different approach.  It does not approve the approach or strategy and the responsibility for the public procurement process rests with the contracting authority.<\/p><p> Reform is part and parcel and a key element of Project Ireland, but we also have to learn from experiences, both positive and negative.  There is no doubt that the experience of delivering capital works in recent years highlights the need to step up the pace of reform still further.  The delivery of large, complex, multi-year capital projects in a construction market that is impacted by a shortened economic cycle brings many challenges in terms of tender price volatility, skills shortages, etc.  This is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently set out a further suite of reforms.  We need more certainty on project costs.  The Government will no longer commit to major bespoke projects until there is clarity on tendered costs.  It will approve major projects to be evaluated and designed, but there will be no final commitment until after the tendering process is complete.  It is not possible to know the price of a capital project with a high level of certainty until there is a full design specification, any necessary planning has been achieved and the project has been competitively tendered.  In future, the Government will not commit to projects until the design and price are clear.  This could delay projects, leading to commentary and angst about delays, but it will ensure greater cost certainty.  There is a trade-off between speed of delivery and cost certainty in respect of large, complex projects, in particular.<\/p><p> We need more realistic costs and a better understanding of costs in capital projects.  In future, the budgets of large bespoke projects will include a significant premium for risks so that cost estimates are more realistic.  As risk is managed through the project cycle, the risk premium should reduce.<\/p><p>For example, a product on a brownfield site with a high degree of complexity which has not been fully designed would have a higher risk premium incorporated into its budget.  As the risk is managed, the premium should reduce.  The risk premium of a standard project such as a school, primary care centre or road, where we have lots of experience of building similar projects, is commensurately lower than that of a larger once-off bespoke project.  The revised capital works management framework will require Departments and their agencies to improve the quality of information on projects as they are implemented.  This will improve decisions on projects and allow projects to use digital technologies such as building information modelling to improve the efficiency of their delivery.  As part of the reviews of our capital management systems, my Department will conduct a full assessment of how cost estimation for projects could be improved.  This will include exploring the potential for external peer review of cost estimates for projects over a certain size.<\/p><p> Moreover, we need to strengthen our capital management systems.  As I mentioned, we are reviewing our management system.  The Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction strategy and we are reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to examine how capital projects are currently selected, designed and delivered and to strengthen these processes, taking into account lessons from the range of projects that have been completed.  The reviews will result in a range of changes.  I would like to flag two of these at this stage.  One change will be earlier identification of projects.  At present, Departments are typically presented with projects which are fully formed or for which the delivery method and project roles and responsibilities have been set.  We believe that Departments should engage at an earlier stage to have more input into roles and responsibilities, delivery method, identification of risks and costs.  That process should take place earlier in the life cycle, particularly with larger projects.  Second, several high-profile projects have highlighted issues with the performance of advisory firms.  We propose to link payments to advisory firms to clear performance standards.  We will bring in performance standards linked to payments in future contracts with those firms.<\/p><p> I hope I have set out our Department's role in relation to the children's hospital.

We adopted a two-stage process which involved significant preliminary expenditure, spending &euro;200 million on preliminary works.  There was a commitment to finalise the design and move to phase two of the project.  There was a view at the time of the signing of phase 1 of the contract that there was certainty about the approximate bill of quantities.  That did not turn out to be the case.  The estimates of how certain we were about the Bill of quantities were not correct.  The Bill of quantities increased very significantly compared with what was included in the project.  The reasons for the cost increase from the Government decision in spring 2017 to where we are now are set out very clearly.  Most of the increase relates to remeasurement of the bill of quantities.  There was some design scope creep.  Some value engineering savings were not delivered and other matters played a part.  The Mazars report and other discussions have very clearly set out the reasons for the increase in prospective costs.  We are working through what that means for future procurement.  That is what I have been trying to outline today.  One lesson is not to commit to projects until we have absolute certainty about costs and to ensure that we have detailed designs which form the basis for any cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019030700002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551969000,"counter":872,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Watt saying that the biggest problem was the fact that this was a two-stage process?

It asks questions about other non-construction costs amounting to &euro;300 million, whether that figure will increase and if it is now a project that will cost over &euro;2 billion, which would make it the most expensive hospital in the world.  It appears from the content and tone of the email that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was put out by the fact that it had not been informed of this increase.  It acknowledges that there were some discussions on it at budget time, but there was no detail.

Many estimates before it are general in nature, particularly when it comes to once-off projects.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the overall management of budgets, I am happy to defend the management of the public finances in the past few years.  When I was appointed to this role, the fiscal deficit was 15%, the banking system was bust, our international reputation was in tatters and we could not raise money on the financial markets.  The rate of unemployment is now 5%; we have a balanced budget; the yields on ten-year money are 100 basis points and so forth.  I am happy, therefore, to defend the role of the Department and my colleagues in the Department of Finance in managing the public finances.<\/p> <p>  To respond on this issue, the figure is &euro;100 million for 2019.  In the context of this project, clearly the overruns are very significant, at 40%, 50% and 60%, depending on which element of the budget one is discussing.  The figure of &euro;100 million has to be seen in the context of a capital budget for 2019 that is being increased by &euro;1.5 billion and an overall capital budget of &euro;8 billion.<\/p><p>If I use words like \"not material\", people out there will spin it as if I said that it is not significant.

The capital plan, by its nature, is an iterative plan.  There is a figure of &euro;116 billion set out there and a whole variety of projects will be funded within that.  How these projects are funded and the timeframe for projects, as the Deputy will know, changes.  One school will be ready before another one, there will be delays with one school so another school is prioritised and so on.  The same applies with primary care centres, roads projects and so on.  It is an iterative process involving many different actors and it will evolve over time.

It seems to me that the contractors are able to call the shots on variations, although Mr. Watt has said that they will have to prove their case.  Is there an effective cartel in operation among a chosen group of contractors?  The Taoiseach was in Lisbon last week and I did some research on hospital projects in Portugal.  A hospital is being built there at the moment comprising 875 rooms, so it is much bigger than our children's hospital.  It is expected to come in at &euro;330 million or, to round it off, less than &euro;400 million.  Did Mr. Watt and his Department or the Department of Health have a look at comparative costings of hospitals in different parts of the world?  When this project was originally mooted, I did that.  I visited children's hospitals when I went to the USA for St. Patrick's Day.  The Irish national children's hospital is stunningly expensive and Mr. Watt has not explained why that is so.  He made reference to the fact that it is being built on a brownfield site.  Let us say that a brownfield site adds 10% or 15% to the cost.  I am prepared to accept that but I ask Mr. Watt to explain to us, on behalf of taxpayers, how we got it so incredibly wrong.  Is there a cartel in operation?  It seems that contractors are pitching at particular prices but those prices are only a first guesstimate and they get inflated afterwards.  How does that happen in Ireland when similar projects in other countries are coming in at a much lower cost?  I know that wage costs in other countries may not be exactly the same but even in places like California, hospital projects are cheaper than they are here.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt is aware of the section 38 and 39 institutions that rely on the State for capital funding.  I am talking specifically about hospice developments around the country.  A voluntary project to build a hospice for one or even two counties will involve a huge amount of voluntary fundraising.  Mr. Watt will know about the project in Blanchardstown which has been ongoing for years.  At the end, the State comes in and tops up the funding to finish off the development and allow the hospice to open.  Mr. Watt just said that &euro;100 million is manageable but what is going to happen this year to the section 38 and 39 organisations that are due to receive capital funding?  A sum of &euro;100 million is a lot in the context of their projects.  Can Mr. Watt say that no hospice in the country will be delayed for funding reasons?  Where will the &euro;100 million come from?  We have heard from the Taoiseach and a range of Ministers that it will be &euro;3 million off this and &euro;3 million off that in a range of Departments.  The Department of Health is offering up some of the budgetary reductions so what is going to happen to the section 38 and 39 allocations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019030700002#H01500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1551969000,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019030700002#H01600","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551969000,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Part of what we have tried to do with Project Ireland 2040 is set out a pipeline of projects and try to attract home some of the consulting and construction teams which left for the Middle East, Australia or Canada during the crash, which is something we have debated.  Nevertheless, I agree with the Deputy that there is an issue, although I would not describe it as a cartel, given that such behaviour would be a legal offence.  I am not covered by privilege at the committee and, therefore, I will not comment in that regard.  It is certainly the case that a small number of contractors bid for these projects, which would have implications for the competitive nature of any competition.  It is not fair in any way to suggest I am belittling the additional costs associated with this project.  I am not and we have been very serious about it since we realised there was an issue.  The sum of &euro;100 million, however, needs to be considered in the overall context.  We should not give the impression to taxpayers and citizens that no projects are delivered on time or on budget.<\/p><p> In fact, as members will know better than I, the vast majority of projects such as primary schools, secondary schools, primary care centres, motorways and other roads are delivered through lump sum tender contracts where the price comes below, at or slightly above where we tendered.  It is not fair, therefore, to characterise the case of the national children's hospital as a fair representation of the generality of product delivery in the State.  Rather, it is fair to learn lessons from the project, particularly the circumstances of dealing with large bespoke projects, and the merits of different options.  Our focus is on trying to ensure that the public spending code is reinforced, that procurement policy is reinforced and that we do all we can to ensure that we get value for money for future projects.  While it is not meant as an excuse, there has been some debate or chat that Dermot Bannon's kitchen extension would not be dealt with in this way but that comparison is utterly facile and is of no relevance to the discussion whatsoever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019030700002#H01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551969000,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>Who made that comparison?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019030700002#J00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551969000,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>I am not saying the Deputy did.

The emails and correspondence, or at least the timeline for those discussions, have been set out in the public domain.  We raised issues with the governance because of its complexity and we wanted to ensure that whoever was given responsibility for managing the project, that is, the sponsoring agency, had the necessary expertise.  That led to the decision to establish the children's board, which comprised people with significant experience, mostly in the private sector where people had experience dealing with large projects.  Tom Costello, for example, who chaired the board, had worked for Sisk for 30 years in Ireland and elsewhere, while other people on the board had a whole variety of relevant qualifications.  We had discussions about governance because we were concerned about it and wanted to ensure there was clarity as to which body was the sponsoring entity and which body was the sanctioning authority that would manage the oversight on a daily basis on behalf of the Government.  They were our concerns and we raised them consistently.<\/p> <p>  I am not allowed to discuss Government memos because they are covered by other procedures but, as the Minister for Health and the Secretary General at the Department of Health have set out, the Government memo of 2017 outlined the governance structure.  At that point, we were satisfied that the governance structure could deliver the project.  Long before my time, the Department had consistently raised issues with the cost of the project, which has been running for 20 or 30 years.  In 2012, there was the issue with the Mater hospital site and there was the decision where the planning permission was refused.  We went back to the drawing board and the then Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, came forward with a review of the different options.  It was decided that the hospital would be co-located with St. James's Hospital and then it was off and running.  We had significant problems with the cost of the project and how we could manage it given its scale.  We made those concerns known to the Department and they were consistently set out in observations on memos during that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019030700002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1551969000,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>The Department still lacked a mechanism whereby overruns would be identified and reported to Mr. Watt, as Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019030700002#J00800","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551969000,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>The procedure for spending is to relate the actual spending to the profile, following which the senior levels of the Department would be alerted to any variance.

I do not think it would have happened that we would be in a position to set out the detailed design required to have a competitive competition for a lump sum contract.

I was not involved in the selection process and, as the Deputy knows, I am not involved with the sanctioning agency or authority, but I understand BAM's tender was lower than others.  There is a variety of reasons for the escalation in costs.  These relate to the bill of quantities, the design scope, and simulations of value engineering.  Debate will take place about how fault is apportioned out between the different players, but it is not the case that this is all BAM's problem.  That is clearly not the case.  There might be issues there in respect of the value savings.  I have not thought about it in those terms but I do not think it is as straightforward as that.<\/p> <p>  Issues around abnormally low tenders have been raised.  That raises a whole variety of questions.  If, for example, we were building a motorway and a tender came in that was &euro;100 million lower than the second cheapest tender and it became apparent that, for some reason, the National Transport Authority had decided not to go with that lowest tender, the Committee of Public Accounts and everybody else would have the NTA in and would be saying that it was an absolute disgrace that the lowest tender was not picked.  How does one construct a process which ensures that people do not come in low and then fight for increases?  That is the issue.  The way to stop that is to have the best quality information.  As Mr. O'Brien pointed out to me repeatedly, the best information possible and very clear and detailed designs will ensure that, when it comes down to it, there will not be that level of dispute.  If the design is specified one will of course have the normal adversarial discussions, because contractors try to maximise the benefit to themselves, but one will not have the type of issues that can lead to significant problems with delivery on budget.  <\/p> <p>  I am getting there in a roundabout way but, on the issue of abnormally low tenders, one could debate - and we have had these debates - whether one should give top marks for bidding close to the median price.  There is, however, then a danger that everybody will try to guess the median price and will cluster around it.  One will then not have the type of competition one wants.  There has been discussion on changing the weighting.  It has been suggested that less weight should be given to price and more to non-price factors.  However, if one is building a school, a school is a school.  What are the factors that will enable one to determine the winning bid?  All those tendering will say that they will build a school.  The factor on which a decision is made is the price.  Can a competition be constructed that ensures that non-price factors are significant?  Can other criteria be introduced into the system?  <\/p> <p>  There a big policy issue with respect to abnormally low tenders, but I do not have the solution.  No solutions are immediately obvious or clear from our perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019030700002#M01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1551969000,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>Let me pose a solution, which is to have a State construction company to take on these big projects.

Who is responsible for the &euro;450 million overspend?  It has a knock-on effect, that is, as prescribed but not necessarily teased out, the &euro;100 million this year but there are multiples of &euro;100 million for the next number of  years, which will force the same Taoiseach and others to row back on commitments they have been making for the past year or two since they announced the Project 2040 capital development plan.  They have been slow to do that but they were very quick to tell different constituencies how they would benefit.  I am told we will get more details on that in the spring economic statement.  The people on the contracts committee are the ones who granted a derogation from the way this is normally done.  They did that based on information and a recommendation by the board or a sub-committee of the board.  That allowed the Government to sanction it because it was happy that the contracts committee was involved.  I would like to see a written list of the members of the contracts committee.  Who are they?  Who appointed them?  What responsibility and expertise do they have because it further appears that when that application was made to them, they took the word of the board and the information that was available to it?  The committee never questioned, scrutinised or analysed the bill of quantities or the expertise behind that document.  I would have thought it may be standard practice in the private sector for an independent assessment of that but maybe these guys are so expert in their own fields they did not need that.  That is why I want to see who they are or what they are because it would appear they took what was presented to them hook, line and sinker.

The Estimate figure of &euro;464 million takes account of the rescheduling of funding to programme A, flood risk management, that was within the original Estimate I presented to the committee on 12 February.  During my attendance at the previous committee meeting I outlined how the 2019 allocation for flood risk management would support both capital infrastructural and non-infrastructural work to mitigate flooding and provide much needed protection for homes and businesses.  I reiterate the Government's commitment within the national development plan of &euro;1 billion for flood risk management.  The rescheduling of funds in no way undermines my commitment to achieve the targets outlined in the 29 flood risk management plans published in 2018 or the 119 new projects to be undertaken in addition to the 35 projects included in the existing programme.  This work will be progressed in the next decade and provide protection for 95% of the properties assessed in the plans to be at significant flood risk.<\/p> <p>  The OPW will consider all possible options to mitigate any negative impact of the rescheduling of funds from the original Estimate presented to the committee.<\/p><p>The OPW currently has ten flood relief projects at construction stage, 25 schemes at design and planning stages and an additional 57 new projects from the flood risk management plans which I announced in May 2018 on which further design work will be advanced during 2019.  As the committee will be aware, the progression of these projects is dependent on many variables.  Hence, the OPW will review progress throughout 2019 in order to assess where the rescheduling of funds is most effectively allocated.  I fully support the OPW in this exercise and reassure the committee that all projects will be delivered in the quickest possible timeframe.<\/p><p> There is no change to the 2019 Estimates funding of &euro;355 million previously presented to the committee regarding estate management, which supports the OPW in the provision of accommodation for civil servants and the ongoing enhancement, maintenance and preservation of the State&rsquo;s heritage sites and monuments.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members and administrators for the speed in scheduling the reconsideration of the OPW 2019 Estimates and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019030700002#B00400","speaker":"1363","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551952800,"counter":1385,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte riomh an Aire St&aacute;it.

I have been answering frequent parliamentary questions on the matter.  I want to do something with these premises because many closed stations are lying idle.  I met with the Garda Commissioner recently.  I put forward proposals regarding some stations that could be given back to the local community through the local authorities.  That could be for a community hall, a boxing club or whatever it might be.  I want to deliver on that for communities all around the country.  We will offer some closed Garda stations to the housing authorities, to the local authorities and to the Land Development Agency.  If they do not want them, those premises will be sold.  I am confident that a number of the remaining closed stations will reopen in the near future.  <\/p> <p>  The Chair asked at the last meeting for a list of all vacant properties.  As can be seen from that list, most of those properties are closed Garda stations and we need to do something with them.  There is no point having those buildings empty and unused.  They are costing taxpayers money each year to secure them, make them more presentable and ensure they do not fall into disrepair.  Some of the closed stations have already gone to wrack and ruin and it has been suggested they could be used for parking.  I support that.  I have sent a list to the Garda Commissioner and I also have to meet with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.

Donegal Mountain Rescue does not have a base and that raises health and safety questions because its equipment has to be checked.  It is very difficult for the organisation to do that at the moment.

That area, however, is within the remit of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his Department.  I am seeking to meet with the Minister and his officials because I foresee problems arising around the coast.  We dealt with one such issue recently in Dublin.  It seems to have been a successful operation and has protected a number of homes.  I would like to see that approach extended around the country and I will speak to Deputy Pearse Doherty about that during my visit to Donegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019030700002#D00900","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1551952800,"counter":1408,"content":"<p>That is appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019030700002#E00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1551952800,"counter":1409,"content":"<p>To follow on from the discussion on Garda stations, the comment on most of the stations listed is that the decision on future use is on hold pending the outcome of the Government review.

The Kilkenny flood relief scheme was one of the biggest in the country.  In spite of the size of the scheme and the fact that the area has not flooded since, residents of John's Quay in Kilkenny city still find it difficult to get insurance cover.  I raised the specific question of insurance companies taking information from the report on the website.  I am asking that in meetings with the insurance companies, or Insurance Ireland, the Minister of State highlight the fact that insurers are treating some residents unfairly.  The example I gave the Minister of State the last time he was before the committee was of an area which had never flooded, yet the residents cannot get insurance cover or sell their properties.  When there was flooding at John's Quay, millions of euro was spent on the flood relief scheme, but some of the residents are still having difficulties in getting insurance cover.  If the Minister of State has ongoing meetings with the insurance companies, or their representatives, will he, please, bring pressure to bear on them where insurers are being unfair and unreasonable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019030700002#E02000","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1551952800,"counter":1428,"content":"<p>I took note of that issue on the last occasion and will raise it when I meet the insurers.

If the Chairman brings an individual case to my attention, I will work with the insurance companies to find a solution.<\/p> <p>  I also point out that all maps are regional; there are no individual, house by house, maps.  There is no advantage to any insurance company in using them.  At the risk of being parochial, in my town of Athlone the house in which I was born and reared is 33 feet above road level on a hill and my father could not get insurance cover because it was deemed to be in a flood risk area.  We had to fight with the insurance company, but we eventually managed to get insurance cover.  I agree with the Chairman that in some cases insurance companies are being unfair, but they are working with people.
