Reducing waiting time for patients for operations and procedures is a key priority for Government. Last year saw a considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018.\u00a0 This was from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017, and represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting in excess of 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019.\u00a0 The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. Under the plan, the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment and retention of consultants has been examined by the Public Sector Pay Commission. \u00a0The Commission found that evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications\u00a0was indicative of on-going difficulties regarding the\u00a0recruitment of\u00a0consultants.\u00a0The Commission acknowledged that the difference in pay between the pre-existing and new entrant consultants is greater than that for other categories of public servants. It proposed that the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential. <\/p>  <p>  The Government accepted the Report of the Commission and recognises that there are significant recruitment and retention challenges\u00a0in relation to consultant posts. The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed. The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of medical consultants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200058#WRA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200058#WRA02850"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[27818\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200058#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which it is planned to address the funding challenges which are impeding the move from congregated settings in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>The Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo; proposes a new model of support in the community moving people from Congregated settings to the community in line with Government policy.

The Commission, in both the 2018 Annual Report and in the Inspector's Report, identified areas of low compliance in certain Approved Centres.

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has provided my Department with data on\u00a0the number of patients resident in Cavan and Monaghan who were present on an Inpatient\/Daycase and Outpatient Orthopaedics waiting\u00a0list, broken down by hospital. <\/p>  <p>  The data shows that there are 76 patients from Cavan\/Monaghan on the IPDC Orthopaedics waiting list, which represents 0.8% of the National orthopaedics waiting list. 43% of the patients from Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan are listed on the Cappagh Hospital IPDC orthopaedics Waiting list. The Cappagh Hospital IPDC Orthopaedic waiting list has decreased by 5% when compared to the same period last year and 96% of patients are waiting 9 months or less.<\/p>  <p>  The NTPF data also shows that there are 2,122 patients from Cavan\/Monaghan on the Outpatient Orthopaedic waiting list, which represents 3% of the National orthopaedics waiting list. 73% of the patients from Cavan\/Monaghan are on the Cavan General Hospital Outpatient Orthopaedics waiting list, and of these 61% of patients are waiting 12 months or less.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health\/HSE\/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient\/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan\u00a0places a strong focus on\u00a0ten\u00a0high-volume Inpatient\/Day Case procedures, including hip\/knee replacements. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.<\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List.\u00a0Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part\u00a0the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives\u00a0may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of outpatient\u00a0appointments approved to date relate to 4 high-volume specialities, specifically Ophthalmology, ENT, Orthopaedics, and Dermatology. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department\u00a0is working with\u00a0the HSE and\u00a0NTPF,\u00a0under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200059#WRB05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200059#WRB05750"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[27759\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200059#WRB05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the review of ambulance services in Arklow and west County Wicklow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200059#WRB05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200059#WRB05950"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[27966\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200059#WRB06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the waiting times for disability services for children in south County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.  <\/p>  <p>  In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The Defence Capital envelope for the period 2018-2021 is &euro;416m, and this will enable investment in major equipment platforms, including the continuing replacement and refurbishment of Naval Service Vessels.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet. A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. The fourth ship in the programme, L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, was commissioned into service in May 2019 reflecting an investment by the Government of over &euro;250 million in the new ships programme since 2010. The four ships are performing well in operational service. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the recent acquisitions to the Naval Service fleet, three ships in the current flotilla are over 30 years old (L&Eacute; Eithne and L&Eacute; Ciara were built in 1984 and L&Eacute; Orla was built in 1985).  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) which will be enabled for helicopter operations and will also have a freight carrying capacity. It is the intention to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. The cost of the MRV will only be known once the tender competition is concluded. <\/p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200061#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200061#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[27842\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200061#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the estimated cost of restoring military allowances to pre-FEMPI levels.","asker":"1369","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p>It is estimated that the cost of restoring Defence Forces allowances (excluding Military Service Allowance) to pre-FEMPI levels could cost in the region of &euro;7 million.

The demolition of Palestinian homes, and demolition or seizure of related structures such as water tanks, wells, solar panels, schools and animal housing, are cruel and unjust actions. The only possible conclusion we can draw from the systematic nature of these policies, especially in areas where illegal Israeli settlements have already been constructed, is that they are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland joined the European Commission-led West Bank Protection Consortium in 2017 at my instigation, during my first visit to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Consortium plays a leading role in supporting threatened communities and coordinating the provision of essential services to them, including material assistance and legal aid. Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Consortium underlines our commitment to reducing the vulnerability of Palestinian communities living in Area C of the West Bank.<\/p>  <p>  My primary concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families. But it is right that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers should also be pursued. Ireland is part of a group of EU Member States which pursue this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium.  It is the practice of the Consortium to raise this directly with the Israeli authorities and to date, the donors to the Consortium have sought compensation in the amount of over &euro;121,000 in respect of confiscated or demolished assets. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2018, seven donor-funded humanitarian structures were confiscated by the Israeli authorities from two vulnerable Palestinian communities located in Area C of the occupied West Bank. The structures were co-funded by the EU and the West Bank Protection Consortium, and were provided in order to address the basic needs of the population and to support children&rsquo;s right to education in a safe environment as part of a humanitarian response mechanism. <\/p>  <p>  There were worrying reports that the confiscated humanitarian assets were to be auctioned by the Israeli Civil Administration earlier this month, but I understand that the auction has since been postponed.  Irish diplomats based in Ramallah and in Tel Aviv are following this matter closely and are working with other members of the Consortium to determine how best to pursue this issue. <\/p>  <p>  The practice of demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education infrastructure, is contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under International Law, including provisions of international humanitarian law, and in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention. These practices also cause suffering to ordinary Palestinians, and impinge on the right of children to an education.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland regularly conveys our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU.

We remain fully committed to its preservation and full implementation, which is in the security interest of all. We share the US view that Iran's ballistic missile activities should be curtailed, and that its regional activities have exacerbated and prolonged conflicts.

This view was also directly shared with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo by HR\/VP Mogherini in her consultations with him in May. The EU has expressed deep regret at the continuing US efforts to tighten general economic sanctions on Iran, and also at Iran&rsquo;s subsequent decision to partially suspend its operation of some commitments under the JCPOA, including limitations on its stocks of nuclear materials. We are also very concerned about the attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, for which there can be no excuse. No party has yet claimed responsibility for these.

Section 32D and 32E of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, provide that the Central Bank Commission may make regulations relating to the imposition of levies and fees on the financial services sector in respect of the recoupment of the costs of financial regulation. <\/p><p>As it stands, the financial services industry currently funds 80% of the costs incurred by the Central Bank for financial regulation, with certain exceptions. [Banks which had participated in the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme, namely AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, which are required to fund 100% of the Central Bank's regulatory costs. The levies for Credit Unions are currently capped at 0.01% of total assets as at 30 September in the previous year. As a result, the Credit Union sector currently funds approximately 9% of the cost of their regulation.] This means that the subvention from the Central Bank amounts to approximately 20% of the total cost. What this translates to in monetary terms will be determined by the resources required by the Bank to discharge its legal responsibilities during a given year. <\/p><p>As until now, levies were based on estimates, at the end of each year, budgeted income and expenses are compared with actual income and expenses by the Central Bank, on a category by category basis, in order to arrive at the amount over (surplus) or under (deficit) recovered from Industry. Deficits are added to the amount to be raised from Industry in the following year while surpluses are deducted. <\/p><p>In 2018, the cost of financial regulation activities was funded by levies of approximately &euro;128 million and subvention of &euro;66 million. However, there was a deficit carried forward from 2017, which meant that the actual amount of Levy income raised from industry for 2018 was approximately &euro;137 million.<\/p><p><b><i>Table 1: 2018 Levy Income by sector (extracted from Note 40, 2018 Financial Statements of the Central Bank)<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>Sector<\/th><th>2018 Levy Amount<\/th><th>2018 Levy Income including deficit from 2017 Levy Amount<\/th><th>% of total 2018 Levy Income<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;000<\/td><td>&euro;000<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Credit Institutions<\/td><td>54,751<\/td><td>59,753<\/td><td>43.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Insurance Undertakings<\/td><td>35,647<\/td><td>35,002<\/td><td>25.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Intermediaries &amp;amp; Debt Management Firms<\/td><td>6,098<\/td><td>5,925<\/td><td>4.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Securities &amp;amp; Investment Firms<\/td><td>19,894<\/td><td>23,594<\/td><td>17.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Investment Funds<\/td><td>5,508<\/td><td>5,418<\/td><td>4.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Credit Unions<\/td><td>1,665<\/td><td>1,665<\/td><td>1.2%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Moneylenders<\/td><td>887<\/td><td>741<\/td><td>0.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Approved Professional Bodies<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>0.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bureaux de Change<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Home Reversion, Retail Credit &amp;amp;   Credit Servicing Firms<\/td><td>1,371<\/td><td>2,601<\/td><td>1.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Payment Services &amp;amp; E-Money   Institutions<\/td><td>1,270<\/td><td>1,875<\/td><td>1.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Funding<\/td><td>127,136<\/td><td>136,596<\/td><td>100.0%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>More information on the 2018 levies and levy income, and a more detailed version of Table 1, can be found in the Central Bank's 2018 Annual Report, available at the following link: <\/p><p>If industry was fully charged, there would be no subvention, however, there are certain costs (e.g. markets supervision) which it may be appropriate to continue to subvent on an ongoing basis where the costs cannot be attributed to specific firms but do relate to the orderly function of markets and the financial stability agenda.<\/p><p>In 2015, the Department of Finance and Central Bank of Ireland issued a joint public consultation on &lsquo;Funding the cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95).  <\/p><p>In response to that consultation, my predecessor as Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, agreed to a phased movement towards 100 per cent Industry Funding in order to eliminate subvention, by the taxpayer, of regulatory costs. Since then, recovery rates have increased in stages across most industry sectors, determined on a yearly basis. Now, in order to give greater clarity to industry, I have approved the trajectory to bring the recovery rate of levies across sectors to 100 per cent over the coming years.  This change in policy will apply the user pays principle to the regulation of financial services. <\/p><p>The following table shows the planned trajectory for levy rates across all sectors. Credit Union recovery rates from 2022 onwards will be subject to review and a public consultation to guide strategy once 50% recovery rates have been achieved.

Government budgetary policy is formulated based on what is right for the economy given our position in the economic cycle, not by a narrow, literal interpretation of what is permissible under the fiscal rules.<\/p><p>Table A1 of the Summer Economic Statement 2019 sets out an itemised 'walk' from the gross fiscal space permitted within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the European fiscal rules to net fiscal space. <\/p><p>This difference between gross and net fiscal space takes account of the measures that have already been provided for within the fiscal projections. The residual - net fiscal space - represents an additional amount on top of the existing budgetary increases that a literal application of the fiscal rules would allow. Using net fiscal space therefore worsens the headline general government balance.<\/p><p>The breakdown of pre-committed voted expenditure is shown in block <i>j<\/i>. The table details amounts that have been budgeted for in relation to demographics, the Public Service Stability Agreement and the carryover of Budget 2019 measures. As these all relate to current expenditure measures the nominal and fiscal space cost is the same. <\/p><p>However, as this table relates to fiscal space the amount shown for voted capital expenditure represents the smoothing over a four-year period in accordance with European fiscal rules. The corresponding nominal increase for 2020 is &euro;0.7 billion, as noted elsewhere in the Summer Economic Statement.<\/p><p>Row <i>k<\/i>delineates the movement related to &lsquo;other expenditure&rsquo;. As the assessment of fiscal space under the expenditure benchmark is carried out within the statistical framework of the European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010, this block of data also includes non-voted expenditure movements within the wider general government expenditure aggregate (subject to a number of technical adjustments). <\/p><p>Also shown are the expenditure increases budgeted for, but not committed to any measure, as well as the assumed tax reductions within the fiscal projections. The final row in this block is a residual between the corrected expenditure aggregate movement and all of the items detailed thus far.

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to motorists, including young motorists.<\/p><p>I understand that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used, the claims record, and the number of drivers.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market.  In addition, insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  I acknowledge the point that it would be helpful if insurers provided appropriately anonymised actuarial data to support their case with regard to pricing policy for younger motorists, however insurers argue that such information is commercially sensitive and unfortunately I am not in a position to compel them to disclose such information.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the Cost of Insurance Working Group was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and as part of that exercise, there was and has been extensive interaction with the insurance industry and its representative bodies.  The <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance<\/i>was published in January 201 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  In January 2018, the Working Group published the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  <\/i>This Report makes a further 15 Recommendations with 29 associated actions.  While this Report is focussed on addressing issues linked to business insurance, the implementation of recommendations from both reports will have a positive impact for all consumers and businesses including young motorists.  <\/p><p>There has been significant work to date in implementing the recommendations of the two aforementioned reports, including the following:<\/p><p>- the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;<\/p><p>- the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance;<\/p><p>- reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019<\/i>;<\/p><p>- amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,<\/p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee<\/i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.  <\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  <\/p><p>Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a further sustainable reduction in insurance costs for motorists is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  In this regard, relevant amendments were agreed to the Judicial Council Bill at Report Stage in the Seanad two weeks ago and I am pleased that the Bill subsequently completed its consideration by the Seanad.  This is a significant step and both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy are hopeful that the Bill can now complete its consideration by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and be enacted before the summer recess.<\/p><p>Finally, I would advise younger drivers who are quoted increased premiums to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website (), which has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.  One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.  Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

Following its review of feedback received, in accordance with statutory requirements, the Central Bank will be undertaking consultations with myself, the Credit Union Advisory Committee and credit union representative bodies on proposed draft regulations. Following this the Central Bank expects to publish a feedback statement and final regulations in the latter half of 2019. <\/p><p>In terms of savings, the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations) set an individual savings limit of &euro;100,000 that applies on a per member basis. The 2016 Regulations also provided that credit unions could apply to the Central Bank to retain individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations and that credit unions with total assets in excess of &euro;100 million can apply to the Central Bank for approval to increase individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000. <\/p><p>The introduction of the savings limit by the Central Bank followed a public consultation, CP88 - <i>Consultation on Regulations for Credit Unions on commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act<\/i>.  In the feedback statement to CP88, the Central Bank outlined that having considered the feedback received the Central Bank was of the view that an individual members savings limit of &euro;100,000 is appropriate given the stage of development of the sector and the Central Bank&rsquo;s mandate to ensure the protection of members&rsquo; funds by credit unions and safeguarding the stability of the sector.<\/p><p>The Deputy might also be interested to note that I will be bringing forward the Credit Union Interest on Loans Bill 2019 shortly. This bill will amend the current one per cent per month interest rate ceiling for credit unions, permitting credit unions to charge up to two per cent per month. This amendment will provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and in so doing may create an opportunity for credit unions to provide new product offerings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200063#WRF05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200063#WRF05100"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[27697\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200063#WRF05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of reducing a tax by percentage points (details supplied);

The payment service user must make this notification without undue delay, and no later than 13 months after the debit date.

In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department recently carried out a public consultation process on tax incentives aimed at the SME sector across a number of tax heads.  The EII schemes were included in that process. <\/p><p>With respect to the debt vs. equity nature and form of the investment, the Indecon report suggested that all shares would be new ordinary shares.  However, consideration was given to the fact that investors would not necessarily want these new ordinary shares and would therefore not invest.  As such, I decided that other forms of share capital could be allowable under the scheme.  The scheme was amended to allow redeemable, cumulative, preference share capital, provided that, it is not possible to amend the terms of those shares, for example, through side agreements that would otherwise reduce the risk. <\/p><p>Finally Revenue has also advised me that it is not possible to identify the number of additional jobs created by the EII from 2012 to 2017.

These projections also formed the basis for the Summer Economic Statement. The 2018 outturn figures reflect the expenditure incurred in respect of the Social Protection Christmas Bonus for 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Payment in respect of a Christmas Bonus commenced again in 2014, initially at a rate of 25%. The percentage rate has increased each year since 2014 and reached 100% in 2018. In line with the practice that such payments are funded based on the fiscal position for the year, in each of the years 2014 to 2019, the Revised Estimates Volume did not include a specific allocation in respect of a Social Welfare Christmas Bonus. This reflects the fact that the decision on paying a bonus, including the rate of that bonus, takes into account the overall fiscal position each year. Given that the decision to pay a Christmas Bonus this year relates to 2019 expenditure, it would not impact on the unallocated resources of &euro;700 million available for 2020 outlined in the Summer Economic Statement.<\/p>  <p>  The Christmas Bonus is paid both from funds voted by the D&aacute;il and from the Social Insurance Fund.

The challenges identified included matters relating to teacher allocation, the curriculum, recruitment of staff, travel and independent and DEIS status for island schools. <\/p><p>As a result of its deliberations, including meetings with representatives from Galway\/Roscommon ETB and Donegal ETB, under whose auspices the five post-primary schools located on the islands operate, the working group recommended the provision of an additional package of supports for island post-primary schools from September 2018<b>.<\/b><\/p><p>This ring-fenced package of supports for island post-primary schools, which is additional to the supports which are being provided under the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme in which all of the 5 island post-primary schools are participating, is set out in the following table.<\/p><p>In relation to the recruitment of teachers by island schools, as part of the overall implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022, my Department has made arrangements and provided funding for the commencement of two new Irish medium teacher education programmes to increase the supply of teachers who can deliver high quality Irish-medium education. These programmes include a 2 year part-time Irish-medium M.Ed. in Irish-medium and Gaeltacht Education, which commenced in Mary Immaculate College in September 2018 and a 4 year full-time B.Ed Irish-medium initial teacher education programme, which will commence in Marino Institute of Education from September 2019. Funding is being provided for 30 new places per annum on each of the two new programmes. In addition, provision has been made for the secondment of two teaching posts to the Irish-medium Professional Masters in Education at NUIG to work towards increasing the number of teachers who can teach a range of subjects through the medium of Irish.<\/p><p>Another initiative, which is being implemented under the Policy on Gaeltacht Education is the e-hub pilot project, which aims to utilise online delivery to extend the subject range available through the medium of Irish to students in isolated post-primary Gaeltacht schools, commencing with Higher Level Leaving Certificate Physics.  3 of the 5 island post-primary schools will be participating in the pilot project commencing from September 2019. This will enable students in these schools to undertake the Higher Level Leaving Certificate Physics examination in 2021.<\/p><p>In relation to the assignation of DEIS status to island schools, such schools are assessed on the same basis as all other schools in the country for the purposes of inclusion in the programme<i>. <\/i>This assessment is based on data in the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie\/en\/Schools-Colleges\/Services\/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-\/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This is turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.<\/p><p>My Department is currently undertaking data analysis in the context of resource allocation to match identified need, including the examination of variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage.  All schools, including Island Schools, are being considered using the new identification model. Until this analysis is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200066#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200066#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[27605\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200066#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the full salary of a person (details supplied) will be backdated to pre-2011 pay scales.","asker":"1248","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>Salary scales for teachers are based on the date of their first qualified appointment to an Oireachtas funded post as follows:<\/p><p>A person first appointed to an Oireachtas funded teaching post between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012, whose date of first qualified Oireachtas funded teaching service is&ndash;<\/p><p>-  before 5 December 2011, is paid on the 1 January 2011 qualified pay scale and the qualification allowances applicable to that scale,<\/p><p>-  between 5 December 2011 and 28 April 2013, is paid on the 1 January 2011 pay scale and qualification allowances applicable to that scale subject to the maximum value of the honours primary degree allowance applicable to that scale, or<\/p><p>-  on or after 29 April 2013, is paid on the 1 February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.<\/p><p>A person first appointed to an Oireachtas funded teaching post on or after 1 February 2012 whose date of first qualified Oireachtas funded teaching service is on or after that date will be paid on the 1 February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.<\/p><p>The records available within my Department show that the teacher in question had his first Oireachtas funded appointment on 14th October 2010 as an unqualified substitute teacher.

The use of digital technologies, allows teachers to unlock and deepen learning across all areas including literacy, numeracy, languages, arts education and STEM. Students will be able to recognise the benefits of the online interconnected world as an important source of information to create knowledge and problem solve and not just see the internet as a source of information to be &ldquo;consumed&rdquo;.

The important focus, as provided for in the Digital Strategy, must be for digital technologies to add value to the learning process as part of a suite of tools in the classroom, such as books and whiteboards, alongside more modern learning devices, to enhance teaching and learning. It was for this reason that the Digital Learning Framework was developed together with the extensive range of CPD programmes for teachers and schools on the effective use of digital technologies in the classroom\/schools. The Framework provides a roadmap to help schools embed the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning and in leadership &amp;amp; management. The Framework promotes student engagement in the teaching and learning process whereby students become engaged thinkers, active and discerning learners and where digital interactions are respectful and positive and conductive to well-being. <\/p>  <p>   In the context of the DLF, schools are supported to develop a Digital Learning Plan, and have flexibility to determine how best to embed the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning in their school, taking into account their individual circumstances and contexts.  The DLF supports and complements the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process and will allow schools to evaluate their own progress and measure where they stand against benchmarks of effective and highly effective practices in the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning and leadership and management. The Framework does not provide for comparison of academic performances. <\/p>  <p>  The Framework is in its second year of dissemination and is accompanied by an extensive CPD framework for teachers and schools.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also commissioned the ERC to conduct a more longitudinal study of the DLF of a three year duration.

The list of supports is available at <i>www.education.ie\/en\/Publications\/Policy-Reports\/DEIS-Plan-2017.pdf<\/i>. <\/p><p>In relation to the criteria for determining whether a school should be included in the DEIS programme, when DEIS was first introduced in 2006, the identification of schools for inclusion was based on two different processes at primary and post primary.  At primary level, there was a survey of school principals using the following socio-economic variables: %unemployment; %local authority accommodation; %lone parenthood; %travellers; %large families (more than 5 children); %pupils eligible for free books.  At post primary level a combination of data from the Departments pupil database including school level retention rates together with exam achievement data and exam fee waiver data, which indicated that students had medical cards, was used.<\/p><p>Following a review of DEIS in 2016 and an extensive consultation process, a new identification process was developed for assessing schools levels of concentrated disadvantage. The key data sources used in the new DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Haase Pratschke Deprivation Index  (HP Index).  The HP Index combines three underlying dimensions of affluence\/disadvantage, identified as Demographic Profile, Social Class Composition and Labour Market Situation, to achieve a balanced measure of relative affluence and deprivation, which evenly applies across the urban-rural continuum.Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, single parent rates, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school using the HP index is therefore based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data and is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides.<\/p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>w<\/i><i>ww.education.ie\/en\/Schools-Colleges\/Services\/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-\/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf<\/i><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Following an initial application of this new methodology, 79 new schools were brought into the DEIS programme in 2017 with a further 30 being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.

I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 57 were assigned to the Tipperary \u00a0Division.\u00a0This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide significant additional policing hours throughout the country, both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties due to civilianisation of their current roles.

These include the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, Freedom of Information Act 2014 and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to recent legislative developments, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 was commenced in full on the 30 July 2018. The Act repealed and replaced the seven previous Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010. The Act is not merely a consolidation of the old provisions. It strengthens and clarifies the law in relation to corruption. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also a party to a number of anti-corruption international instruments.  These are the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).  As such, Ireland is subject to regular peer evaluations associated with the implementation of these international agreements with recommendations for improvement made following each review.  <\/p>  <p>  Mr James Hamilton, the anti-corruption expert and former Director of Public Prosecutions, is chairing an interdepartmental and multi-agency Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption structures.

The Foothold Floating Support Service provides one to one support for men leaving custody convicted of a sexual offence. The Circles of Support and Accountability (CoSA) provides support to the offender by providing an inner circle of support, usually volunteers from the community, who are in turn surrounded by a professional circle and community. <\/p><p>While Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual or gender based violence, and is providing &euro;25.3 million for these services in 2019, my Department provides funding through its Victims of Crime Office to promote and assist the development of support services to victims of crime.  Such services continue to provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews, accompaniment to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services. In this regard, the Victims of Crime Office has allocated a total of &euro;12.5 million since 2011, to provide funding support to victim support services. In addition, Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, has provided funding of &euro;380,000 since 2011 to the Rape Crisis Network Ireland's legal coordination service. <\/p><p>Details of the funding amounts made available for the period in question are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Victims of Crime Funding <\/th><th>Cosc Funding <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2019 <\/td><td>&euro;1.712m <\/td><td>&euro;50,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018 <\/td><td>&euro;1.712m <\/td><td>&euro;40,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017 <\/td><td>&euro;1.712m <\/td><td>&euro;40,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 <\/td><td>&euro;1.462m <\/td><td>&euro;40,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015 <\/td><td>&euro;1.212m <\/td><td>&euro;40,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 <\/td><td>&euro;1.212m <\/td><td>&euro;40,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 <\/td><td>&euro;1.196m <\/td><td>&euro;40,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012 <\/td><td>&euro;1.141m <\/td><td>&euro;45,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011 <\/td><td>&euro;1.205m <\/td><td>&euro;45,000 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In relation to the investigation of such crimes, as the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Increased reporting by victims of sexual offences to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may also be interpreted as an increase in confidence of victims to report.

A Family Court Bill will be introduced to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures. These courts will have new procedures aimed at less adversarial resolution of disputes and will have appropriate facilities and case management arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  A working group was established in 2017, comprising officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board, to examine the operational aspects relating to the family court and develop an overall architecture for the new family court structure. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla also participated in the working group. Key issues that arose in consultations included family court venues and facilities, resources and capital investment in family courts and integration of relevant family and child services to provide the best possible family law outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, a task force on the Family Court comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service was formed to seek agreement on core questions of policy and costs.  A representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has also joined the group. The work of this group is at an advanced stage. Issues being examined include court areas and locations, use of courthouses, provision of facilities and services, arrangements for management of resources, and oversight arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Work is well advanced on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill. When finalised, the General Scheme will be submitted for Government approval in the usual manner and will have to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill will then be drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It is not possible at this stage to estimate when the Bill will be ready for publication. <\/p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill is only one component of a new Family Court system. The provision of appropriate court facilities and services, and the capital and current resources that may be required for this, will be just as important, if not more so, for the operation of a new family court system. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to building a new Family Law Centre and Children&rsquo;s Court in Dublin 7.

It also includes a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical, or partly electrical and partly mechanical. Whether or not a vehicle requires a push-start is legally irrelevant.<br \/><br \/>E-scooters and powered skateboards fall into this category, and are therefore considered to be mechanically propelled vehicles. Any users of such vehicles in a public place (as defined in the Road Traffic Act 1961) must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, with penalties under road traffic laws (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) for not being in compliance with these requirements  .<br \/><br \/>As it is currently not possible to tax or insure e-scooters or electric skateboards, they are not considered suitable for use in a public place.

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort Model of resource allocation is currently used for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College. Using this model, the allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, and operational strategies. When considering the allocation of resources to a Division, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration.<\/p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.\u00a0 To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that while not all Garda Stations are training stations it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 118 were assigned to the Kildare Garda Division. This year to date, two intakes of probationer Garda&iacute; have attested and been allocated on the 8 March, and the 10 June respectively. Six newly attested Garda&iacute; were allocated to the Kildare Division in March 2019: two to Kildare Garda Station, two to Leixlip Garda Station and two to Naas Garda Station. The allocation of resources within the Division is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer. <\/p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year.

The 2018 Act transposed in large part the Fourth EU Anti Money Laundering Directive and also brought Irish law into line with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, an international standard-setting body.<\/p>  <p>  The main change brought about by the 2018 Act was the introduction of new requirements around a risk-based approach. This means, first of all, that the businesses concerned (which the legislation calls designated persons), must assess the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing involved in carrying out their business. They must have policies and procedures in place to mitigate these risks. They must determine the risk attaching to each customer or transaction, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account relevant factors. And they must then carry out whatever due diligence measures are warranted by that level of risk. This represents a more targeted and therefore more effective application of measures by the designated person.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 Act also recognises the reality that many businesses today operate in group structures across borders. It made a number of amendments to the 2010 Act in this regard.  The Act expanded the requirements on Irish companies to ensure that their subsidiaries overseas apply high anti-money laundering standards. If a group implements policies and procedures properly, its subsidiaries are not subject to some restrictions that normally apply in respect of high-risk third countries.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 Act also extended the scope of existing obligations in other ways. For example, some measures which previously only applied to banks, now apply to other financial institutions. There are extra measures that must be applied to the beneficiaries of life assurance policies. Measures applying to politically exposed persons will now apply to those resident in Ireland as well as those resident abroad.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, of great importance in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is the role of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The FIU in Ireland is part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is responsible for receiving suspicious transaction reports from designated persons and analysing them, so that it can be used to combat crime. The 2018 Act expands the remit of the FIU. It requires them to have access to all of the information they need to carry out their functions and allows for cooperation and information sharing between the FIU in Ireland and the FIUs of other Member States. <\/p>  <p>  The 2018 Act also introduced a fitness and probity regime for the owners of private members&rsquo; gaming clubs. This change, which transposes a provision of the Fourth Directive, requires both those who hold a directorial function, as well as the beneficial owners of such clubs, to apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Minister for Justice for a certificate of fitness. It is now a criminal offence to carry on such activities without that certificate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the changes above, the Government also approved the drafting of a further Bill to amend the 2010 Act in January of this year, provisionally titled the Criminal Justice (Money, Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2019. The General Scheme for this Bill was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in January and its aim is to give effect to the criminal justice elements of the Fifth EU Anti Money Laundering Directive.<\/p>  <p>  While drafting work is ongoing, the General Scheme, as published, will amend some provisions of the 2010 Act, and insert others, concerned with:<\/p>  <p>  - the use of virtual currencies for terrorist financing and limiting the use of pre-paid cards;<\/p>  <p>  - safeguards for financial transactions to and from high-risk third countries;<\/p>  <p>  - the scope of designated bodies under the existing legislation;<\/p>  <p>  - enhanced customer due diligence (CDD) requirements;<\/p>  <p>  - the prevention of credit and financial institutions from creating anonymous safe-deposit boxes;<\/p>  <p>  - a Regulation-making power for the Minister which will set out what is considered to be a &ldquo;prominent public function&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  - a number of technical amendments.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the &lsquo;money laundering legislation&rsquo; above, the Deputy may also wish to note that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has introduced, and will introduce further, legislation to deal with those elements of the Money Laundering Directives that fall within his policy remit. This includes the establishment of beneficial ownership registers and centralised bank account registers, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200070#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Building Programme","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200070#WRN01700"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[28094\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200070#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the length of time the construction of a new female prison in Limerick and a new wing at Limerick male prison will take to complete; if both construction projects have commenced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that a contract has been awarded for a substantial development at Limerick Prison, which comprises the construction of a new wing for male prisoners, a stand-alone unit for female prisoners, staff facilities, a new kitchen, a new visits and reception area, a laundry, and training and recreation facilities.

However, the processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.

Ireland&rsquo;s main exports to Vietnam include medical and pharmaceutical products valued at &euro;18.6m in 2018.  Ireland's food exports to Vietnam have grown considerably in recent years.  While meat and dairy products are the largest share of this, beverages and seafood also contributed strongly.  In 2017 (the most recent year with available figures), services exports from Ireland to Vietnam were valued at &euro;164m.  Services imports from Vietnam for the same year totalled &euro;13m.  Last year, Ireland imported &euro;167m worth of goods from Vietnam which mainly consisted of clothing, footwear and furniture.  <\/p><p>Through the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;<i>Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World<\/i>&rsquo;, we aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland 2025 strategy, Enterprise Ireland will open a new office in Ho Chi Minh City this year to support Irish businesses to expand into the Vietnamese market and to take advantage of the new opportunities presented by the FTA. <\/p><p>Negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and Vietnam were concluded in December 2015.  On 31 June 2019 the EU and Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement along with the EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (IPA).  The FTA will unlock a market with huge potential for Irish and EU firms and includes the elimination of nearly all tariffs (over 99%) on EU exports to Vietnam.  65% of these tariffs will be liberalised at entry into force of the FTA with the remainder phased out over a 10-year period.  The FTA also covers non-tariff barriers to trade and other trade related issues such as public procurement, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, regulatory issues, and sustainable development.  I support the entry into force of the EU-Vietnam FTA so that Irish firms may benefit from the new business opportunities provided for by the Agreement. <\/p><p>Opportunities exist for Ireland to grow exports in dairy products, pork, seafood and alcoholic beverages by taking advantage of reduced tariffs under the FTA.  Currently tariffs on EU exports of spirits to Vietnam are particularly high at 48% and will eliminated over a 7-year period following entry into force of the FTA.  The elimination of tariffs of 15% on frozen pork products is also significant for Irish producers. <\/p><p>Ireland is an exceptionally open economy and is dependent on international trade and investment as sources of growth.  Building new export opportunities for our businesses forms a vital part of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy.  We favour ambitious and balanced trade agreements, negotiated by the EU Commission on our behalf, which are designed to deliver jobs and growth for the benefit of our citizens.  The EU-Vietnam FTA and the EU&rsquo;s other trade agreements help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  <\/p><p>As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world, including Vietnam, were organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests.  <\/p><p>In a wider context, Vietnam is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).

However, the money that is paid in as share capital is not required to be kept separate but is mingled with the other funds of the company and\/or used by it. Thus, even if minimum thresholds of share capital were to be required, there would still not be a readily available cash fund equivalent to the share capital from which to cover creditors&rsquo; claims against the company in an insolvency situation. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a requirement to set share capital and reserves as a proportion of turnover could represent a significant obstacle to the conduct of commerce through company structures and have unintended consequences. If a minimum level were set and a company breached that minimum it could result in the loss of limited liability and force viable companies into liquidation with adverse consequences for employment in such companies.  Further, if a company had a poor trading year, the amount of proportionate reserves required would fall in monetary terms as turnover may be reduced but a company&rsquo;s debts could increase nonetheless. <\/p>  <p>  Limited liability is one of the principal reasons why most businesses decide to incorporate in the first place. The availability of limited liability facilitates entrepreneurship and job creation by allowing entrepreneurs to trade without compromising personal assets. However, the availability of limited liability is a privilege not a right and is subject to safeguards to protect the interests of other stakeholders. The Companies Act 2014 contains provisions in which the separate legal personality of the company may be pierced in certain circumstances to visit liability on persons concerned in the carrying on of the business e.g.:<\/p>  <p>  Section 610 - Civil liability for fraudulent and reckless trading  <\/p>  <p>  Section 612 - Misfeasance <\/p>  <p>  Section 722 - Fraudulent Trading.<\/p>  <p>  Section 599 and 600 contain further safeguards as they provide respectively that in certain circumstances a related company may be required to contribute to the debts of a company being wound up, and for the pooling of assets of related companies.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that minimum share capital requirements are stringent in respect of their application to companies which have a director who has been restricted. Section 819(3) of the Companies Act 2014 requires that any company which has a director who is subject to a restriction order must have an allotted share capital of nominal value not less than &euro;500,000 in the case of a public limited company (other than an investment company) or a public unlimited company, and &euro;100,000 in the case of any other company type. These requirements can be difficult to meet. However, perhaps more importantly, the fact that a director is subject to a restriction order can make it much more difficult for a company to obtain credit and as a result, the threat of restriction acts as a powerful disincentive.

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The HSE issues income guidelines to assist in determining entitlement to medical and GP visit cards. Any revision to the income thresholds must have regard for Government policy, increases in the Consumer Price Index and other issues which may be relevant.   While there are no plans at present to revise the income thresholds for medical cards, it is vitally important that the medical card system is responsive and considerate to people's needs and circumstances. In that regard my Department keeps medical card issues, including existing thresholds under constant review. Any new policy measures regarding income thresholds for either medical cards or GP visit cards to be incorporated into the forthcoming Budget will be considered by Government as part of the 2020 Estimates process. <\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to improve access to free GP care and other health services. Since July 2015, all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.  This card is valid for a period of 5 years. Since July 2017, all children under the age of 16 for whom a Domiciliary Care Allowance is paid also has automatic eligibility for a medical card. <\/p>  <p>  Children aged under 6 years and individuals over 70 and those in receipt of a Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit are now automatically eligible for a GP visit card. Most recently in April of this year, a 10% increase was applied across all GP Visit Card income thresholds enabling more people to access free GP care. <\/p>  <p>  In context of the above, it is important to note that approximately 42.8% of the population now have access to free GP care. In addition, if a person's sole income is derived from a social welfare payment, even where this payment is in excess of the current income thresholds, the person will be awarded a medical card. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Services","counter":981,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":982,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[27571\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the establishment of assistant psychologists; the details of assistant psychologists and the location of the posting of each as of 23 June 2019, in tabular form; the key performance indicators for assistant psychologists; his plans to retain the persons employed in the posts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":983,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":984,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":985,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[27576\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) who has been urgently referred to an orthopaedic consultant will be issued with an appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":986,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

However cervical screening will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer. In the cases of 1,482 women who had been screened and were later given a diagnosis of cervical cancer, CervicalCheck carried out an audit of their previous cervical screening tests. The objective of audit and quality review at CervicalCheck was to facilitate continued improvement and ongoing learning within the programme. The audit found that 221 of these women could have been provided with a different result. <\/p>  <p>  In August 2015, a decision was taken by the HSE, in line with international best practice, to provide information on the outcome of the audit for onward communication to patients but the intention to disclose this information was not followed through and many of the women concerned were not informed about the results of the audit.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to an appropriate form of apology, and this will be discussed with the 221+ before any final decision is made. I have met and spoken with many of the women involved, including at a meeting in January 2019, at which I apologised for how women and families were treated, as well as thanking them for sharing their views and experiences. The National Cancer Screening Service wrote last year to each woman affected, or their next of kin, apologising for the failures in relation to disclosure and setting out the actions being taken by the HSE to address the issues identified. The former Director General of the HSE, and the former head of Cervical Check have also apologised personally to individual women when the opportunity has arisen. Last year, Cervical Check placed advertisements with national media outlets apologising for how standards fell short in relation to this issue. <\/p>  <p>  It is also very important to note the actions taken by the State to address the issues identified in the Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Scally. Government has accepted in full the recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry and work is ongoing to implement these in full. In relation to the women concerned I am pleased that the Ex-Gratia Scheme has made its first payments in relation to the non-disclosure of audit results, and I understand that the panel will meet again shortly to consider further payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1015,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[27599\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the State is appealing the recent High Court ruling in respect of a case (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1016,"content":"<p>The State Claims Agency (SCA) has a statutory remit to manage personal injury claims, including claims in respect of clinical negligence, on behalf of Delegated State Authorities (DSA&rsquo;s) including the Health Service Executive. <\/p>  <p>  The particular case is being managed by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The High Court found that the HSE was entitled to an indemnity from the two laboratories in respect of the Court&rsquo;s finding that their examination of the two smear test results had been negligent .

Many areas in our health service currently lack sufficient capacity to meet the ever-increasing demand for services and the needs of patients, resulting in unacceptably long waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for scheduled care in acute hospitals. The joint Department of Health\/HSE\/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient\/day case treatment and outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  The Access Plan sets out the activity levels for the NTPF, who will supply additionality to HSE activity, in order to reduce waiting times experienced by patients for a hospital appointment, operation or procedure.  <\/p>  <p>  The Access Plan ensures an appropriate balance between high volume activities and offering treatment to complex long waiting patients. The NTPF is working with public hospitals to seek NTPF-funded solutions for very long waiting patients, either in the private sector or in public hospitals where there is available capacity. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the Galway University Hospital chronic pain service is a tertiary referral service and is delivered across both University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park University Hospital. The service consists of 6 clinics per month, where new and review patients are seen, and patients may also have trigger point injections performed at these clinics. All appointments are followed up by the Registered Advanced Nurse Practitioner (RANP) to avoid routine review clinic appointments.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are 2 interventional pain management sessions carried out in the Surgical Day ward per week (8 per month).  One session (6 patients) is radiology guided procedures and 1 session (6 patients) is non-radiology guided. This list consists of 12 patients per week and in-patients may also be added.<\/p>  <p>  There are also scheduled interventional pain lists (6 per month) in Merlin Park.  Four sessions are radiology guided and 2 sessions are non-radiology guided. These lists consist of 6 patients per session. In total 14 intervention sessions a month are carried out between UHG and MP.<\/p>  <p>  The Registered Advanced Nurse Practitioner offers a telephone follow up service for all patients following intervention to avoid repeat Outpatient Department appointments for routine follow ups.  A number of in-patients are reviewed on a consultation basis also. The pain clinic has the support of 6 psychology sessions a month. Group sessions are conducted 3 times a year.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE advise that all patients are called in order of clinical priority and\/or in chronological order and additional clinics to support the waiting lists are currently being discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200072#WRP07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":1045,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200073#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1046,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[27670\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200073#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE has completed a review on the cost effectiveness of providing FreeStyle Libre sensors to assist persons in managing diabetes; his plans to provide this technology in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1275","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1047,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200073#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Accommodation Provision","counter":1048,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200073#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1049,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[27680\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200073#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the emergency department at Mayo University Hospital will be extended and capacity increased.

It can also enter the food chain as an environmental contaminant in water, due to its use in intensive farming methods, livestock production and sewage discharge.  In humans, nitrite and nitrate from food are rapidly absorbed by the body and, for the most part, excreted as nitrate.  Some of the nitrate absorbed by the body is converted in the body into nitrite, the absorption of which can lead, in excessive quantities, to a reduced ability of red blood cells to bind and transport oxygen through the body.  Nitrite in food (<i>and nitrate converted to nitrite in the body<\/i>) may also contribute to the formation of a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are carcinogenic.<\/p><p>For decades the salts of nitrate and nitrite have been added to food to preserve it and they also help hinder the growth of harmful microorganisms.  The use of additives in food is strictly controlled by EU legislation.  They must undergo a comprehensive scientific safety assessment before being authorised for use in the manufacture or preparation of foodstuffs.  The natural occurrence of nitrate in foods such as vegetables is regulated by maximum levels set out in EU Regulation 1881\/2006 as amended.  <\/p><p>The FSAI has indicated that the safety of nitrate has been comprehensively evaluated by European Union (EU) and International Scientific Experts, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.<\/p><p>In a re-evaluation on the safety of nitrate, EFSA concluded in 2017 that the exposure to nitrate resulting from its use as a food additive did not lead to an exceedance of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and was estimated to be less than 5% of the overall exposure to nitrate in food from all dietary sources.  However, EFSA noted that total dietary exposure to nitrate from all sources (food additives, natural presence and contamination) exceeded the current ADI in all European populations considered.  Similar conclusions were drawn concerning dietary exposure to nitrites from all sources.<\/p><p>An assessment carried out by EFSA in 2008 on nitrates present in food as contaminants compared the risk and benefits of exposure to nitrate from vegetables and concluded that the beneficial effects outweighed potential health risks from exposure to nitrate through vegetables, and that the average European consumer would not exceed the ADI.  <\/p><p>In 2010, a further opinion was delivered on the potential health risks for infants and young children from naturally occurring nitrate in leafy vegetables, which concluded that levels of nitrate in these vegetables do not pose a health concern for most children.<\/p><p>As previously noted, nitrites, including when used as food additives, contribute to the formation of nitrosamines.  Applying some worst-case scenario assumptions, EFSA concluded that the formation of nitrosamines in the body from use of food additives at approved levels was of low concern for human health.  However, EFSA further noted that nitrite unintentionally present in meat products from other sources such as environmental contamination can also contribute to the formation of nitrosamines. EFSA concluded that these levels of nitrosamines might give rise to potential health concerns but that more research was needed to address uncertainties and knowledge gaps that may exist in this area.<\/p><p>According to the most recent Irish Total Diet study performed by the FSAI between 2012 to 2014, exposure estimates to both nitrite and nitrate in adults and children resident in Ireland were found to be below the respective health-based guidance values.  The study identified vegetables as the most important dietary contributor for nitrate, and ham as the only dietary contributor for nitrite.

This was down from 2,711 in April 2018. The HSE has prioritised reducing both short- and long-term CAMHS waiting lists. This has helped to reduce the waiting lists of those waiting over 12 months, which has reduced from 352 in April 2018 to 316 in April this year.  In April 2019 approximately 80% of young people were offered a first appointment within 12 weeks in community CAMHS settings <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the number of referrals to CAMHS increased from around 12,800 referrals received in 2011 to around 18,100 referrals expected in 2019. Cases assessed by professionals as urgent are seen as a matter of priority.  <\/p>  <p>  The recent Budget provided an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health which brings overall HSE mental health funding to nearly &euro;1 billion in 2019. This funding has helped to increase services available in this area.<\/p>  <p>  There are now 70 CAMHS teams, compared to 49 in 2008, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams. All aspects of CAMHS nationally are being improved by the HSE under its annual Service Plans. This includes better out-of-hours and 7\/7 day cover, progression of Day Hospital care, developing specialist teams such as Eating Disorders, and improved Prevention and Early Intervention services.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, we have also tried to reduce demand on CAMHS. The HSE funds Jigsaw to provide early intervention mental health services which focus on the needs of 12-25 year olds. Their early intervention model provides tangible supports for young people at primary care level who have mild and emerging mental health difficulties. There are currently 13 Jigsaw Services in communities across Ireland providing mental health support to young people with 2 more sites in Wicklow and Tipperary expected to be opened in the next year .<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE, I am progressing various initiatives to enhance CAMHS, and also to adopt a wider approach around Prevention and Early Intervention measures, designed to alleviate pressures on the specialist CAMHS service. These include maximising the impact of the additional Primary Care Assistant Psychologists recruited in 2018 to relieve pressures on CAMHS; roll-out by the HSE of various e-mental health pilot projects; and additional Psychiatric Nurse training places coming on-stream to help fill existing vacancies.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to monitor CAMHS activity and staffing data.  In addition, I have held meetings with, and sought further information from, the Chief Officers and Executive Clinical Directors of the CHOs specifically on CAMHS vacancies, with a view to improving the rate of recruitment for CAMHS staff. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200074#WRR07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200075#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[27998\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200075#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive an appointment with a respiratory consultant at University Hospital Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1184,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Commission found that evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications was indicative of on-going difficulties in regard to recruitment of consultants.  Research undertaken on its behalf identified a number of relevant factors including relative pay, training opportunities and the lack of attractiveness of specific posts, particularly in smaller hospitals.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission acknowledged that the difference in pay between the pre-existing and new entrant consultants is greater than for other categories of public servants.  It did not view the measures announced last September for new entrant public servants generally, as being sufficient to address the degree of pay differential which exists for Consultants. Given its analysis, the Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential. <\/p>  <p>  The Government accepted the Report of the Commission and recognises that there are significant recruitment and retention challenges in relation to consultant posts. The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed. The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of medical consultants.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that while pay has an impact in recruitment and retention of consultants, a number of other factors are also important, including, inter alia, opportunities for career development, training opportunities and location. The Commission stated it was strongly supportive of the full implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structures, the 'MacCraith' recommendations, as they have the potential to resolve many of the issues raised with the Commission relating to recruitment and retention.

The issue has also been examined by the Public Sector Pay Commission in relation to consultants. Given its analysis, the Commission proposed that the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken over time to address the pay differential. The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed. The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of consultants. However, brokering an affordable solution will be a significant challenge, in particular within the context of budgetary pressures and broader public sector policy.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that while pay has an impact in recruitment and retention of consultants, a number of other factors are also important, including, inter alia, opportunities for career development, training opportunities and location. The Commission stated it was strongly supportive of the full implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structures, the 'MacCraith' recommendations, on the basis they have the potential to resolve many of the issues raised with the Commission relating to recruitment and retention. My Department continues to monitor progress on implementation of these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Concerning Nurses, the recent nursing agreement and the new Enhanced Practice Nurse\/Midwife contract will see the financial position of nurses and midwives improve and should help to both recruit and retain nurses in the public health service.

The Enhanced Nurse \/ Midwife Practice salary scale ranges between &euro;35,806 to &euro;47,201. The agreement will see improvements to a range of allowances, their extension to additional nurses and midwives, and a new allowance for those in medical surgical wards up to the maximum full year cost of &euro;10m.

Reducing agricultural emissions;<\/p><p>2. Increasing carbon sequestration; and<\/p><p>3.

These actions include both efficiency measures such as the Dairy EBI programme and technical measures such as changes in fertiliser type or low emissions slurry spreading as well as a series of forestry and bio economy measures.<\/p><p>Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) are very beneficial in terms of identifying the most cost-effective ways of meeting the targets both within and between sectors and also in identifying options that cost less than the marginal benefit from abatement. MACCs provide a useful framework to engage stakeholders on opportunities to reduce emissions. <\/p><p>While the target for the agriculture sector in the All-of-Government Plan to tackle climate breakdown is challenging, immediate action and early adoption is key and there are three important actions that can be advanced immediately.<\/p><p>- Deepening engagement with farmers and other stakeholders to promote the necessary deployment of new technologies and changes in farming practices. <\/p><p>- Improving nitrogen use efficiency such as widespread adoption of low emissions slurry spreading or introduction of clover in grassland swards; and<\/p><p>- Continuing our support for research and innovation such as the potential of novel feed additives in grass based production systems. <\/p><p>I will work to ensure that the next Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) is aligned with this ambition and that climate action is main streamed in the development of our CAP strategic plan to ensure the delivery of this target.

A young farmer is clearly defined as a person who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting their first Basic Payment Scheme application and who is no more than 40 years of age in the year of submission of such an application.  My Department has no discretion in the implementation of this aspect of EU Regulation 1307\/2013 and in this regard farmers who commenced their agricultural activity prior to 1 January 2010 are not eligible for the Young Farmers Scheme.<\/p><p>In respect of the Forgotten Farmer issue, the Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements at the national average level of approximately &euro;185 or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements to the national average value for persons who suffer from a specific disadvantage.<\/p><p>In the context of the discussions with the EU Commission in early 2015 regarding the inclusion of the group referred to as Old Young Farmers under the 2015 National Reserve, the Commission advised that the inclusion of groups under &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; category  of the National Reserve would require individual approval at EU level.<\/p><p>The National Reserve in 2017 was established using funding derived from a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements. EU Regulations pertaining to the National Reserve provide that the two categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; must receive priority access to the Reserve.  In the context of the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>, Ireland consulted with the EU Commission regarding the possibility of including the group commonly referred to as Forgotten Farmers under the specific disadvantage category of the 2017 National Reserve. The EU Commission confirmed that Member States could not use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund a specific disadvantage category of the National Reserve.  <\/p><p>The Commission confirmed at the time that the only funding option for the specific disadvantage category was natural replenishment of the Reserve, such as from unused entitlements or the proceeds of clawback, but only after the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; had been catered for.<\/p><p>EU Regulation 2393\/2017 (Omnibus Regulation) came into effect in January 2018 and introduced a new possibility for the inclusion of &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; categories such as Forgotten Farmers into the National Reserve. From 2018, Member States may use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; categories of the Reserve, but only if a linear cut is required to fund the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; in that particular year.  As there was sufficient funding available in the National Reserve in 2018 and 2019 from natural replenishment of the fund in order to cater for the two priority categories, the issue of a linear cut did not arise.<\/p><p>All entitlements held under the Basic Payment Scheme are subject to convergence.  Farmers who hold entitlements that have an Initial Unit Value that is below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average have seen the value of their entitlements increase gradually over the five years of the scheme.  By 2019, all entitlements for all farmers in Ireland are at least 60% of the national average value.  In this regard, the group of farmers referred to as Forgotten Farmers will have benefitted from an increase in the value of their entitlements through convergence to 2019.<\/p><p>Decisions in relation to the National Reserve, including the basis of funding the Reserve, are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which comprises members of the main farming organisations, farm advisory and education services.<\/p><p>With regard to eligibility for the Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme, I am aware that there is a group of young farmers who established their holdings prior to 2008.  A person in this category does not qualify under EU rules for the increased rate-of-aid of 60% available under the scheme.  However, where possible priority is given to these affected farmers within the general stream of applicants for TAMS II, with grant-aid payable at 40%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200078#WRV05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry Development","counter":1430,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200078#WRV05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1431,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[28092\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200078#WRV05700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an agricultural attach&eacute; will be allocated to the Irish embassies in Ottawa, New Delhi and Seoul; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1432,"content":"<p>My Department and its agencies have a considerable, and growing, global footprint which is primarily aimed at facilitating growth in our agri-food exports.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland 2025 initiative, and in keeping with my Department&rsquo;s efforts to help the agri-food sector to diversify its export markets, my Department is expanding its staffing in international locations over the period to 2025.

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the decision of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide.

The Broadcasting Act 2009 established the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as the independent regulator for linear broadcasting services, both television and radio in Ireland. On-demand services are currently subject to a co-regulatory Code of Conduct overseen by the On-Demand Audiovisual Services Group (ODAS), which was established under the auspices of IBEC.

As An Post is a commercial State body, this support was provided by way of a loan. <\/p>  <p>  The past financial challenges facing An Post have been well documented primarily due to the impact of email and other forms of online communication on mail volumes. Mail volumes have decreased some 40% since 2007. In 2018 alone mail volumes declined by 7.6%.

Cumulatively, the energy efficiency improvements achieved by public sector bodies have resulted in an avoided energy spend of more than &euro;1 billion and a carbon emissions saving of over 3.5 million tonnes. The achievements to date result from a combination of improved energy management as well as equipment and building fabric improvements. A combination of approaches will continue to be necessary in the future to meet our targets including targeted energy efficiency investment in the retrofitting of buildings. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is providing leadership and guidance to other Government departments and public sector bodies to help them to achieve their efficiency targets as part of the process of implementing the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy. This includes the SEAI engaging with Public Sector Bodies to assess the range and nature of project opportunities (project pipeline) including building fabric upgrades. This ongoing exercise will help to inform the assessment of the costs to achieve the targets for 2030 and beyond. It is also important to note that the achievement of public sector targets will require initiatives beyond those targeted at the building stock. This would include initiatives relating to public transport fleets, water and waste facilities, public lighting and other energy users across the public sector.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to avail of expertise under the EU Structural Reform Support Service (SRSS) to inform the development of a comprehensive building upgrade programme for the Public Sector.

AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school service. It offers tailored, practical supports based on need and does not require a formal diagnosis of disability.<\/p>  <p>  Level 7 of AIM provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used by the pre-school provider either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room (enabling the provider to reduce the number of children in the room without impacting on the provider's total income) or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting.<\/p>  <p>  The funding is disbursed to the pre-school provider, through Pobal, who are charged with administration of DCYA programmes.  There are restrictions on the use to which AIM funding can be put, as is only right and appropriate to guidelines on grant funding and use of public money.  Pre-school providers are awarded AIM Level 7 funding as a result of an assessment carried out by an Early Years Specialist, and guidance and support on how best to utilise the funding may be provided. However, as with all DCYA Early Learning and Care funding programmes, the pre-school provider is the employer of the staff who work in the setting. It is therefore for the pre-school provider to take all necessary steps to ensure they are meeting their legal obligations as an employer.<\/p>  <p>  First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, includes a commitment to review the funding model for the Early Learning and Care sector, under which employers will be supported to provide more favourable working conditions to attract and retain staff. The new funding model will leverage additional investment for certain criteria, for example, better pay, or full implementation of the curriculum. It is envisaged that this may open alternative mechanisms by which the State could incentivise services to meet national standards in relation to wages and\/or working conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200082#WRZ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Regulation","counter":1650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200082#WRZ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1651,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[28066\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200082#WRZ01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will review a situation in view of the operational and administrative difficulties that arise in which a childcare provider (details supplied) in County Cork has been requested to have two separate registration numbers even though the facilities offered are provided by the same service and at the one address; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1652,"content":"<p>As per my Department's rules for childcare funding programmes, each building must have a unique reference number:<\/p><p>&quot;All facilities\/locations operated by a service must have an individual DCYA reference numberand children must attend the facility\/ location in which they are registered.&quot;<\/p><p>Each building must also be inspected by Tusla's Early Years Inspectorate to ensure it meets all regulatory requirements.

The Courts have repeatedly stated that a decision must be made based on the specific facts of each case, having regard to key tests such as the level of control a would-be employer has over the worker and the level of obligation they have towards each other.<\/p>  <p>  My strong view is that this is a far better mechanism than trying to capture in legislation a definition that can never be black and white. <\/p>  <p>  I have instructed my officials to also explore a range of legislative proposals to complement the increased inspection work that will be key to the long term success of this project.  These proposals include anti-penalisation provisions for workers who will be able to take a claim to the WRC if they are victimised by an employer for raising a query regarding their status; and an increase in penalties for employers who deliberately mis-classify employees as being self-employed. <\/p>  <p>  Scope Section of my Department undertakes investigations on foot of requests from a variety of sources, for example employees, employers or Social Welfare Inspectors.  These investigations cover a variety of situations, for example, modified classes of PRSI for civil and public servants, family employments or insurability of Directors. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200083#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1710,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200083#WRAA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1711,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[27705\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200083#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of increasing payments (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1712,"content":"<p>The costings sought by the Deputy are detailed in the following tables.<\/p><p><i>Table 1: <\/i>Cost of &euro;1 increase in <i>all social insurance payments <\/i><table><tr><th>Scheme<\/th><th>Full year cost of a &euro;1  increase<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Insurance Schemes<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pension Payments <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>22.45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow\/er's Contributory Pension (Aged 66 and over) <\/td><td>4.98<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife's Benefit (Aged 66 and over) <\/td><td>0.34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Death Benefit Pension (Aged 66 and over) <\/td><td>0.03<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Working Age Payments <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow\/er's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Con) Pension<\/td><td>1.55<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife's Benefit<\/td><td>0.15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td>3.23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit<\/td><td>0.09<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)<\/td><td>0.06<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension<\/td><td>0.26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>2.76<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Injury Benefit<\/td><td>0.08<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement<\/td><td>0.05<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td><td>1.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit<\/td><td>0.14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Health and Safety Benefit<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maternity &amp;amp; Adoptive Benefit <\/td><td>1.03<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit <\/td><td>0.04<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Social Insurance Schemes <\/td><td>38.94<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><i>Table 2: Cost of &euro;1 increase in all social assistance payments <\/i><table><tr><th>Scheme<\/th><th>Full year cost of a &euro;1 increase<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Assistance Schemes<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pension Payments <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non Con)<\/td><td>5.03<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance (Aged 66 and over) <\/td><td>0.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Half Rate Carer's Allowance (Aged 66 and over) <\/td><td>0.34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Working Age Payments <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blind Pension<\/td><td>0.07<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow\/ers or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Con) Pension<\/td><td>0.07<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife's Allowance <\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One-Parent Family Payment<\/td><td>2.04<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance<\/td><td>2.22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Half Rate Carer's Allowance <\/td><td>0.59<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory)<\/td><td>0.03<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance <\/td><td>7.83<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance - for those aged 18 to 24 years of age <\/td><td>0.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance - for those aged 25 years of age<\/td><td>0.09<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance<\/td><td>7.94<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Assist<\/td><td>0.44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Education Allowance <\/td><td>0.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance <\/td><td>0.37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Employment <\/td><td>1.25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>T&Uacute;S <\/td><td>0.37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rural Social Scheme <\/td><td>0.22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs Initiative <\/td><td>0.07<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance<\/td><td>0.88<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Social Assistance Schemes <\/td><td>30.85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Overall Total<\/td><td>69.79<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The costs shown above are on a full year basis and are based on the estimated number of recipients in 2019.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>In addition, a considerable number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. <\/p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.

A person may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions.  This and other care-related supports, such as the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant, provide recognition and support for the valuable role of carers.<\/p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks for each person being cared for.  It can be taken in one block or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks.  The current weekly rate is &euro;220.00.  Where a person is caring for two or more care recipients, the rate of payment is increased by 50%.   <\/p>  <p>  At the end of May 2019, there were 2,724 carers in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.

The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of Carer's Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness\/disability, unemployment or caring.  <\/p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.<\/p>  <p>  As of end of May 2019, there were 81,131 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.

A range of employment support grants for people with disabilities and employers are provided under the RAF. <\/p>  <p>  The fund is comprised of - <\/p>  <p>  - Employee Retention Grant: The purpose of the Employee Retention Grant Scheme is to assist employers to retain employees who acquire an illness, condition or impairment which impacts on their ability to carry out their job.  <\/p>  <p>  - Workplace Equipment \/ Adaptation Grant:  Where a person with a disability has been offered employment or is in employment, and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment to do the job, funding \/ a grant will be provided by the department.  <\/p>  <p>  - Personal Reader Grant: If a person is blind or visually impaired and needs assistance with job-related reading, s\/he may be entitled to a grant to allow him\/her to employ a Personal Reader.  <\/p>  <p>  - Job Interview Interpreter Grant: A jobseeker who is deaf, hard of hearing or has speech impairment and is attending job interviews, may apply for funding to have a sign language interpreter or other interpreter to attend the interview with him\/her.  Funding can also be provided to cover the costs of an interpreter during an induction period when starting work. <\/p>  <p>  - Disability Awareness Support Scheme.  This scheme is open to all organisations in the private sector and is available for raising the awareness of personnel at all levels and occupations.  It may be regarded as grant support for staff development programmes that deal with disability etiquette.  The purpose of this scheme is to assist the integration of people with disabilities into the workforce and to eliminate mistaken perceptions about people with disabilities and their capacity to be productive and effective colleagues and employees.<\/p>  <p>  The Department intends to commence a focussed policy review of the Reasonable Accommodation Fund in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200083#WRAA06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Data","counter":1764,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200083#WRAA06100"},{"type":"question","counter":1765,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[28015\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200083#WRAA06200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the full cost of the Christmas bonus for the past five years it was issued; the size of the bonus, for example, 85% or 100%; and if the bonus is included in the expenditure base in each year in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1766,"content":"<p>The Christmas Bonus payment is made to long-term social welfare recipients, such as pensioners, carers, people with disabilities, lone parents and long-term unemployed people who rely wholly or mainly on their social welfare payments for financial support.<\/p><p>The payment of a Christmas Bonus is a discretionary decision made by Government in the context of the annual Budget process and available resources.

Following recent announcements in Budget 2019 the funding for the free travel scheme was increased by &euro;5 million to a total of &euro;95 million.<\/p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance, blind pension and partial capacity benefit.  In 1997 the free travel pass was extended to all registered blind people regardless of whether they qualify for the Department's blind person's pension or any other Social Protection payment.  Blind people remain one of the only cohorts of people aged under 66 who can qualify for a free travel pass while not in receipt of a qualifying Social Protection payment.<\/p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel would have significant costs implications for the free travel scheme and would also require additional administrative processes to be put in place to adjudicate eligibility.  Any decision to do so could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of  Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200084#WRBB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":1805,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200084#WRBB03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1806,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[28102\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070200084#WRBB03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when payment of a disability allowance claim will issue to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1807,"content":"<p>Following a successful appeal, this gentleman has been awarded disability allowance (DA) with effect from 3 October 2018.

The making or amending of a rent scheme is an executive function and is subject to broad principles set out by my Department including that &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  - the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; <\/p>  <p>  - provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship;<\/p>  <p>  - appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1986 when rent setting was devolved to individual local authorities, different approaches have been taken to rent charging and setting across the country.  While local authorities generally follow the Household Means Policy (which applies for assessment of eligibility for social housing) there is variation in the extent to which they apply the income disregards set out in that policy in their Differential Rent Schemes and differing approaches are taken to income sources such as the Working Family Payment or the Carer's Allowance.  My Department does not hold data on the exact approaches taken by individual local authorities as the methodology for calculating rents is a matter for individual housing authorities in the first instance.  <\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft national differential rents framework for the purposes of section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Such a framework has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents related to household income. <\/p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities.  The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable and prioritise those on lowest incomes.

Moving to the 5-10 year cycle represents a significant step forward for the rateable valuation system. <\/p><p>In terms of the process, the Commissioner makes a valuation order, to formally commence the process in each area, a valuation date is set, and the new rateable valuations are then assessed and set by reference to the market conditions and business environment that prevailed on this date. Ultimately, the new valuation list for the Local Authority area is completed and published. <\/p><p>Significant progress is being made on the Programme and the current phase, known as &ldquo;Reval 2019&rdquo;, will see new valuations published on 17<sup><\/sup>September 2019 to become effective from 2020 onwards. Following on from &quot;Reval 2019&quot;, I understand that the Commissioner intends to sign Valuation Orders before the end of 2019 in relation to Donegal, Mayo, Galway City, Galway County, Clare, Kerry, Cork City and Cork County. This will conclude the first revaluation of all rating authority areas. <\/p><p>In relation to second valuations, Fingal County Council is undergoing a second revaluation in 2019 and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown will undergo a second revaluation in 2020. <table><tr><th>Rating Authority<\/th><th>Date of signing of Valuation Order<\/th><th>Valuation Date<\/th><th>Publication Date of Valuation
