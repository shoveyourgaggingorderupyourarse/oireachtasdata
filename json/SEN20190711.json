I hope that she found some benefit and insight into politics in Ireland as opposed to how it works in the United States of America.<\/p><p>In recent days, we have had everyone from the head of the Orange Order to, in an interview with Simon Carswell in today's <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, members of the UVF discussing the issue of a united Ireland.  The concern is that, in the 2019 national risk assessment, which was undertaken by the Department of the Taoiseach and fed into by all Departments and Government agencies, there is no mention of the possibility or probability of there ever being a united Ireland.  Bear in mind that the national risk assessment started in 2014 and literally covers every topic under the sun, including global warming, global terrorism, cybersecurity, the healthcare crisis and the housing crisis.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Under the issue of instability in Northern Ireland, it includes Stormont not being in session.  It also discusses the possibility of another referendum in Scotland on Scottish independence.  However, there is no mention anywhere in the national risk assessment of the possibility or probability of there being a referendum on a united Ireland.<\/p><p>When I and Deputy Fleming asked the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste why uniting the people of Ireland, the main aim of the State under Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, is not in our national risk assessment the Taoiseach replied that he did not see it as a risk, and that it was too important and sensitive to be in the national risk assessment.  The reply of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the issue of a referendum, the preparation required for a referendum, which would come under the remit of both his Department and the Government, and what was being done on that was that it would be dealt with when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland called the referendum.<\/p><p>As we know from Brexit, long-term planning and engagement are required well in advance of holding a referendum.  The lesson from Brexit in Ireland's case is that one should not call a referendum and then try to figure out the future.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is saying in its response to Deputy Fleming and me that it will do the preparation when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland calls the referendum.  There was a court case in Belfast taken by a unionist against the Secretary of State to force her to come up with a policy on how she would determine that the majority of people are in favour of a united Ireland, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  She refused to come up with a policy.  However, under the Northern Ireland Act, the Secretary of State alone decides who gets to vote in that referendum.  That has potential for chaos and for all elements of risk.<\/p><p>That is why Deputy Fleming and I made a submission to the national risk assessment.  We asked that the Government include the issue of a referendum on a new agreed Ireland in the 2019 national risk assessment.  It has not been mentioned in any national risk assessment since 2014, but the Government again refused to include it in the draft risk assessment even though we highlighted the issue to the Taoiseach's office.  I am interested to hear the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as to why the main aim of this State is not included anywhere in our national planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#A00600","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>On behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I thank the Senator for raising this matter.<\/p> <p>First, it is important to point out that the issue of Brexit is separate and distinct from a Border poll.  I believe that to be the case.  The full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements is a priority for the Government.  The approach of the Government to Irish unity is guided by Article 3 of the Constitution, as amended by the people in 1998.  The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are fundamental elements of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island, North and South.<\/p> <p>It is worth recalling the precise wording and provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in this regard.  Under the agreement, the Irish and British Governments, first, \"recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Britain or a sovereign united Ireland\"; second, \"recognise that it is for the people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland\"; and, third, \"affirm that if, in the future, the people of the island of Ireland exercise their right of self-determination on the basis set out above, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish\".<\/p> <p>The holding of a referendum in this jurisdiction is therefore connected with the calling of a Border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland.  While the decision to hold such a poll in Northern Ireland rests with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Government of Ireland does not believe it likely at present that such a Border poll in the near future would result in a decision on the part of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland in favour of constitutional change.  In these circumstances, it is the Government's view that a referendum on Irish unity against the background of the ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland and the increased uncertainty created by Brexit would only add to that uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time for everybody on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>In the absence of the prospect of a referendum in the near future, the Government has not made specific preparations on this issue and does not have immediate plans to do so.  The Government's immediate priorities are twofold, namely, to ensure the protection of the agreement in all its parts and the gains and benefits of the peace process in the context of UK withdrawal from the EU, and to secure the functioning of the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and the North-South Ministerial Council.  As the Senator is aware, the Government is currently actively involved in a talks process to achieve that.<\/p> <p>Issues of risk relating to Northern Ireland are considered as part of the annual national risk assessment.  Although a Border poll would not be regarded as a risk, and the very important and sensitive policy issues related to it would not be dealt with in the risk assessment process, the question of relationships on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain is always considered as part of the annual national risk assessment.  In this regard, the national risk assessment was one of the first official acknowledgements of the risks posed by a potential Brexit, including associated risks for Northern Ireland.  Further reflecting the Government's commitment to identifying, preparing for and mitigating risk, earlier this week the Government published its updated Brexit contingency action plan.  This reflects the extensive work which has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis, including the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act, to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.  It sets out the next steps to be taken between now and 31 October.  It also makes clear that it will pose particular risks for the Good Friday Agreement, the all-island economy and for Northern Ireland's economy, political stability and community relations.<\/p> <p>In the event of a future referendum within the consent provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government has confirmed that it would make all necessary preparations in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and the principles and procedures of the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#B00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  With regard to his last statement that the Government will prepare for the referendum when it is triggered by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Government is clearly not learning the lessons of Brexit.  It will only take action when the referendum is called.  We all know that a referendum, particularly on the issue of unifying Ireland, requires long-term engagement, indeed, years of engagement, and not just when the Secretary of State calls a referendum.  That would only give us months.<\/p> <p>Finally, I will refer to the Taoiseach's statement in the national risk assessment in 2018 about the overview.  He said the aim of the national risk assessment was to counteract groupthink and to ensure all voices are heard by the Government.  He said it seeks to prevent a repeat of mistakes of the past when dissenting voices were not heeded, leading to catastrophic consequences for the people of Ireland.  For the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach to state that they did not see a Border poll as a risk and that it was too sensitive to be in the national risk assessment beggars belief.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Even the Minister must be questioning the reply he was asked to give here today, which states: \"Although a Border poll would not be regarded as a risk, and the very important and sensitive policy issues related to it would not be dealt with in the risk assessment process ...\".

The Minister of State has got an expanded brief today.  As the other Members are in absentia, I know the response will probably not be very satisfactory but I thank him for coming to the House.<\/p><p>By way of background, in 2012, an expert group was appointed to review the Mental Health Act 2001 by the then Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, and in 2015, a total of 165 recommendations were made.  That seems like an eon ago but nothing has happened since then.<\/p><p>As a former psychiatric nurse and union representative, I was very involved with the review of the Mental Health Act and the law in terms of those working on the ground also.  We saw that there was a dire need for the Act to be overhauled.  Its aim was to protect people who go into hospital to avail of mental health care and treatment.<\/p><p>To date, only two of the expert group&rsquo;s recommendations have come into effect<b>.  <\/b>The Government has failed to meet its own timetable.  In June 2016, the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Helen McEntee, publicly stated that this would be done by the end of that year.  Since then, numerous dates have been given for publication of the draft legislation but nothing has happened.  These delays are hugely problematic given the lengthy duration of the review of the Act to date and the seriousness of the gaps in human rights protections for adults and children receiving inpatient mental health treatment.<\/p><p>We are all in favour of moving away from antiquated, Victorian-like methods to modern day treatments where people can have a say and be included in their treatment.  That provides people with ownership of their treatment and it is much more effective and beneficial for the patient in terms of their recovery.<\/p><p>We are still only at the infant stage of this process, which has been going on a long time.  We are waiting for new legislation but a body of work can be done in the meantime.  I had legislation ready but, unfortunately, it was rejected.  It concerns 16- to 17-year olds consenting to treatment.  An anomaly exists in respect of the human rights of those individuals.  Teenagers of that age can consent to physical treatment and dental treatment but when it comes to treatment of the spirit or the mind, whatever one wants to call it, they are not allowed consent.  It will only take one young person to take this issue to the High Court for this Government to move very quickly on it, as it did earlier last year following instructions of the High Court on detention for periods of more than six months in a psychiatric hospital.<\/p><p>I acknowledge Deputy Buckley in the Gallery.  Yesterday, I moved First Stage of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2019, which goes a long way towards protecting the rights of involuntary patients.<\/p><p>I have been naive in the past but in the three and a half years I have been a Member of the Seanad, I have become much more clued in to the way politics works.  When one sits down with the Minister or officials in the Department of Health, one comes away wanting to shut down the Department.  Are they so mean that they cannot share democracy?  They covet everything.  Measures cannot be seen to come from the Opposition yet it is in the spirit of democracy and the human rights of involuntarily incarcerated people that we try to give voice to them.  That is not being allowed to happen because work has not yet been done on this reform yet Opposition Members like myself and Deputy Pat Buckley are working away on it.  The Bill was passed by the legislative department here.  We have worked very hard on the Bill only for it to be shut down without an alternative being offered other than to say it will be dealt with later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#C01300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator.

I certainly do not think she is naive.<\/p> <p>On behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who is abroad this week on Government business, I thank the Senator for asking this very important question.  As she will know, the expert group review of the 2001 Mental Health Act was completed in 2015.  The group&rsquo;s final report had 165 recommendations, most of which relate to changes to the 2001 Act.  Shortly after publication, the then Government gave approval to prepare the heads of an amending mental health Bill to reflect the group&rsquo;s recommendations.<\/p> <p>Among the many changes to be made are the proposed expansion of the existing authorised officer service to play a more prominent role in examining alternatives to inpatient treatment as well as initiating applications for involuntary admission, the review of the detention of patients after 14 days rather than 21 days and also, as the Senator will be aware, allowing 16 and 17 year olds the right to consent to or refuse mental health treatment.<\/p> <p>I can now inform the House that a draft of these heads has been finalised by the Department of Health and were passed on to the Mental Health Commission last week.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, wishes to stress the importance he attaches to allowing the commission, and this is reasonable, which has an in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of the Act, to contribute to the detail of the Bill.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is on record in the Oireachtas and elsewhere stating that while it is a matter of regret to him that it has taken time to bring these heads to draft stage, nonetheless, this work had to be balanced with the many other calls on the Department of Health to progress not only emergency and Private Members-related legislation but also other mental health strategies and agendas relating to services.<\/p> <p>Work on the Bill by the Department has been front-loaded and the commission has effectively been provided with text that is far more detailed than heads alone and represents what the Bill itself would look like.  We believe this should ultimately reduce the time required to finalise the actual text, once Government approve the heads of the Bill.<\/p> <p>Some have asked if the current draft will be published and whether there will be an opportunity to comment on its contents.  The fact is that this is an unfinished and effectively internal draft currently subject to comment from the experts who understand the detailed operation of how the 2001 Act operates.  Following consultation with the commission, and when the heads are finalised and approved by Government, they will then be published.<\/p> <p>Before the expert group began to discuss the revision of the 2001 Act, there was a full public consultation on the changes that should be made.  Some 116 submissions were received at that time and the changes proposed fed into the workings of the expert group.<\/p> <p>In addition, as the Bill proceeds through the legislative process, Oireachtas Members and all key stakeholders will have an opportunity to provide further input.

This matter speaks for itself.  There was a lot of talk about this area well in advance of last year's referendum to remove the prohibition on abortion.  A working group has been set up by the Minister to see how we will go about providing contraception to women in this country.  A public consultation was also launched and is closing on 5 August.  I urge the public to partake in that and to give their feedback.  That is a prudent way to do business, when making policy, but there is an urgency that needs to be observed.<\/p> <p>During the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, there was little public discussion of the ancillary recommendations which, to my mind, are extremely important, namely, sex education and contraception, which are fundamental to preventing unwanted pregnancies.  That is the crux of this issue, as far as I am concerned.  It comes to a point where we have to accept that we have heard all the expert evidence.  The Minister has indicated that this is his intention.  The October budget is looming.  I sincerely hope that, once the public consultation has concluded, the Minister would hear from the working group he has set up in very early course, so this matter can be seriously considered for this budget and for implementation in January.<\/p> <p>We cannot have a health service in which termination services are provided freely and contraceptives are not.  This goes to the crux of a progressive health system.  LARCs, long acting reversible contraceptives, such as coils and implants, are the most effective method of preventing unintended pregnancy and have a high satisfaction rating.  A contraceptive programme which excludes LARCs may incentivise women to opt for less effective methods, such as condoms or oral contraceptives.  This exposes them to an increased risk of unintended pregnancy.  The availability of a wide range of methods is important because each woman's medical history and risk factors are unique and there is no one-size-fits-all contraceptive method that works for everyone.  Furthermore, women's contraceptive needs change throughout their lives and there needs to be that adaptability in the system.<\/p> <p>It is complicated enough but we are in danger of over-complicating it.  This is something that needs to happen.  If we are serious about gender equality, access to contraception is fundamental to women's empowerment.  Political commitments were made in this area and I would like to see them realised in this budget.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#D00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  I commend Senator Noone on the wonderful work she did as Chair of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, where her direction was incisive and very progressive.<\/p> <p>As I am sure the Senator is aware, the issue of access to contraception has been the subject of particular attention in recent months following on from the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly to improve women&rsquo;s access to reproductive health services and the recommendation of Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution to introduce a scheme to provide &ldquo;the most effective method of contraception, free of charge and having regard to personal circumstances, to all people who wish to avail of them within the State.&rdquo;  Following on from these recommendations, the Minister, Deputy Harris, established a working group within the Department of Health to examine the range of policy, regulatory and legislative issues arising in regard to improving access to contraception.  The group has been working since 30 April and launched a public consultation earlier this week.  The Minister would encourage everyone to have their say in what will be a fundamental policy change.  It is intended that this group will report back to the Minister at the end of September with recommendations on policy options and next steps.<\/p> <p>More generally, the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme has responsibility for the implementation of the national sexual health strategy 2015-20.  The programme is supportive of initiatives that facilitate access to contraception for women, including long acting reversible contraception, LARC, such as intra-uterine devices, subdermal implants and so on.  The high efficacy rates associated with LARC in preventing crisis pregnancies are well-recognised.  Crucially, there is no potential for user error with LARC, which makes it more effective than other methods of contraception, given that many crisis pregnancies occur due to failure of the contraceptive method or incorrect use on the part of some people.<\/p> <p>With regard to use of LARC among women in Ireland, the last Irish contraception and crisis pregnancy study suggested that uptake is at a low level but increasing across all age groups.  This study found that the proportion of women aged between 18 and 45 using LARC rose from 5.7% in 2003 to 10.9% in 2010, although I do not know the statistics after that date.  We know there are barriers to accessing contraception, and cost certainly appears to be an issue for some women in regard to LARC.  Data suggest that among women who had considered using LARC, 27% said the costs associated with this type of contraception prevented them from choosing this method.  However, we must also remember that hormonal LARC devices are provided free of charge to those with medical cards, which is an important measure in terms of addressing access to contraception.  It is also important to acknowledge there can be other barriers to contraception aside from cost, such as difficulty accessing services in a particular locality or feelings of embarrassment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Halligan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, in the United Kingdom, where contraceptive services and supplies are free of charge, a high proportion of pregnancies are still deemed unwanted or unintended.

We should all be very grateful for that but it is not that long ago that a woman needed a man's consent to get contraception in this country.  It is not that long ago that it was illegal.  It was only legalised in 1979 and then only in restricted circumstances where a person was married.  We have come a long way but, if we are to be a progressive society, termination services cannot be freely available to women while contraceptive services are not.  This is about gender equality.  I want to live a country in which women are empowered in this area.  I hope the Minister will hear from his working group in the middle of September rather than at the end.  We know the information.

At the same time, we should not lose sight of the fact that the Irish contraception and crisis pregnancy study showed that 88% of respondents did not report difficulty in accessing contraception.  The data also show that 78% of sexually active heterosexual adults who did not wish to conceive used contraception at all times.

Members will know that this Act was introduced to provide a new streamlined arrangement for fast-tracking housing that is of a strategic nature, includes more than 100 units or is student accommodation.  When that legislation was passed by both Houses, the Minister rightly gave a commitment that it would be reviewed within two years.  We have learned much from this process.  We have learned that, despite all the fast-track planning permission granted under this arrangement, very little housing has been developed.  I live close to a large site for which permission for a substantial development was granted.  The buildings were knocked down, a fence was erected and the land has now trebled in value with no builders on site.  This legislation allows the fast-tracking of planning with blocked out third party appeals.  In simple terms, that means our citizens are not able to make submissions about those developments.  We have added millions to the fortunes of developers, yet in many cases they have not built even one new home.  All this legislation has done is give them fast-track planning permission and allowed them to bypass public engagement, which is not tolerated anywhere in Europe, while they sit on valuable sites and vast wealth.<\/p> <p>The legislation was to be reviewed by the Minister after two years.  I am pleased the Minister placed an advertisement in the national press yesterday stating there would be a public consultation process, but it would have to be completed and submissions received from the public by 25 July.  That is to be acknowledged.  All of us in this Chamber need to get out and tell people that they now have an opportunity to make a public submission on this fast-track planning process, and that they need to make a submission to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government by 25 July 2019.  I have written to the Department today and asked it to circulate the public consultation notice to every public representative, whether in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad or a city or county council.  This is really important.  It is built into the legislation, in fairness.  We are lawmakers and it is good that the provision is in place.  I hope we can encourage members of the public to engage in this process.  We cannot and should not allow developers to bypass public consultation or communities, secure planning permission that adds to the value of their lands and then sit on those sites without developing housing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#H00800","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>As we are coming to the end of our session, I want to thank the staff of the Houses for their support and patience throughout the term.

He pointed out that on 4 July, Miami Air M758MA, which is on contract to the US military, stopped in Shannon to refuel on its way back to the United States from the Middle East.  Significantly, its destination in the Middle East was Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, just across the Red Sea from Yemen, where up to 100,000 children have died as the result of a war perpetrated by Saudi Arabia and its coalition.  This is not the only aeroplane that has come through Shannon Airport to support that war.  Mid-air refuelling planes landed at the airport last year.  As the name suggests, these aircraft help refuel planes so they can continue bombing.  Of all the wars in the world right now, the war in Yemen is perhaps the most horrific in terms of civilian deaths, and civilian slaughter from bombs in particular.

In a 15 minute conversation in the company of my management team, he put me through my paces with a small number of searching questions.  He then asked me to tell him of two or three things that define the lives of people with disabilities.  He said he liked doing things in threes.

I last met him on 27 February, when he agreed to be my guest speaker here in Leinster House where he addressed disability organisations on the relevance of the Seanad to their public benefit work.

I support the T&aacute;naiste's critique, reported today, of the leadership contenders for the Conservative Party as an \"utterly disingenuous debate\".  As British-US relations deteriorate to a new low following the forced resignation of the British ambassador to the US, Mr. Kim Darroch, we can only watch in dismay the developments in British politics and just hope that sense will be seen over the summer, and that there will be some move by the British side to ensure we do not see a chaotic and catastrophic no-deal Brexit in October.<\/p> <p>Will the Leader ensure we have a debate early post-recess on the new exclusion zone legislation promised by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris? I have been calling for this legislation for some months now, as have others.  Certainly, the need for the passage of such legislation has become more pressing as we have seen awful protests taking place outside hospitals, especially the Holles Street National Maternity Hospital.  These people are opposed to abortion, which in itself is fine because this is their democratic view, but very distressing images and props are being used and it appears they are seeking to intimidate and obstruct women who are accessing services, and others who seek to access maternity services.  This includes women who may have received devastating diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormality and family members who may be visiting very ill premature babies in hospital.  These protests are not democratic and they should not be supported by anyone who has any compassion.  I hope we see exclusion zone legislation coming in to protect women seeking to access services that were democratically voted for by the people in the referendum last year.<\/p> <p>I note that 3 August this year marks the fifth anniversary of the horrific massacre of the Yazidi community in Iraq by ISIS.  This will be marked by the UN and by the international community.  I wanted to inform colleagues that this will be taking place on 3 August.<\/p> <p>I wish everyone well over the recess.

I welcome the recent launch by the Government of a draft marine planning policy statement.  The size of our offshore area is ten times the landmass of our island.  The Irish continental shelf comprises 220 million acres.  As well as being relatively unexplored, we have a very poor spatial planning system with regard to developing offshore renewables, for preserving biodiversity in these ocean waters, and for preserving our marine heritage.  As we look towards the sea and we recognise the asset that is there, we also see a lot of shortcomings around the legislation and a lot of work we have to do.  We also need a debate so we can be more enlightened and create a bigger conversation about what an asset and what resources we have in the sea.<\/p> <p>In that regard I compliment all of the work of Dr. Peter Heffernan and the Marine Institute, which has run the Our Ocean summit and is heavily involved in SeaFest, which has been held in Galway for the past three years and took place in Cork this year.  The Leader may be quite familiar with it.  Two years ago RT&Eacute; broadcast a three part series \"The Deep Atlantic\".  This used some of the seafaring vessels of the Marine Institute and went out there.  The wildlife and the marine life out there is amazing.  It would benefit us to conduct a debate such as I have mentioned as we go forward to create a national marine planning framework.  We must prioritise the creation of a proper planning and development system for our offshore territory.  Sadly, such a system does not exist currently.  It means that if we are to develop offshore wind or wave energy, it is highly complicated with different agencies required.  It definitely is not an holistic approach.<\/p> <p>The Leader might give some consideration to organising such a debate, along with a debate on Mercosur with the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the House, which is a priority.

There are alternatives.  The Republic of Ireland has only 1% of the population of Europe.  We should have special consideration because of our unique historical and personal links with the United Kingdom.  It is time to review the situation and see if there is any possibility that we will have a stronger relationship through a joint UK and Irish special economic zone within the European Union.  It is possible.  There are zones within the European Union.  I do not believe it was pursued by the Government or that it has looked at alternatives.

I had never met the man before in my life although I met him several times afterwards.  He was at the forefront of so many changes in society and he will be dearly missed.  The summer around Ireland will not be the same without Brendan Grace.  That has to be said.<\/p> <p>This weekend we have commemoration ceremonies at Islandbridge on Saturday and at Collins Barracks on Sunday.  The Islandbridge affair this year will be attended by a fairly large contingent from the former Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR.  There are many different interpretations as to the history of the UDR.  I had the privilege some weeks ago of addressing a gathering of the UDR.  The topic I chose was collusion.  I spoke openly about collusion during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and about the atrocities that were committed.  I also spoke about the decent men and women who were members of the Ulster Defence Regiment, who got out of their houses in the evening and patrolled Northern Ireland, who guarded vital installations and made sure that terrorist movements around Northern Ireland were disrupted.  That is not for one moment excusing the fact that terrorists were also involved in that organisation.  However, there were decent men and women there who did what they thought was right.  The interesting thing about the UDR establishment is the number of Catholics who were involved in the early days.  They were run out of it, not by Protestants but by Catholics.  I am delighted that some of them will attend Islandbridge this year.  It is a great step forward.<\/p> <p>I refer to the constant calls we are getting for a Border poll.  People in Northern Ireland know the direction this country is moving in.  They do not need to be goaded or constantly threatened.  I was asked recently by a group of unionists in Northern Ireland if it was true that we would put them in concentration camps when the unification takes place.  I was appalled to be asked that question but it is actually a belief that is held among some.  I must compliment the Government on taking a softly, softly approach in the entire area of Northern Ireland and I ask for this to continue.

The EU is not negotiating on our behalf; we are part of it and it has showed great solidarity with us.<\/p> <p>A backstop with a time limit is not a backstop.  People talk about technological solutions but there is nowhere in the world where those solutions have proved successful.  Six weeks ago our committee for the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly went to Crossmaglen PSNI station looking at illicit trading across the Border.  We stopped in Newry and were transferred by eight armoured cars for the 16 miles to Crossmaglen as is normal for bringing PSNI men to Crossmaglen.  There were two cameras at the PSNI station.  All the other cameras in south Armagh for checking vehicle registration plates have been cut down.  This is not a normal area.  The British Government and the diplomats know that it is not Hereford or Watford.  This is south Armagh in Northern Ireland.  We saw it ourselves when we were going in the gate.  The gate was rammed the night before.  We asked them what they do and they said they do nothing.  Anybody who thinks there can be a border on the island of Ireland is missing the fact that we are in a highly dangerous situation.  We are part of the EU 27 and they have been loyal to us and have showed us massive solidarity.<\/p> <p>There is a problem and it is the Conservative Party.  This is about uniting the Conservative Party and it is not about anything else.

The agency is actively engaged with councillors in Dublin on State landbanks, and it is particularly active in Balbriggan in Fingal, where there is potential for 800 homes, and in Skerries, where there is potential for 200 homes.  It is also engaged in the development for 550 homes of the former Shanganagh Prison site in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and it will be engaged in the redevelopment of the former Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.

In recent years, Noel was a great support and showed me a huge amount of kindness and encouragement right back to 2015 when he contacted me about my two daughters and a campaign video they did for the same-sex marriage referendum.  We had numerous communications subsequently.  He also facilitated some of the most memorable occasions I have had in the past few years when I visited Wexford.  The memories are quite surreal.  Funnily enough, one of them relates to a lunch with Brendan Grace.  I am sure Brendan Grace would have some sort of dark joke about the fact that I sat down with him and Noel Whelan for dinner this time last year.  It was lovely to be able to sit in their company and it is lovely to remember them that way.  When I met Brendan last year, I was immediately attracted to the good-natured boldness in him.  I wish we had got to know each other a lot more, but it was a pleasure to sit and have dinner with Noel and Brendan together last year.  It is a nice memory and it was my privilege to know two Irish icons in different areas, one in music and comedy and the other in the political and democratic realm.  I send my condolences to each of their families, especially Brendan's son-in-law, who has also been in contact with me in recent days.  He was not only a son-in-law to Brendan but an extremely close friend to him.  The two of them were inseparable last year in Wexford and they seemed to really look after each other.

That was a really nice thing to hear from such a wonderful man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#M00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Did the Senator greet them with her fist salute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#M00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Like others here, I wish to speak about the passing of two great people.  I got to know Noel Whelan after I was first elected to this House.  He made contact with me in 2011 and we discussed many things.  I subsequently met him on numerous occasions.  I always admired him because he went into politics, he stood for Fianna F&aacute;il and it did not work out but he was not afraid of expressing his views, regardless of whether people agreed with him.  He did so in the most articulate way imaginable, especially during the marriage equality referendum campaign and that relating to the eighth amendment, on which he took a very particular stance and was not afraid or shy about putting his case forward.  I did not know Brendan Grace but I do know he spent an awful lot of time in County Clare.  He purchased a pub in Killaloe.  I know many people who knew him well and who speak extremely fondly of him.  He spent many nights in the Armada Hotel in Spanish Point as an entertainer and as a guest.  I understand that he was there very recently.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha d&iacute;lse.  We pass on our sympathies to their families and wish them well in dealing with their grief.<\/p> <p>Since this is the final Order of Business before the summer recess, it is appropriate that we thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Cathaoirleach, the Clerk, Martin Groves, the Clerk Assistant, Bridget Doody, and all the team in the Seanad Office who ensure that this House runs smoothly.  It is also appropriate that we thank the rest of the staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I refer to the ushers and the support staff in the various sections, including the canteen, the Library, the Bills Office and so on.  If it were not for them, the House would not be able to function.  I hope they have an enjoyable, relaxing summer.  There are lots of activities in County Clare.  If they wish to visit us, they would be very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#M00400","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I join in the thanks to all the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Many of them will continue to work during the summer, and I thank them for that too.<\/p> <p>I second Senator Gavan's suggestion that we have a debate on military transport through Shannon when the House returns in September.  I have heard calls for such a debate on many occasions.  It is overdue in light of the very hawkish atmosphere that obtains internationally.  The assertion of and clarity surrounding Ireland's neutrality and its role as a peace-building nation are more important now than ever before.  Ursula von der Leyen, her country's Minister for Defence, is the proposed candidate for President of the European Commission.  We need to be crystal clear to our European allies and countries across the world that our unique voice is one that is for disarmament, peace-building and neutrality.<\/p> <p>In the context of peace-building, I wish to make a special call, which the Leader pass on.  I had hoped to have a Commencement matter on this today but, due to the number of matters tabled, it was not taken.  Civil society in Sudan has been expressing very clearly and strongly the need and desire for a transition to a civilian-led government.  For those of us who care about democracy, it is a really important moment.  After 30 years of dictatorship we have a vibrant, young, dynamic and inclusive Sudanese civil society wishing to engage in peace negotiations and have a civilian government.  Ethiopia has stepped in as mediator, but Ireland can have a role in ensuring we see meaningful negotiations, that the result of those negotiations is a genuinely democratic civilian-led government and that the lives of civilian protestors are protected.  I say this particularly in the context of major days of action this weekend, on 13 and 14 July.  I ask the Leader to pass on to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade a request that Ireland indicate that it is watching to ensure there is no violence against protesters.  The other issue the new European Commission must deal with over the summer is the fact that European funding is going to the rapid support forces in Sudan, now operating without any government.  Many fear that these forces have very strong and inappropriate links to the Janjaweed, who have been engaging in violence against civilians.  We must therefore look to suspension of European funding, much as the African Union has temporarily suspended Sudan's membership of the union pending successful negotiations towards a civilian government.<\/p> <p>This leads me to one important point.  I say all this because democracy matters.  One person who cared passionately about democracy and politics was Noel Whelan.  I also had the opportunity to work with him a little on the marriage equality and repeal of the eighth amendment campaigns but also as part of Democracy Matters.  He was somebody who believed passionately in the importance of politics.  He was humorous, he was an analyst and he was strategic.  Most of all, he believed that politics was important, and I know he encouraged so many people to engage in politics.  I urge that when we come back from the summer recess this Seanad look to how we can fulfil the vision, which Noel put forward, for a more democratic Seanad in which everyone has a voice.  I join in sending my sympathies to all his family and his many diverse friends across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#M00500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I wish to be associated with the Senators' kind remarks to the families of the late Brendan Grace and Noel Whelan.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">An Leas-Chathaoirleach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They both will be a huge loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#M00600","speaker":"1420","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank 16 Members of the House for their contributions to the Order of Business.  On my own behalf and that of the Fine Gael group and the House, I extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Brenda Grace - his wife, Eileen, and his four children - on his sad passing.  As has been eloquently described here this morning, he was a gentle person, a person of huge compassion and a great entertainer.  His tragic loss, as Senator Ruane eloquently said, is felt by his family more than anybody else.  We offer them our condolences and sympathy.  They are in our thoughts.<\/p> <p>Noel Whelan was a person I got to know well and I spent many an hour in a radio studio engaging with him.  He was an extraordinary person.  His intellect was one of the best I ever encountered.  His ability to mould a campaign, whether retention of the Seanad, marriage equality or repeal the eighth, was extraordinary.  To his wife, Sin&eacute;ad, their son, S&eacute;amus, and his family, we offer our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss, and at a very young age as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Davitt raised the issue of councillors' pay and conditions.  As the Senator will be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, commissioned Ms Sara Moorhead SC to chair a review.  Publication of the review is imminent and we will have that debate in the new term.  I join with Senator Davitt in recognising that there is a need for the pay and conditions of councillors to be improved.<\/p> <p>The Senator made reference to the European Commission, as did Senator Bacik, in terms of the Commissioner appointments.  Our country, as the Senators will be aware, has nominated the current Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, to be reappointed.  I note Dr. von der Leyen has asked for two.  We all support the principle of gender balance.  Unfortunately, it is well beyond my pay grade to give Senator Davitt the name of the person this morning, if there will be one.  My personal view is that member states should retain their right to be able to nominate their own Commissioner and I would not like to see that being taken away from member states.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  As Members will be aware, the commencement order was signed two years ago.  Since then, we have seen 7,102 houses and 4,479 student bed spaces approved.  Last year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, within the 16 weeks, dealt with 39 cases.  I note there was a case before the courts this week where the Southwood Park Residents' Association won a High Court decision against An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is a balance to be struck regarding the fast-tracking of planning but there is also, as Senator Boyhan referenced, the need for an input from residents.  We will have that debate in due course.<\/p> <p>Senators Gavan and Higgins made reference to Shannon Airport.  As Leader of the House, I have never ducked anywhere from anything.  Senator Gavan has an opportunity in the Commencement debate to raise the issue of Shannon Airport any day he wants to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#N00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I have done that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#N00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>If the Senator has done that, he has had his opportunity.

Senators Craughwell and Devine made reference to the commemoration ceremony next weekend and I join him in welcoming that event.  As Senator Devine rightly said, it is about healing.  It is about remembering our past and not forgetting it.  It is also about moving forward collectively.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine made reference to the autism spectrum disorder waiting list in Waterford.  This is an issue of concern and my information is that the HSE is endeavouring to ensure equality of access and is trying to improve waiting lists and waiting times, not only in Waterford but across the country.  That is why it is in the process of hiring 15 additional child psychologists.  In the short term, it may require an extension of waiting times, which is regrettable.  It is about ensuring that we have access to treatment, care, support and assessment.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is endeavouring to find a pathway to expedite waiting times and access to services.  It is a huge issue and it is a challenge that must be overcome.  I accept the point the Senator made.<\/p> <p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of housing and the Land Development Agency.  As the Senator will be aware, the agency is up and running and there is an interim board under the chairmanship of Mr. John Moran.   The agency is currently working on eight sites with seven more being actively pursued.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, come to the House in the new term.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins raised Sudan.  The point here is an important one.  We have seen dialogue between the military and the opposition.  I concur completely with the Senator that there is a need to see a civilian government put in place.  There is a need for us, in the context of our campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council, to take a more proactive role and to be that flag-bearer and facilitator.  I would be happy to work with Senator Higgins.  We can talk to the Minister about the matter.<\/p> <p>On a positive note, I extend my congratulations and I hope those of House to Rory O'Neill, that is, Panti, and his husband, Anderson Cabrera, on their marriage yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#N01400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#N01500","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#N01600","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>We should finish on a positive note.

I am pleased to introduce the CervicalCheck Tribunal Bill 2019 to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  At the outset, I acknowledge the sincere bi-partisan effort in the other House, which I know will be in this House too, to get this done so that we can provide an alternative pathway to court for women seeking answers and justice in the botched CervicalCheck audit.  I sincerely thank Members for taking this legislation so promptly and facilitating this debate.<\/p> <p>I wish advise Members that the D&aacute;il Business Committee agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny in the case of this Bill to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider it with a view to enactment before our summer recess, and certainly before the Seanad's summer recess.  Meeting this milestone will enable the tribunal to be established before the end of the year and to begin hearing cases as soon as possible.  For women, some of whom are unwell, this timeline is obviously crucial.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this important legislation is to establish an independent statutory tribunal to deal with claims arising from the CervicalCheck controversy.  The Bill is based on the recommendations set out by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan in his 2018 Report on An Alternative System For Dealing With Claims Arising From Cervical Check.  I thank the excellent Mr. Justice Charles Meenan for giving his time and sharing his expert advice in this regard.  We have tried to stay true to his findings and recommendations in that report.<\/p> <p>Following the issues which emerged last year, it is safe to say there is much greater awareness of the limitations of cervical screening and screening in general, and we will be aware that false negatives and false positives arise in all screening programmes in Ireland and internationally.  As Mr. Justice Meenan noted in his report, where a woman develops cervical cancer following a negative smear test, this is not, in and of itself, evidence of negligence.  There is a difference between a false negative and negligence.  To establish negligence evidence has to be given from a suitably qualified expert that the reading of the smear fell below the appropriate standard required, and this evidence needs to be adjudicated on.<\/p> <p>Recognising that any alternative system to the court process would need to recognise the issue of liability, Mr. Justice Meenan proposed that a tribunal be established under statute for the purpose of hearing and determining claims arising in relation to CervicalCheck.  This Bill does exactly that.  It also provides, very importantly, for restoration of trust meetings.  That is a really important point because trust has been broken and damaged.  I have met many of the women impacted from this situation.  Those restoration of trust meetings could be of real value in getting to where we need to get to on our screening programme and in bringing a degree of closure and answers for the women involved.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In that context, this Bill takes account of what Mr. Justice Meenan stated in his report and the views expressed by Dr. Gabriel Scally last year in the final report of the scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme.  Restoration of trust meetings is, of course, not part of the courts process but it is an important part of this legislation.  We need to re-emphasise that the CervicalCheck screening programme has played a vital role in saving lives.  We all know that.  Despite its shortcomings and limitations regarding the audit process, we should not, and we will not, take away from that reality.  It is, therefore, essential that women and their families have confidence in the programme and continue to use the programme. <br\/><br\/>Before going into the detail of the Bill, I would like to give further context and set out some of the important steps taken so far to deal with CervicalCheck issues.  These include the reports by Dr. Gabriel Scally, supports for women and their families, and changes to the HSE's open disclosure policy and practice.  A further significant initiative is the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme for women affected by non-disclosure.  Payments have so far been made to more than 80 individuals impacted by non-disclosure.  The scheme's independent assessment panel met and is continuing its work.  I understand that further payments will be made in the coming days.  We are, crucially, implementing the recommendations in Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report in full and we have accepted the two further recommendations from his recent supplementary report.  My aim, my vision and my policy, and that of this House, is to effectively eradicate cervical cancer.  That is not pie in the sky and it is not a lofty political aspiration.  It is something that we can do and it is something I genuinely believe that we will do through a combination of a robust screening programme, a move to HPV testing and, crucially, the introduction of the HPV vaccine for boys and the continuing promotion of the vaccine for girls.  <br\/><br\/>We also have to push back against the myths - we are not allowed to say &quot;lies&quot; in this House - disinformation and misinformation that is put forward regarding vaccinations.  I will bring forward a motion in support of the vaccination programme in the other House and I would also like to bring it into this House.  I hope all of the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, regardless of party affiliation, will state clearly that they support the HPV vaccine for boys and girls and the child's immunisation programme.  I hope as well that Members of both Houses will stop writing letters to me trying to question the validity of that vaccination.  They are doing serious harm to people, present company excluded of course.  There is, of course, a legitimate role for asking questions but giving succour to misinformation about vaccines has resulted in deaths in this country.  I promised Laura Brennan that we will do everything we possibly can to reverse that trend.  I know I have great cross-party support in this House for that approach as well.  <br\/><br\/>The HSE continues to strengthen governance, quality assurance and management in the CervicalCheck programme and the wider national screening service in line with Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations.  This is a key point.  Great work was done by the CervicalCheck screening programme and that is still being done.  It is fair to say, however, that it was somewhat operating as an island and a silo.  When Dr. Scally looked closely at the programme, he found a real need for proper governance structures, proper management structures and clarity on how the programme links in with the wider health service.  <br\/><br\/>Turning to supports for women affected, something important for all of us here, funding has been provided to the 221+ Patient Support Group to enable advocacy and supports to be made available to these patients.  I also announced last year the establishment of a primary and social care support package for women and families affected by the CervicalCheck issues. This comprehensive package of supports is for the cohort of 221+ women for whom the audit carried out by CervicalCheck found discordance with the original reading of their slides.  The package will also be provided to any other woman for whom the independent clinical expert review currently being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, identifies discordance with her original smear test reading.  Members will be aware that this review is ongoing and that its purpose is to provide women with independent clinical assurance about the quality of the screening programme and the timing of diagnosis and treatment.<br\/><br\/>I also want to mention open disclosure.  This goes to the heart of the matter for many of the women concerned.  Audits are a good thing and we should encourage them but we should also be disclosing and openly disclosing information.  When things go wrong in our health service, and things go wrong in every health service, it is important that people disclose information.  It is important that patients - women and men - get information.  It is also important, however, that our clinicians can disclose in an environment where they know how that process will work.  What we saw at the heart of the CervicalCheck audit debacle was mass confusion regarding what the open disclosure policy was and whose job it was to disclose.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome the new open disclosure policy published by the HSE.  It is in line with recommendation 28 of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report, which emphasised that the policy should be revised to reflect the primacy of the rights of patients to have full knowledge about their healthcare and, in particular, their right to be informed about failings in that care process, however, and whenever, they may arise.  The interim policy will be further reviewed when the patient safety Bill is published.  I look forward to returning to this House in the autumn with the full patient safety Bill, which will provide for mandatory open disclosure of patient safety incidents.  It is at an advanced stage.<br\/><br\/>Turning now to this Bill, I want to present an overview of the general principles.  The tribunal will hear and determine liability for claims regarding CervicalCheck, subject to the consent of all the parties to the claim.  The Bill sets out who may make a claim and the period within which claims may be made.  The Bill enables the tribunal to determine and adopt pre-claim protocols and enables the chairperson to issue practice directions regarding the conduct of claims, in the interests of hearing and determining claims in a manner which is just and expeditious.  The tribunal&rsquo;s determination of a claim may be appealed to the High Court.  Where a claimant accepts an award and where no appeal is made, the tribunal will apply to the High Court for confirmation of that determination.  <br\/><br\/>The tribunal&rsquo;s hearings will be held otherwise than in public; in other words they will be held in private, except where the woman would like it to be held in public.  This respects the privacy of the women concerned.  I have met many of these women as others here have as well.  The idea of those women having to tell their intimate life stories in a very public fashion is something that has discouraged many from going forward to seek justice and answers.  The idea of having an opportunity to tell their stories in private in a less formal setting is something that we can welcome.  It respects the privacy of the women concerned while giving them the opportunity to have hearings, or part of hearings, in public should they wish.<br\/><br\/>The tribunal will also facilitate restoration of trust meetings.  The intention behind a restoration of trust meeting is to document experiences, facilitate discussion and provide information to the woman concerned or her family.  In addition to these functions, the tribunal may also provide advice or recommendations to the Minister relating to its work.  That is important because we will discuss over the next few days the various views on this Bill.  My starting point, and frankly my finishing point, will be the fact that the judge will have the opportunity to keep in contact with my Department while being fully independent regarding any recommendations that she may wish to make.  That should provide us with a degree of assurance in this House. <br\/><br\/>The Bill is divided into three Parts.  Part 1 is the preliminary and general part, part 2 provides for the CervicalCheck tribunal and part 3 contains miscellaneous provisions.  Section 1 is a standard section on the Short Title and commencement provisions.  Section 2 is the definitions section.  A key definition is the definition of &quot;relevant woman&quot;, which is central to the scope of the tribunal regarding who may make a claim.  These are women identified as part of the review of cervical screening as having had CervicalCheck cytology review findings that were discordant with those of the original cytology examination, or women whose cytology slides were re-examined as part of the retrospective CervicalCheck audit and whose cytology review findings were discordant with those of the original cytology examination.  I brought forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il that extended eligibility to a small additional group of women whose slides could not be located in time for them to be examined as part of the review of cervical screening.<br\/><br\/>I want to let Senators know at this stage that I have committed, and commit again today, to returning to the Oireachtas in the autumn with a proposal to amend the legislation to allow women who declined to participate in the review of cervical screening a further opportunity to be included in the scope of the tribunal.  At the moment, it is possible for a woman in the 221+ group and who has had a discordance, a woman who has gone through the RCOG process and had a discordance, or if it was not possible to go through that process because slides were missing, to have access to the tribunal.  There will be another group of people who have decided, for their own reasons, which we should not second-guess, that they do not wish to be part of any review.  I was asked in the other House if I would consider allowing that group one more opportunity to take part in an independent review and allowing them to access the tribunal if they say &quot;yes&quot; and a discordance is found.  I happily conceded on that point and I will return to the Oireachtas in the autumn in respect of that matter. <br\/><br\/>Section 3 is a standard provision for expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the legislation.  Part 2 contains sections 4 to 36, inclusive.  Sections 4 to 10, inclusive, deal with establishing the tribunal and the tribunal's functions.  Section 4 provides for the establishment day for the tribunal.  I expect to establish the tribunal once the necessary arrangements are in place for it to begin its work.  Section 5 provides for the establishment of the CervicalCheck tribunal.  The tribunal may sit in divisions, it will be independent in the performance of its functions and will regulate its own procedures.  Section 6 is the membership section.  The tribunal will comprise a chairperson and not less than two ordinary members, appointed by me as the Minister for Health.  As has been announced, Ms Justice Mary Irvine will be the chairperson.  I thank her for accepting that role.  The Minister may appoint additional persons to the tribunal, if necessary.  The chairperson must hold or have held judicial office in the superior courts.  Ordinary members must hold or have held judicial office in the superior courts or be a practicing barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years' practice.<br\/><br\/>The tribunal&rsquo;s functions come under section 7.  The tribunal shall hear and determine claims made to it, facilitate restoration of trust meetings and report on and make recommendations as it deems appropriate on any matter relating to its work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Section 8 deals with staff for the tribunal.  Section 9 enables the tribunal to appoint people with expertise to provide it with advice or assistance.  It also enables the tribunal to conduct or commission research, again subject to prior approval from me, as Minister, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 10 allows the tribunal to appoint its own counsel.<br\/><br\/>Sections 11 to 13, inclusive, are concerned with the making of claims to the tribunal.  These are important sections.  Section 11 provides for claims before the tribunal and who may make claims.  A claim may be made by an appropriate person and an appropriate person under the Bill is defined as a relevant woman or, where the woman is deceased, a dependant of the woman.  A claim for compensation may be made seeking damages for negligence, breach of duty, breach of statutory duty or breach of contract arising from any act or omission concerning CervicalCheck.  A claim may also be made seeking damages for the alleged negligence or breach of duty arising from an alleged failure to inform the relevant woman or her dependant of the results of the retrospective CervicalCheck audit.  I have mentioned already the amendments made to this section and my plans in that regard.  It is important to state that the legal principles as to liability and quantum of damages as applied in the High Court in respect of such cases will apply to claims before the tribunal.  A claim may not be made where a person has received an award from any court or settlement in respect of any action arising from any circumstances which could give rise to a claim before the tribunal.  The exception is an award under the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme.<br\/><br\/>Section 12 deals with reckoning of time for the purposes of the Statute of Limitations.  In the case of a woman identified as part of the review of CervicalCheck, a claim must be made within nine months of establishment day for the tribunal or within six months of being notified of findings of the review of cervical screening, whichever is the later.  In the case of other women within the scope of the tribunal, a claim must be made within nine months of the establishment day for the tribunal.  A person may not make claim where the person was entitled to institute proceedings in respect of a relevant claim, and the limitation period in respect of instituting those proceedings has expired.  However, the period beginning on the making of a claim and ending six months from the date on which the tribunal notifies the claimant that one or more of the relevant parties have failed to agree in writing to the claim being determined by the tribunal will be disregarded in reckoning any period for the purpose of limitations.  As initiated, the Bill did not provide for the additional six months.  I was pleased that my amendment to allow for the latter - on which I engaged with the Opposition - was accepted on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il following constructive discussion at the Select Committee on Health.  Similarly, the period beginning on the making of a claim and - following amendment - now ending six months from the date on which the tribunal notified the claimant that one or more of the relevant parties have notified the tribunal that they no longer consent to the claim being determined by the tribunal will also be disregarded in the reckoning of any period for the purpose of limitation periods regarding a claim.<br\/><br\/>Section 13 provides that the tribunal will hear and determine only claims in respect of which there is an agreement in writing from the relevant parties.  The relevant parties are the claimant, the HSE and the cytology laboratory services retained by the HSE for CervicalCheck.<br\/><br\/>Sections 14 to 26, inclusive, provide for claims before the tribunal and procedures.  Section 14 provides for the manner of determination of issues.  The tribunal will hear and determine claims in the same manner as such matters are determined by the High Court in respect of claims for personal injuries.  Section 15 provides for third-party procedures and consent issues.  The tribunal may grant an application to join a third party to a claim in the same manner as such applications are determined by the High Court.  The claim will proceed before the tribunal only where the third party consents to having all issues arising in the claim determined by the tribunal.  Where the third party does not consent to having all issues arising in the claim determined by the tribunal, the tribunal shall not continue to hear and determine the claim.<br\/><br\/>Section 16 requires the tribunal to take into account any sum paid or payable to a claimant under the CervicalCheck non-disclosure <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme when considering whether an award should be made regarding non-disclosure.  Section 17 provides for applicable principles to awards of the tribunal.  An award shall be made on the same basis as an award of the High Court.  A claimant will have 21 days, or such longer period as the tribunal may determine, from the making of the award to accept or reject the award or to appeal the award.  A claimant shall be deemed to have rejected the award where the claimant neither accepts or rejects the award nor appeals the award within the 21-day period or such greater period determined by the tribunal.  Where the claimant decides to accept the award, the acceptance must be made in the prescribed form, which is a notice of acceptance and shall be accompanied by a waiver.  I have committed to considering this provision further over the summer, because some women have raised concern over the concept of a waiver.  The word &quot;waiver&quot; does not sit well with me either but I want to be clear that this provision only applies in a situation where a woman wishes to accept an award.  Should a women be unsatisfied with an award, of course she is not expected to waive the right to take further action.  I will look at the wording of the section.  I am satisfied that the legal principles are sounds.<br\/><br\/>Rules contained in the Civil Liability Acts 1961 to 2017 shall be applied to the tribunal in the same manner as would be applicable in an assessment of damages were proceedings to be brought to the High Court regarding the claim.  Section 18 provides that parties appearing before the tribunal shall be entitled to be legally represented.  Section 19 provides that the tribunal may award costs in respect of a claim.  Under section 20, hearings are generally to be otherwise than in public.  However, a hearing or part of a hearing will be conducted in public where a claimant requests and the tribunal agrees that it would be appropriate to do so.<br\/><br\/>Section 21 provides for the form and manner in which evidence may be given.  Section 22 provides for powers relating to witnesses and documents.  Section 23 provides for privileges and immunities of witnesses.  A person who gives evidence to the tribunal or who produces or sends documents to the tribunal, as directed by it, has the same immunities and privileges in respect of that evidence or those documents, and is subject to the same liabilities, as a witness in proceedings in the High Court.<br\/><br\/>Section 24 provides that the tribunal may apply to the High Court for directions relating to the performance of its functions or for the approval of the court of an act proposed to be done by the tribunal for the purposes of performing its functions.  The High Court may hear an application otherwise than in public having regard to the subject matter or any other matter relating to the nature of the evidence to be given at the hearing of the application.  An important section in the Bill is section 25 which enables the tribunal to determine and adopt pre-claim protocols.  These are procedures governing requirements to be complied with before claims are brought.  That is important.  It is one of the big differences between the court process and the tribunal model.  The aim is to promote timely communication between parties, facilitate early identification of the relevant parties, facilitate early identification of the issue in dispute in respect of a possible claim and facilitate the hearing and determination of claims in a manner which is just and expeditious.  Section 25 also enables the chairperson to issue practice directions on the conduct of claims.<br\/><br\/>Section 26 provides for the tribunal to make rules to regulate practice and procedure and the conduct of claims.  Section 27 provides for appeals.  Section 28 provides for confirmation and publication of the tribunal's determinations.  I was pleased to accept an amendment to this section on Report Stage.  It now provides that confirmation will only be required where an award is accepted.  Section 29 provides for enforcement of awards.<br\/><br\/>Sections 30 to 33, inclusive, have the restoration of trust provisions which I spoke about earlier and I also include provision for a facilitator in regard to the meetings.  Section 31 provides for the appointment of a facilitator to carry on and control generally the administration and business of restoration of trust meetings.  Importantly, the facilitator is independent in the performance of his or her functions.  Section 32 sets out the detail in regard to restoration of trust meetings.  It is important that real, open discussion takes place at those meetings and, accordingly, section 33 provides appropriate protections for participants.  Evidence is not admissible in any court or the tribunal of any information, statement or admission disclosed or made in the course of a restoration of trust meeting.  Information provided by a participant at a restoration of trust meeting will not invalidate professional indemnity insurance policies or contracts of insurance, nor will information provided at the meeting constitute an admission of fault.  In other words, it must be a safe space for trust to be restored.<br\/><br\/>Sections 34 and 35 deal with the tribunal's recommendations and its annual reports.  Under section 34, the tribunal may make recommendations to me as Minister and the Minister will publish any recommendations made by the tribunal to inject transparency.  Section 35 requires the tribunal to prepare and submit the recommendations to the Minister and places an obligation on me to publish them.  Section 36 provides for the dissolution of the tribunal and that the Minister may by order dissolve the tribunal.  That would be done following consultation with the tribunal.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 provides for miscellaneous matters and has sections 37 to 40.  Section 37 provides that where an appeal from a determination of the tribunal is made to the High Court, rules of court may make provision for the hearing and determination of those appeals in a timely and efficient manner.  Section 38 provides for offences and penalties for offences.  Section 39 provides for restriction of the data protection regulation to enable the tribunal, the facilitator and moderators to perform their functions.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is quite technical and it is important to put the information on the record of the House, as it is a Bill that will interest many.  At its heart, what we are trying to do here is provide an alternative pathway to the courts system.  People will always have a constitutional right to go to court.  The Constitution is clear on that, but there is an onus on us to provide as many alternative pathways as possible.  Through the State Claims Agency we have a process of mediation, which has settled a number of claims, including some high-profile ones.  We have the courts system in its constitutional place.  We have an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme for non-disclosure, where the State has said for the issue of non-disclosure we accept liability and an independent panel has agreed the figure of &euro;20,000 to be paid out in that regard where non-disclosure took place, or not appropriate disclosure.  The CervicalCheck tribunal is another alternative pathway.  Is it perfect?  Absolutely not.  Is there a perfect model?  Absolutely not.  We are trying to do here something we have never done before.  People hear the word &quot;tribunal&quot; and they think of the Mahon tribunal.  That was a tribunal of investigation, this is not.  We had Dr. Scally do his work.  People also think of the hepatitis C tribunal.  That was a compensation tribunal, this is not.  In that case, it was quite straightforward - people had been injected with contaminated blood that did them serious damage and the State needed to care for and compensate them.  In this instance, we know, because of the limitations of screening, that there will have been false negatives and false positives in some cases and that there was negligence.  Where there was negligence, women have a right to have that determined.  We want them to have it determined, if they so wish, in an alternative place to the High Court.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an adjudicative tribunal and liability does have to be determined.  We have been at this now for many months, trying to find the best and most compassionate way to do it.  Greater minds than mine have looked at it.  Mr. Justice Charles Meenan, one of the most eminent clinical negligence judges in the country, examined it in great detail.  On page 20 of his report he published ten reasons it would operate better than the court system.  For me, as a layperson, at its heart is that it can be done in private and people can submit written statements, which lessens the need to go and tell their whole story, unless they wish to do so.  There are pre-action protocols; the judge can appoint her own experts and, where liability is not contested, the process can be fast-tracked.  There are a number of ways in which it is less adversarial.  However, it is not entirely so as there has to be that ability to adjudicate on and determine the issues of liability and negligence.  I am happy that, after significant engagement by the judge with Dr. Scally, patient advocates, the State Claims Agency and the laboratories, this is the best model we can put in place.  It is just one of a number of pathways we are trying to provide as alternatives to court.<\/p><p>I thank the House for taking the Bill as speedily as it has and hope we can endeavour to pass it in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#O02100","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his work in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#R00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for coming to the House to introduce the Bill.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, for attending to deal with it.  <\/p> <p>This is welcome legislation.  We have the report from Mr. Justice Meenan which recommends the setting up of a tribunal and deals with how it is to be established and operated.  We have appointed the chairperson of the tribunal, Ms Justice Mary Irvine, who has huge experience in dealing with difficult issues and cases.  It is important that we deal with cases in a proper manner.  The issue for many people who want to bring claims is that they want to bring them privately, but they will also have the option, if they want all or part of the hearing to be held in public, to make that application.<\/p> <p>It is important that we give recognition to the work of Dr. Gabriel Scally in the reports he has produced and identifying a number of issues which had not been disclosed at an early stage, in particular, the number of laboratories to which work had been subcontracted out.  Even CervicalCheck appeared not to have been aware of the subcontracting that was taking place.<\/p> <p>In dealing with the Bill it is important that we also give recognition to the amount of work that has been done on cervical screening and the number of lives that have been saved.  What occurred was that women who had gone through the screening process and been told that they had no abnormalities were within a period of time identified with cancer.  It was for them CervicalCheck decided to carry out an audit to see whether the cancer could have been identified at an earlier date.  It turned out that 221 cases were identified where inaccurate readings had been furnished to the clinicians and patients.  A a result, we are left with the difficulty of dealing with this issue where inaccurate information was furnished and patients were given a false sense of security.<\/p> <p>When patients became aware that their cancer could have been identified and treated at an earlier stage, it caused huge difficulties in trying to deal with it, not only for themselves but also for their immediate families.  In some cases, the results of the audit were not furnished to the patients, while in others the results were only furnished after the patient had died.  It is appropriate, therefore, that we set up a proper structure to deal with these cases, particularly because the patients have gone through huge trauma in being diagnosed with cancer and going through the treatment process.  Every one of us in the House has some relation, family member or close acquaintance who has received treatment for cancer, whether it be cervical cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer or otherwise.  It causes huge trauma for both the patient and immediate family members.  The one thing we need to do is to try to lessen that trauma by making sure the process made available to deal with the issue of the compensation that should be awarded does not involve an additional traumatic experience for them.  Thus, the recommendation of Mr. Justice Meenan was that a tribunal be set up.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise that there must be agreement by both the HSE and the cytology laboratories that they will participate in the tribunal.  It is important that there be agreement on participating to make sure all parties will be involved.<\/p> <p>This is welcome legislation, something we need to put in place.  The issue that still has to be dealt is the decision of Mr. Justice Kevin Cross in the High Court in the context of &ldquo;absolute confidence&rdquo;.  That matter still has to go before the Supreme Court and needs to be clarified.  Overall, the Minister has adopted the right approach and accepted the recommendation of Mr. Justice Meenan to set up a tribunal.  The legislation is comprehensive and deals with all aspects of the matter.  It also deals with the availability of an appeals process and ensures there can be directions by the tribunal and recommendations to the Minister from it, which is welcome.  It is important that we pass the legislation and set up the tribunal.  We have appointed a chairperson and need to appoint a further two persons to it in order that it can get on with its work at the earliest possible date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#R00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  I wish we had extra time, especially given the extremely tight turnaround time between Second Stage and all other Stages which are due to be taken tomorrow.  That barely gives the House enough time to draw breath, let alone consider amendments.  However, as I would prefer to see the Bill passed in some form, rather than not, I welcome it.<\/p> <p>The entire country was deeply affected and impressed by the bravery of all the women who came forward during the CervicalCheck scandal.  They were and are warriors for women and the country.  I remember, in particular, the beautiful woman that was Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a h-anam.

Listening to the debates on this legislation in the D&aacute;il, it is widely acknowledged and accepted that women should not have to go to court again for the claims arising from the acts or omissions of CervicalCheck.  They have been through enough.  It is vitally important to continue to listen to women throughout this process.  They are experts by experience, unfortunately.<\/p><p>The legislation sets out the limitations of the tribunal and the mechanisms for it to do its work.  It has to continue to include the women affected and to be efficient and compassionate, and it has to include as many women as possible.  It reminds me of the HSE steering committee on children with complex medical needs, which we discussed last year.  We had to fight to get parents included in the work of that steering committee.  We got this House to agree, by way of a motion, that the parents of those children were experts by experience.  The same principle applies here.  The women involved are the experts and, while the Minister acknowledges this, it is important to make the point again and again.  They are at the epicentre of this situation and we will always need to be mindful of them and their experiences.  Sinn F&eacute;in stated in the D&aacute;il that it does not wish to delay this Bill in any way.  We want it to be the best it can be and the Minister has been working with all sides as the legislation progresses.  We agreed not to table amendments in the D&aacute;il on condition that the Minister took seriously our concerns and we are willing to do the same here. <\/p><p>In reference to the tribunal itself, it is important that it hears and determines all issues of negligence, breaches of duty, including statutory duty, breaches of contract and any other matters that should arise.  I am glad there will be an opportunity to hold hearings in public or in private.  We must be prepared for the fact that some of what we will hear in public will make for uncomfortable listening.  It is important for the women to say it and for us to hear it and try to understand and act on it.  As this scandal came into the public arena over the last year, it made for heartbreaking listening and it was often infuriating to hear of the failures of the State to those women.  With scandal upon scandal exposed, it was like the opening of a Pandora's box.  I hope the passing of this Bill brings at least some relief, although we know the damage cannot be undone.  It is welcome that the tribunal will have the power to compel witnesses and the production of documentation.  At some stage last year, Dr. Scally found it difficult, to say the least, to get documentation in an orderly and timely fashion.  It is extremely important that we have the power to compel witnesses and documentation for the sake of transparency, accountability and accessibility.  I note that the tribunal can make recommendations to the Minister.  In that regard, there is space for a mechanism for hearing from a broader range of opinions.  <\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in raised a concern during the D&aacute;il debates around the exclusion of those who have previously received an award from giving evidence.  While I understand the rationale, I wonder if we might miss some information or evidence that should be included in the feedback from the tribunal to the Minister.  This should be taken on board and consideration should be given to how those women can be included.  It is important that all those affected should have the opportunity to give evidence to the tribunal.  We need every woman's story and journey included in the feedback.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, could address this in her reply.<\/p><p>As I stated, I wish we had more time to scrutinise this important Bill.  However, it is welcome that it is being addressed before the summer recess because time is precious to the women in question.  The Minister made reference to the HPV vaccine.  I ask those tinfoil hat Neanderthals to cease propagating fear among people who take their news mainly from social media.  We deal with science and facts.  We spoke with the Minister yesterday about the expansion of the heel prick test, done on newborn babies, to include 40 tests.  Some 99.9% of new parents avail of this although it is not mandatory because they know its intrinsic worth.  We want to get to that figure in respect of girls taking up the HPV vaccine.  It is essential for the future eradication of cervical cancer.  While take-up of the vaccine is increasing, I suggest we could do more in the way of advertisement.  It would honour those we have lost to cervical cancer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#R00400","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>This is a very important tribunal for the women who have been affected and their families.  It is also important for Ireland.  Dr. Scally spoke about the lack of grace and compassion in how Ireland had engaged with the controversy.  While financial remedy may be part of the solution, it does not do the job fully in terms of addressing what we need to address.  Dr. Scally also spoke of a culture in which women were often disempowered or silenced within our health system.  We have seen that in many other areas of the health system again and again.<\/p> <p>While we want to pass this legislation before the summer and move forward with the tribunal, I have a couple of key questions on which I hope the Minister of State might be able to give us assurance.  The point made by Senator Devine is most appropriate.  The fact that somebody has received an award does not mean her experience or insight is no longer relevant.  The fact that we may have given some kind of small compensation, which can never compensate for what families have experienced, does not mean that is the end of the State's job in rebuilding trust and relationships or in repairing our health system.  It is foolish to place any constraint on those who have received an award being able to give evidence.  The extraordinary generosity of voice of the women who have experienced this failure in our screening process, who have suffered and some of whom, as in the case of Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, have lost their lives, has been remarked upon internationally.  I refer also to people like Vicky Phelan who continue to be incredible advocates.  In moving past their own traumas, these women have sought to talk about what Ireland should be.  It has been crucial in respect of the HPV vaccine, which is crucial for preventing future cases of cervical cancer and which is often under attack in many parts of the world.  I am an executive member of the European parliamentary forum on sexual and reproductive rights, where members have described the campaigns against the HPV vaccine.  Those women have extraordinary generosity in championing the vaccine.  They worked with schoolgirls in Kilkenny recently to produce projects about it and highlight it.  Those voices are incredibly powerful and important.  My only real concern about this tribunal is that we do not inadvertently silence the voices of women who have experienced this.  I ask for this aspect to be reviewed.<\/p> <p>I may put forward an amendment to section 20.  We often talk about the concern for privacy in Ireland but we can sometimes be excessive.  We must ask which privacy we are protecting, and if we are really seeking to avoid State embarrassment.  The Bill provides that the tribunal shall conduct its hearings otherwise than in public, which I presume means in private.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Section 20(2) states: \"Where a claimant requests the Tribunal to hold a hearing or part of a hearing in public and the Tribunal agrees that it would be appropriate to do so ...\".  That is my concern.  If a claimant says they wish to have their hearing, or part of their hearing, held in public, we should not be in a position where the tribunal denies them that right to have their case heard in public.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to assure me that it will never be the intention of the tribunal to deny women the right to have their stories told in public because I see the legislation allows for the tribunal to deny a request from a claimant to have their story told in public.  I hope this can be addressed procedurally but I may table an amendment on for tomorrow.<\/p><p>On the terms of the recommendations, the importance of rolling out the HIP vaccine and Ireland giving leadership on that issue internationally and, through our aid programmes, supporting access to HIP vaccine for women and girls worldwide has been touched on.  The learning and the recommendations may be of global benefit but another area where I believe recommendations may be, and I hope will be, made by the tribunal is in respect of our public procurement process.  I brought forward legislation on public procurement some months ago in this House and specifically on the issues of price quality versus lowest cost.  We know that in respect of the cervical screening programme it was a lowest cost tender.  We know the State has and should have the opportunity to insist that both price and quality, the price-quality option, are considered.  That is an option within European legislation.  The Bill I put forward would make it a default option in that unless a Department can justify an exception, price and quality, and a consideration of quality, would be involved in every public tender.  In the areas of health that is all the more crucial.  We should never be in a position whereby if there is a question mark around quality in respect of any company it is able to jump the queue because it comes in with a lower bid.  That is a concern.  I hope that is a learning we have collectively in terms of future screening and future health services in our country.  The Minister might give an indication as to the scope and range of the recommendations the tribunal may give to the Minister and how those issue are to be addressed in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#S00200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I do not think we will ever forget the reaction in this House, the other House and among the public at large when this scandal first emerged last year.  My first reaction, and that of many of my friends, was that that could have been my wife, my sister or my friend.  It turned out that many of us in these Houses have friends who have been affected and who are among those 221 women affected, and they have been dealing with very difficult sets of circumstances in the past few years.<\/p> <p>It goes without saying that this is a very important Bill.  My colleague, Deputy Kelly, has led the way in working with many of the women who were so badly affected and badly treated in terms of the cervical check situation.  He has considerable experience on this issue, more than I have.  As we know, he has developed very close personal relationships with many of the women who have been affected, particularly women like Vicky Phelan, who have inspired us all in the past year or more since this scandal was first brought to public attention.  The women concerned have behaved so selflessly in telling their own stories and advocating, not just for themselves but for other women, for improvements to our health service and to the culture in terms of how we deal with situations like this in our country.<\/p> <p>I do not intend to use all the time available to me to speak about the legislation necessarily but it is important to state that we need to get to a position where lessons are learned and applied by the this country's bureaucracy and the political system.  When a scandal of this nature and scale emerges, we have a terrible tendency to circle the wagons and protect the system.<\/p> <p>Looking at the legislation, it is important that we recognise some very important developments.  The provision of a mechanism for what is called restoration of trust meetings is very important.  That can lead to a culture change in terms of how we do things in this country.  It is very important that the women affected get the opportunity to air their concerns in a supportive environment and believe that not only are they being listened to but that they are being heard as well and that their experiences can and will change how we do things in this country.<\/p> <p>I note from the Minister's remarks on one or two Committee Stage amendments that he will be extending eligibility in circumstances where slides may be missing.  That is a good idea and an important measure.  I welcome also that is has been established in the legislation that a dependant of a deceased claimant may make a claim on behalf of the deceased.  It is important to clarify that also, and that there is reassurance for families because we are dealing with women who in many cases are gravely ill and, in all too many difficult cases, are terminally ill.<\/p> <p>This is an alternative to the adversarial court processes.  I understand and appreciate that this is an adjudicatory process and one that seeks to establish liability and negligence.  The Minister will say, with the best will in the world, that these fora are, almost by definition, adversarial, although perhaps not as adversarial as High Court proceedings and the like.  In so far as we possibly can, we need to avoid damaging women going through these excessively adversarial processes.  These women have been through enough and this system needs to be supportive and understand the position in which they find themselves.  I hope that the tribunal staff, the Chair and others are mindful of that and the requirement to be very sensitive and supportive of the women who will be going through this process.<\/p> <p>I have a key question for the Minister of State and I hope she is in a position to answer it.  An amendment was tabled by my colleague, Deputy Kelly, in recent days which focused on the need to allow claimants to go back to the tribunal in the event of a recurrence or a relapse but the amendment was not accepted.  My understanding is that it was initially ruled out of order.  That is disgraceful.  My understanding is that the hepatitis C tribunal provided for the opportunity for individuals to go back to the tribunal.  We know only too well, in the context of cancers, that relapses sometimes occur after a period of remission.  How does the Minister intend to deal with these all-too-human occurrences of relapses and recurrences of cancers?  If not in this legislation, how does her senior colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, intend to deal with that?  To quote from the RT&Eacute; website and not directly from the Official Report of recent nights when Committee and Report Stages were taken, the Minister, Deputy Harris, appears to have stated that if cancer returns, \"[t]here is nothing to stop a woman [taking] a new cause of action to the court[s]\".  Surely this is about avoiding the use of the courts to settle cases like this and to establish negligence if and when it occurred and establish liability.  Surely the best way to do this is through the tribunal and not through the courts.  I am concerned that the Minister said in the D&aacute;il in recent days that if cancer returned there was nothing to stop a woman taking a new cause of action to the courts.  The amendment tabled by my colleague, Deputy Kelly, failed in the D&aacute;il but we, the Labour Party group, intend to reintroduce it in the Seanad and have this debate on Committee Stage, and potentially Report Stage also, if it is not accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#T00200","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions and overall support for the CervicalCheck Tribunal Bill 2019.  The Minister of Health, Deputy Harris, and I have listened carefully to the Senators.  We will consider with our officials the points raised in the House this afternoon.<\/p> <p>The central purpose of the Bill is to implement the recommendation of Mr. Justice Meenan on an alternative scheme for dealing with claims arising from CervicalCheck.  The tribunal is fundamentally different in character to tribunals of inquiry, with which we have become familiar.  It will determine liability in respect of claims subject to the consent of all parties.  It will make awards in line with the principles governing awards in the High Court.  The new process will have significant benefits for those wishing to claim by adopting a pre-claim protocol and practice direction that will make hearings move more quickly.  The tribunal will of course uphold the principle of justice and will only make findings of negligence when the evidence considered to the High Court standard warrants such findings.  These findings will be subject to High Court confirmation and can be appealed to the High Court and, thereafter, to the Court of Appeal on a point of law.  The tribunal hearings will be held in private except when the claimants request otherwise and the tribunal agrees.  This respects the privacy of the women concerned while ensuring they are empowered to go public if they so wish.<\/p> <p>The tribunal is a key part of our collective response to the CervicalCheck cases.  Enacting the Bill sends the message that we are listening to the concerns expressed by women who have taken cases to the court.  We have acted to provide an alternative solution.<\/p> <p>As the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has said, an important feature of the tribunal that distinguishes it from court practice and procedure is that the tribunal Bill provides for an independent facilitator who will convene restoration of trust meetings between women and their clinicians.  This facilitator will operate independent of the tribunal, the Government and the HSE.  The facilitator will provide for the experiences of women to be heard and they will be able to engage meaningfully with clinicians in a safe environment.  This function will be available regardless of whether the woman chooses to take a case to the tribunal or the courts.  It will also be available to women whose cases have already concluded where trust in medicine, the screening programme or the State has been damaged.  It is vital that we take steps to rebuild this trust.<\/p> <p>As the Minister, Deputy Harris, mentioned, we will return in the autumn to expand the scope of the tribunal to a particular additional cohort of women.  The Minister will also consider the points made today over the summer.  The Minister looks forward to working more with the House and Departments in moving forward on implementation and the recommendations of Dr. Scally, including the move to primary human papilloma virus, HPV, screening and the enactment of a patient safety Bill, which will provide in law for mandatory open disclosure in respect of serious patient safety instances.  The Minister is open to working with Members on ways we can protect the well-being of vulnerable service users and their families.  We believe that the tribunal will make the difficult process somewhat easier.<\/p> <p>I thank Members, the Ceann Comhairle and officials of the Bills Office, whom I know worked late into the night to have the Bill published.  The hard work that has been put into developing this legislation is only beginning.  After the Houses have finished their work for the time being, the Minister has tasked officials with beginning work on the implementation of the tribunal as an absolute priority.  I wish to assure Members and women who may be listening that the work will not stop or slow down after this afternoon but will continue.  I thank the House once again for its consideration and input.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer to one or two things.

Senator Devine should note that women who have already received an award can make use of the restoration of trust meetings.  Such women will be encouraged.  Their experiences should be recorded and section 32 sets out the details in this regard.  I agree with the Senator on the importance of their voices being heard.  Senator Higgins has given me an opportunity to highlight the work of the steering group on CervicalCheck, which includes women and family members who were part of the process.  I wish to thank them on behalf of all of us.  Reference was made to hearings in public.  There is absolutely no intention to deny the right of women to have their hearing held in public.  The requirements of the tribunal on public hearings are purely procedural.  They are required to ensure women will indicate in advance whether they want to be heard publically.<\/p> <p>I am conscious of the fact that I may not have been able to answer one or two other questions.  However, I assure Senators that from listening to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in recent days and especially his commitment in the D&aacute;il yesterday I am confident we have a Minister who is more than compassionate.  The Minister is in the right place and will do everything to rectify the damage done to so many women.<\/p> <p>I am conscious of the fact that I may not be able to answer some of the questions.  I was directed here from the D&aacute;il some minutes ago.  In dressing myself this morning I was conscious of the fact that I put on a jacket.  It is only as I sit here that I realise I am wearing a CervicalCheck pin.  This is an indication of what has been said here, especially by Senator Devine, about the HPV vaccine.  As public representatives we know how important it is to instil in young people the importance of having the HPV vaccine.  I sat on the Joint Committee on Health a long time ago along with several people in the Chamber.  I remember the time we met women and mothers who had concerns around some of the vaccines.  I have been looking at the evidence from Australia recently - I imagine many people have seen it - and the number of women there suffering from cervical cancer has almost gone off the map altogether.  We will all have a role to play over the coming months to promote the HPV vaccine and all the other vaccines that are so essential to our children and the health of all of us in this country.  I hope that helps some of the Senators.  I know there is another session and Senators may be able to raise issues then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#U00500","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister of State, for your compassionate and understanding voice, as always, on matters such as this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#U00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562837400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#U00850","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#U00925","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562837400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Friday, 12 July 2019.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Parole Bill 2016: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1562837400,"counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#V00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562837400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562837400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562837400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 2 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I would like to make a brief point on section 2.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish to say, as I did on Second Stage, how much I welcome the Bill on behalf of Labour Senators, although I regret that it is being rushed through so swiftly.  I did not table amendments because the D&aacute;il will not be sitting tomorrow and will therefore be unable to accept any Seanad amendments, but I will support the amendments tabled by my colleague, Senator Ruane.  I have a number of points to raise regarding specific sections of the Bill and, given that we cannot address them this week due to time constraints, I hope they will addressed at a future date if necessary.<\/p> <p>One of these points relates to two aspects of section 2(1) of the Bill, which I will raise now and then raise again in the context of later sections.  Section 2(1) comprises definitions or interpretations.  Section 2(1) defines a \"legal representative\" as \"a practising solicitor or a practising barrister\".  I am grateful to my fellow barrister and colleague, Tony McGillicuddy, for raising with me in a personal capacity an issue arising from that definition.  He points out that, given that the definition refers to a practising solicitor or a practising barrister, it is unclear whether later references to legal representatives in the Bill preclude the appointment of a barrister and a solicitor to represent a parolee where that is required.  To explain this issue in more detail, the Bill allows for legal representation at parole hearings by a legal representative as defined in section 2(1), which is very welcome.  There is also provision in section 14 for legal aid to be provided for the legal representative.  The issue I am raising, and on which I seek clarity from the Minister of State, is whether \"legal representative\" should be read to mean either a barrister or a solicitor or whether it might be possible for victims to be represented by both in some cases, as is generally the case in contentious matters.  Parole hearings might be said not to be contentious, but clearly they could be.  This should really be clarified.  <\/p> <p>The specific provision to which I am referring is section 14(1), which again makes reference to legal representatives.  This reference is made in the context of the application.  The section is titled \"Procedures of Board\".  Section 14(1)(a) refers to the granting of legal aid.  Sections 14(1)(c) and 14(1)(d) enable the relevant person and his or her legal representative to attend a meeting with the board.  Later in the Bill there are provisions allowing persons seeking parole to apply on their own behalf.  I seek clarity as to whether it is possible for legal representatives to make applications on their behalf.  Again I am grateful to Tony McGillicuddy for pointing this out.  There seems to be a discrepancy between section 31 of the Bill and section 26(3).  Section 31(2) enables an application to be made by a person or on his or her behalf to vary a parole order whereas section 26(3), which refers to applications for parole, does not make express provision for applications to made on behalf of a person.  This seems somewhat anomalous given that legal representation is, rightly, provided for.  <\/p> <p>I have raised the issue of whether \"legal representative\" must be read as a single representative or whether it could include both a solicitor and a barrister where necessary but there is also the issue of whether applications can be made by a lawyer on behalf of a parolee.  There might be particular cases in which people would want their lawyer to make the application on their behalf, as they are empowered to do under section 31 in the case of applications to vary parole orders.  I have made a number of points.  They relate to different provisions of the Bill but, as section 2(1) contains the definition of \"legal representative\", now seemed a good time to raise them.  <\/p> <p>Another issue, which I will raise later and which I raised on Second Stage, is the issue of whether the definition of \"parolee\" includes a child who has been sentenced to life.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has rightly raised concern about the 12-year minimum, which it believes is too high a bar for a child serving a life sentence.  I will raise that issue again when we come to section 24 as that is the more appropriate place to discuss it but I looked again at section 2 and there is no distinction made in the definitions in respect of parolees who are minors.  An amendment could have been tabled in that respect had this Bill not been rushed through at this late stage.  I welcome the Bill and I will not stand in its way.  I am just putting down markers as to issues that could have been dealt with better had we had a little more time to deal with the Bill, given that three years have now passed since it was first introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#V00500","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>On that point, I am advised that it is intended that applicants can be represented by both a barrister and a solicitor.

The subsection proposed in my amendment effectively requires positive approval by both Houses of any regulation made under section 24 fixing the minimum proportion of a non-life sentence which must be served.  The present version of section 4 merely allows either House to veto any such regulation.  In my amendment I am suggesting that the Minister would have to positively justify such regulation to the satisfaction of both Houses in order to make the regulation effective.  The Bill as presently drafted assumes that each House will acquiesce.  In other words, the regulations are a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  Should my amendment pass, the House would have a chance to probe and scrutinise the Minister on the rationale underpinning his proposals.  This is very simple but very important and I would like this to be considered.  The Oireachtas should consider the Minister's regulations before they become law instead of them automatically becoming law whenever the Minister published them with the only possibility of overturning them being if either House of the Oireachtas passed a motion annulling them, as would happen under the law as currently designed.  The passing of such a motion is an exceptionally rare event.  I do not believe it has ever occurred under any other legislation containing similar provisions.

Section 4 deals with the Minister's powers to make regulations under the Act.  Section 4(3), which, as the Senator has already pointed out, is a standard provision in legislation, provides that if the Minister wants to use any power to make regulations under the Act, he must lay a copy of that regulation before each House and that, if either House is not happy with the regulation, it can annul them by resolution.  Each House has 21 sitting days to do so.

In this case the Minister believes it is unnecessary because the provision already under section 4 is sufficient and the power to annul provided there already fulfils the requirement.<\/p><p>It also unclear whether regulations made under section 24, and therefore covered by the new subsection proposed in amendment No. 1, would also be covered by the existing section 4(3), potentially resulting in an absurd situation in which both provisions apply at the same time and a lack of clarity as to which, if any, would prevail.

I welcome the Bill and the fact that our parole system will soon be placed on a strong statutory footing.  Parole is an absolutely fundamental and necessary part of the rehabilitative nature of our criminal justice system.  I welcome the work done in this area by Deputy O'Callaghan and the fact that the Bill has been accepted and brought through the Houses by the Government.<\/p><p>Section 12 sets out the provisions relating to the resignation, removal and disqualification from, and ineligibility for, the Parole Board to be established on a statutory footing by the Bill.  The Parole Board is the body that will be given responsibility to adjudicate on parole applications.  It is the beating heart of this legislation and the main means by which its rehabilitative aims will be realised and implemented.  Therefore, the membership and shared competencies and experiences of the board are a crucial balance to get right to ensure this system works well and fairly for those applying for parole.  I note the obvious work done in section 10, which sets out detailed provisions on membership, the bodies that will nominate members, etc.  I am concerned, however, by the provision in section 12 relating to the disqualification of members, in particular by subsection 4, which states that anyone who is convicted of an offence will be disqualified, with no opportunity to appeal or recourse to challenge that decision.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State will be aware, I have a keen interest in the issue of spent convictions and criminal record disclosures and I have legislation in this regard pending before the Houses.  My view is that a provision relating to someone's suitability for a role such as this in the context of his or her criminal record must have regard to his or her individual circumstances, proportionality and a recognition of the value of someone with experience of a conviction to this parole process.  This is the spirt in which I have tabled this amendment.  It is a near identical provision to section 55 of the Charities Act 2009, which allows for someone with a criminal record to apply to become a member of a charity board through the High Court if it is deemed in the public interest.  For example, if a former offender wished to serve on the board of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, it would obviously be in the public interest to have someone with that experience on the board considering the work it does.  I therefore ask simply that the same provision be made in this Bill.  Arguably, the need for diverse experiences within the criminal justice system is even greater than the need for such experiences on the board of a charity.  The amendment would allow someone with a conviction to apply to the High Court for an order to serve on the Parole Board if deemed in the public interest.  I would like this parole adjudication process to be fully inclusive and I do not want the disproportionate blanket ban contained in subsection (4) to act as a barrier to the contribution of valuable experiences to this process.  I hope the Minister can accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#X00900","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I express my strong support for the amendment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a very important one.  It makes sense to ensure there is a mechanism for persons with certain convictions to seek High Court permission to serve on the parole board.<\/p><p>Support for the amendment is present in the current wording of section 12(4), which only disqualifies people in respect of certain convictions, for example, convictions on indictment, convictions involving fraud or dishonesty, or certain declarations or disqualifications under the Companies Act.  Obviously, somebody who has a summary conviction which is not for an offence of fraud or dishonesty is eligible to be on the board.  It makes no sense to me that certain convicted persons can apply and can be members but others cannot.<\/p><p>When we are thinking about the functions of the parole board, dealing in the first instance with persons sentenced to life and, potentially, with persons sentenced to lengthy sentences of eight years or more, patently, people who have been convicted on indictment of more serious offences should be the people who are serving on boards.  If we are agreeing to the principle that persons convicted of certain offences are eligible, surely those convicted of offences for which a lengthier sentence is likely are going to be more important on the board.<\/p><p>I note that the Irish Penal Reform Trust has suggested this amendment.  It states it believes the relevance, gravity or seriousness of length of time since an offence was committed must be considered in any assessment of conviction history.  This sort of blanket ban on certain convictions, as Senator Ruane has said, is not proportionate and, indeed, lies counter to the stated functions and purpose of the parole board.<\/p><p>I stress my support for the legislation.  However, this would be a beneficial amendment to make.  If we cannot make it, given the unfortunate shortness of time we have to debate this, the fact we are taking all Stages today and the fact the D&aacute;il is not sitting tomorrow, perhaps we can come back at a later date and amend the legislation.  There are a number of ways it could be improved and this is clearly one of them.<\/p><p>Senator Ruane mentioned the issue of appeal.  Of course, a difficulty with the Bill as currently drafted is that it no longer has provision for appeal against the decision not to grant parole, as Deputy Jim O'Callaghan&rsquo;s Bill did in its original inception.  That is another procedural issue that could perhaps be dealt with in a different way.  All of us have acknowledged Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s immense contribution in putting his Bill forward, but Second Stage was taken in the D&aacute;il in June 2016, which is more than three years ago.  It is unfortunate we have been given such a tight timeframe within which to debate the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#X01000","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Ruane and Black for tabling the amendments.  As has been stated, section 12 deals with the circumstances where members of the board are to be removed, disqualified or become ineligible to hold office.  Subsection (4) of section 12 provides that a member of the board ceases to be qualified and ceases to be a member of the board if that person is convicted on indictment of an offence or of a fraud or dishonesty offence, or has a declaration or disqualification under the Companies Act made against them.  The amendment seeks to give the High Court the power, where a person disqualified by this section applies to the court, to override the section and make an order that the person may be appointed to the board while leaving the section itself in force.<\/p> <p>Subsection (4) is standard in this kind of Bill.  It does not disqualify every person who has committed any offence whatsoever, as Senator Bacik said.  It is limited to those who are convicted on indictment and those convicted of fraud and dishonesty offences.  I am sure we all agree that honesty and integrity are essential for persons who are to be making these kinds of decisions.  Of course, the High Court does not and should not have a role in appointing persons to State boards, except of course in circumstances where the court already has the power to review a decision of the Minister on such an appointment where it finds it has been arrived at arbitrarily or unfairly.<\/p> <p>I am satisfied that subsection (4) is proportionate.  Of course, as Senator Bacik said, we must always keep legislation under review.  If, in time, a clear problem identifies itself and, for instance, this provision is demonstrably precluding suitable persons from being appointed, then we can look at it and consider whether any future legislative reform might be needed.  I know the matter of spent convictions is one close Senator Ruane&rsquo;s heart, and I commend her on that.  We did a lot of work on that in the justice committee when I was a member.  However, these matters are being looked at separately.<\/p> <p>I am of the view that this amendment is not necessary or wise at this time.  I would ask the House, therefore, not to support it.

I am very much in favour of the Bill, aspects of which are excellent.  I have grave concerns about one matter, namely, the fact that version of the Bill introduced in 2016 became the subject of political theft last week.  Fianna F&aacute;il Senators know that the version before us is completely different from the version Deputy O'Callaghan originally brought forward.<\/p><p>There was a provision to give the court discretion to decide on a set tariff that must be served before parole can be considered for the offence of murder and only murder.  That is what it was - no more and no less.  I do not agree with covering eligibility for parole that has been radically altered.  Section 24, if not quite gone, is certainly unrecognisable.  It has been rewritten extremely badly because much of it cannot be understood.<\/p><p>The most serious section of the Bill, as I read it a week ago, has been erased.  The omitted section stated, &quot;When imposing sentence upon a person, a sentencing judge may impose a specified period during which that person shall not be eligible for parole&quot; in respect of first degree murder, which I accept is a filmic term.  That has been eradicated - magicked away.  I was led to believe that what I am seeking to do via my Criminal Justice (Judicial Discretion) (Amendment Bill) would be somewhat dealt with in this Parole Bill.  Representatives of the Irish Penal Reform Trust informed me with great glee that this section had been deleted while they were lobbying for their amendments.  They indicated that we must make communities safer and use prisons sparingly.  They believe in early prison release.  They believe that all aspects of parole should be transparent, fair and coherent.  I also believe that.  Political cowardice has won the day, however, by virtue of the galloping hordes of those with offender anxiety of biblical proportions - not offenders themselves, with whom I have worked through the years - who stand up for those barbarians who ruined families and communities by committing murder.<\/p><p>The net effect of this recent legislative evisceration is simple.  If we accept the Bill as it stands, whereby a court may under no circumstances hand down or even recommend a set tariff to be served with a mandatory life framework, we are saying that our judges should have no discretion within the life framework when it comes to the most heinous of crimes.  The political effect of the theft of this simple but effective section by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, which has acquiesced, means that we have now given legislative <i>imprimatur<\/i>to a transfer of what is a blindingly obvious judicial function, sentencing, into the hands of the Parole Board.  Sentencing should be transparent fair and coherent; it is not.  When it comes to murder, it is uncertain.  The offence of murder requires a life sentence, but it does not mean life.  I was asking that, when handing down a sentence, a judge may impose a specified period during which the person involved shall not be eligible for parole.  That was all I was saying in respect of murder - wilful, powerful, violent, purposeful murder.<\/p><p>Fine Gael is afraid of making real and genuine decisions and is influenced by quangos.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust is trying to tell it and me what to do.  Sociologists are trying to tell me and everybody else what to do.  Academics are writing papers telling me and everybody else what to do.  In the end, bravery gets lost.  Fianna F&aacute;il is worse.  Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill is now unrecognisable.  They were jumping up and down praising it.  If I were to ask Fianna F&aacute;il Senators if they could tell me the difference between Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill as it came to the House and the Bill as it stands today, I bet they would not pass that exam.<\/p><p>The Parole Board is to become a Minister in the form of a committee.  The Minister has no power, no hand, act or part.  His role is over and our role has been taken away.  It is the handover to the executive.  It is happening everywhere with individual voices getting lost.  The representatives of the Irish Penal Reform Trust campaigned for the implementation of a statutory parole system, fully independent of political control and they have got their way.  They should be here; they are now at ministerial level.  No one here is responsible.  No Minister is responsible anymore.  The executive, the Parole Board, is now responsible for everything to do with release.  The buck stops with it and we all know what happens when committees are in charge.  When an executive is in charge there is no baseline responsibility.  I know the answer - the Parole Board is now a kind of government in itself.  The board is the military wing of the entity seeking to bring about this legislative coup and the Irish Penal Reform Trust is surely its political master.  There is no corner of mindless liberality to which this organisation will not go to ensure offender-led justice.  Are we now saying that the offenders are running the system and the victims are to be left hurling from the ditch?  That seems to be what is happening.  Are the great voices to be silenced?  Executives do not get blamed.  They are the system and the system is never wrong and always offers a place to hide.<\/p><p>What of the victims?  I have met hundreds of family members of victims of murder.  Those children, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters outlined how their lives had been impacted upon, their feelings and the internal eternal damage caused by the deaths of their sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles.  However, the Irish Penal Reform Trust is very concerned about the potential impact of victim input on parole outcomes.  It has stated, &quot;Where submissions by victims are permitted, the legislation should provide for what can be included.&quot;<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Bacik, who was involved in developing victim impact statements, should look carefully at that.<\/p><p>Who thought it was a good idea to get rid of my section in the Bill?  Who believes it is right to ignore the victims of murder, or that a judge should not be allowed impose a specified period during which a person shall not be eligible for parole?  This Bill, in its current state, shows that our judicial system is based purely on reform, rather than punishment of any kind.  One is told there is something wrong with them if they mention punishment.  Judges are not even allowed suggest a specified period without parole, even for the gravest crime of the willful, violent taking of a life.  Even when I argue like this, people do not believe me.  I was an educationalist all my life, and I believe totally in rehabilitation and change.  I have atoned for my own sins for most of my life, and have forgiven the sins of others.<\/p><p>I also believe in equality before the law, and the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, wrote to me again today to point out to me why I am wrong about this Bill.  It has referred, throughout its summary of the Bill and its subsequent lobbying, to clarity, transparency, and fairness.  Going though its arguments is like reading the memorare, because every second sentence is about clarity, transparency and fairness.  Where is the clarity, transparency and fairness for victims and their families?  There is no certainty in mandatory life sentences.  A family member of a murder victim told me they will never get justice, because nobody ever believes murder will happen to them or their families.  They do not believe it because it is too ugly, and they never think it will come their way.  I am offering clarity, transparency and fairness under the auspices of certainty in this section.  That is all I am offering.  One cannot have clarity, transparency, or fairness without certainty.<\/p><p>In this section, the Government appears entirely incapable of walking even a few centimetres in the shoes of the families and communities of homicide victims.  Is the Minister of State so lacking in any kind of emotional or legislative maturity that, until he holds his own brutally murdered son or daughter in a morgue, he will be incapable of understanding that offender-led justice means only one thing - victims for the criminal classes?  I am speaking about murder.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, quangos, advisers, and groups lack bravery and I am now questioning my lifelong loyalty to Fine Gael.  I saw the Government's lack of judgment when dealing with farmers yesterday.  I have also seen it both generally and in the areas of health and housing, but it has now come to my door.  I am a patron of AdVIC, and I have spent years dealing with people who have been destroyed forever by what has happened to them, but we are now coming up with legislation for offenders.  I have hundreds of files about this.  I want to see the same equality and balance for the offended as for the offender, in cases of first-degree murder.  I am not referring to anything but first-degree murder, and I do not want to get involved in anything else because those are issues for the Judiciary.  Neither I, my colleagues in AdVIC, the wider group of families who have lost members to violent murder, or the public will sit idly by any more when we open newspapers every day to be met with stories of violent murder.  This terrified Oireachtas continues to make a mockery of the lives of innocent victims.  I demand that this section, which states, \"When imposing sentence upon a person, a sentencing judge may impose a specified period during which that person shall not be eligible for parole\", be reinstated.  I disagree with its omission and will call for a vote on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#AA00400","speaker":"1427","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I listened with courtesy to what Senator O'Donnell said.  I acknowledge her great passion and commitment, and her work with AdVIC.  I too have worked with AdVIC and have worked on victims' rights for many years.  However, I have also worked with offenders, both as a criminal justice practitioner and as an activist.  I take grave exception to the Senator's critiques of the IPRT and her attacks on that excellent organisation.  I served on the board of the trust many years ago.  IPRT is a non-governmental organisation.  It is not a quango or an arm of the State and cannot be characterised as such.  The trust has, over many years, taken brave and courageous stances in support of penal reform.<\/p> <p>The IPRT's call for placing the Parole Board on statutory footing has not been made in isolation.  Many others have called for it, including the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, on which I was proud to serve as a member during the previous Seanad, along with Senator Conway, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State.  In 2013, that committee recommended placing the parole process on a statutory footing.  The Department of Justice and Equality has also acknowledged that need over many years, so it has not been called for by only one body or organisation.  It is a well-established, important reform of our penal process.  While we have a Parole Board, it needs a statutory framework, and that is important.  Placing the Parole Board on a statutory footing has also been a long-standing policy of my own party.<\/p> <p>This reform is not only in the best interests of offenders.  Ensuring a structured programme for the release of persons serving long sentences, whether indeterminate life sentences for murder or any other long sentence, is also in the best interests of both victims and our society as a whole.  The current practice, whereby persons are eligible for parole after seven years of a long sentence, will change under this section, and that minimum term will be extended to 12 years to give certainty to victims and their families.  That term may be too long and may lengthen the time people serve, given that the average life sentence term served is 18 years.  However, parole is a process and consideration of applications may start years before a person is released.<\/p> <p>I also acknowledge Senator O'Donnell's great initiative in bringing forward opportunities for us to discuss life sentences for murder, and I was delighted to participate in that debate on her Bill.  However, I cannot support this amendment - and I did not support her Bill - although I supported the opportunity to debate life sentencing.  We should not have mandatory minimum sentencing in our laws generally, though it is provided for in other legislation.  Indeed, sections 24(11) to (15), inclusive, of this section refer to presumptive minimum terms under firearms, drugs, and sex offences provisions.  It would be better to do away with mandatory life sentences for murder and replace them with determinate sentencing, subject to a maximum of life imprisonment, as we have for manslaughter.  Anyone who has worked in criminal justice will know that a conviction for murder may relate to a broad spectrum of human behaviour, or killing that may include premeditated, gangland crime on one end and less serious offences on the other.  While each murder is deeply devastating for victim's family, an argument could be made for structured discretion in sentencing for murder, subject to the maximum of life imprisonment, just as there is for manslaughter and rape.  That is the bigger reform I would like us to consider, but I accept that it is beyond the scope of this Bill.<\/p> <p>This Bill provides for a sensible and structured statutory framework for the consideration of eligibility for release on parole of persons serving long-term sentences.  I have critiqued some aspects of that.  It is unfortunate that consideration is not given specifically to children, or those under 18 years old, who are serving life sentences in this section.  Twelve years is a long time to wait before eligibility for parole in the life of a child.  I will support Senator Ruane's amendment No. 4, which is coming up next, which would grant more flexibility in when someone can be considered eligible for parole.  That would be a sensible reform.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend the Irish Penal Reform Trust for its great work.  There has been, at my instigation, an Oireachtas all-party group on penal reform, which has met quite a number of times over various years.  We might reinstitute it in September.  I hope all colleagues who have an interest in penal reform, particularly Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, would attend those meetings and meet the Irish Penal Reform Trust, Advic and others to discuss how best to make progress on penal reform matters.  The Judicial Council Bill is very important because it will provide for sentencing guidelines for the first time and we will then see the structured discretion in sentencing that we need.  The Parole Bill is an important reform, flawed in some ways with an unfortunately short timeframe in which we have to debate it, but very much worthy and deserving of our support.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust is quite right to support it, not just in the interests of offenders but in the interests of victims and all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#BB00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I will not take much of the Minister's time in what I have to say.  One of the great things about being in the Seanad is that we can sit and listen to debate and different sides of the argument.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's passion and conviction in this area is beyond question, as is her commitment to Advic.  Those who have suffered at the hands of the cold-blooded murderers we are speaking about deserve more certainty in their lives.<\/p> <p>I see what Senator Bacik is speaking about and I accept that a more determined system would probably be better where we could have some certainty when people are being sentenced, but we are faced with a Bill that is going through today and the amendment, unless I am completely misreading it, is very simple.  What we are doing is giving discretion to judges where the most horrendous crimes take place.  I fully agree with Senator Bacik that murder occurs for many different reasons and rationales.  I am mindful of murders that took place in Ireland in 1976 or 1977, when two men went on a rampage throughout the country and one unfortunate young girl was pulled out of a lake in Connemara.  These guys came here with nothing else to do.  That is what they wanted to do.  They wanted to murder young women.  To think they could find themselves before a parole board in seven or 12 years would be unthinkable.  I remember the period in Galway at the time.  The entire city was in absolute terror because it was known these guys were in town.  When they were eventually put in jail surely to God it was not beyond the capability of the judge to state they should not go before a parole board for 20 years.  It happens in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>I agree with the approach of Senator Bacik, and I accept that if a Bill comes at some stage in the future we would amend this, but right now I fully support Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell in what she is trying to do.  I fully support the people in Advic.  I cannot imagine what it must be like to be the mother or father of a murdered child and to see the murderer 12 years later walking down the street.  I cannot imagine what that must be like.  I always think of that young boy - I cannot remember his name - who was taken on his way home from lunch at school.

Notwithstanding the content of the amendment, it is extremely important for us that when we think about people who work in penal reform, such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust, it is not an offender versus a victim or introducing offending legislation.  People who look to reform the penal system, the parole system and the justice system do so with the same ultimate goal of reducing crime.  When people work with offenders in terms of applying human rights principles and rehabilitative principles to the prison system it is with the ultimate goal that when the person is reintegrated into society and let out that there are no more victims.  This is not to ignore the current victims of a particular crime.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has stated every time it speaks about offenders that it also speaks about the need for victim support and it is not that one cancels out the other.  We need to be very clear that working with offenders in penal reform is looking to reduce crime, recidivism and the number of victims.  It is not to disregard all that victims have gone through and do go through or to ignore victims' rights in any shape or form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#CC00500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell on bringing forward this important amendment.

I am sure it was only a matter of time before she or Senator Bacik did so.  I was going to make passing reference to the Catholic Church's evolving teaching on capital punishment, which is interesting.  We are not, thankfully, in a capital punishment regime here.  To recap on what I said last week in that debate, when section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990 abolished the death penalty for any offence in Ireland it formally removed the concept of an eye for an eye from our criminal justice code.  No human being should ever be deprived of his or her life for any reason whatsoever, no matter how heinous the crime.  It is interesting to see how the Catholic Church's teaching has evolved in this area.  Certainly under Pope John Paul II the position was very much that it could be acceptable in theory, and this is in the current catechism.  One could imagine a country where there was no law and order and where it was not possible to safely incarcerate people, but the position was that it is hard to imagine circumstances in which it could ever be justified.  Pope Francis has moved to put the lid on that and state capital punishment can never be justified.  This is a position with which we are all comfortable.  Respect for life at all stages is what we should aspire to in our law, from its very beginnings to its very end, without exceptions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The abolition of the harsh penalty of death involves a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>, that is, if the ultimate penalty is not to be available in law, surely it must be expected that the tariff for the most serious crime, murder, should reflect its sheer gravity.  That would bring some closure to victims&rsquo; families, to the extent that it could ever be possible in those awful circumstances.  We cannot and should not take a &quot;lock them up and throw away the key&quot; approach to sentencing, as they seem to do in the United States or at least some parts of it.  We must try to ensure the perpetrators of crime are not viewed as a lost cause, incapable of redemption.  In an ideal world we would always hope convicted criminals were capable of redemption and reintegration into society.  It is worth our while reflecting on the purpose of sentencing, which I accept is to punish.  That part is included.  There is a penalty due for the wrong one does and it is due to society for the wrong one does to its individual members.  There is a lot we could say about the necessary investment of time and resources in systems of restorative justice where justice can also be rendered in some way to the direct victim of the crime which obviously is not possible in the case of murder, but punishment is included as is prevention, while the person is incarcerated, and deterrence, in that others will I hope be prevented by the successful operation of investigation, prosecution, conviction and sentencing.  Rehabilitation must always be central to our purposes.  There is a balancing that is needed in the system, but before we can win widespread support for the work of rehabilitation, redemption and reintegration into society, it seems that the public must rest assured that an adequate punishment has been imposed and a proper sentence is being served.  That is part of the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>in seeking public confidence in and support for a humane criminal justice system.<br\/><br\/>It is almost barstool chatter in Ireland.  When one hears that somebody was sentenced to life imprisonment, the automatic reaction is to think to oneself that life means X number of years and that the person will be out in seven.  There is a need for clarity from the beginning for the integrity of the system, at least to a certain degree, because behaviour in prison and the evolution of a person in it can and should have an impact on matters thereafter.  That is part of the work of the Parole Board.  Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell and AdVIC noted that what was being proposed mirrored the practice in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom.  That is the reason I support her amendment, although I would perhaps like to see it changed from being the imposition of a specified period to giving the ability to judges to recommend the specified period.

There is a lot of talk these days about the need to name and create penalties for specific hate crimes.  While I understand the thinking and sentiment behind it, it is fundamentally wrong-headed because very often it is the intersection of identity politics and criminal justice.  The attitude that lies behind the crime, whether it be sexism, racism or other moral fault, is something that must be dealt with separately, through the education system and in all of the ways we try to socialise citizens.  It may also be relevant to the sentence imposed but creating specific crimes to differentiate between different categories of people who suffer and are the victims of the same crime is wrong.

To clarify, what I favour is more wholesale reform of sentencing for murder.  As Senator Conway is well aware, we do not have the concept of first or second degree murder in our law.  Anyone convicted of murder, regardless of the context, receives a mandatory life sentence.  That is what I would like to see us change.  I accept that it is not possible to do so in the Bill before us, but we should move towards a system where judges would have discretion in sentencing for murder, subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, in the same way as they do in sentencing for manslaughter or rape.<\/p> <p>I cannot support Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's amendment because it would mean that a judge in sentencing a person within the current system, under which there is a mandatory indeterminate life sentence for murder, would be empowered to prescribe a minimum period of custody during which a person would not be eligible for parole.  That would lengthen the time persons would serve prior to being eligible for parole and could amount to a double punishment where somebody had been sentenced to what was an indeterminate term of life imprisonment.  Within the framework envisaged by the Bill, a person would be eligible for parole after 12 years, but there would be an additional layer, if the amendment were to be passed, whereby they would not be eligible for parole until another term had been served.  I do not see that as a sensible or reasonable approach to take to sentencing within the current system.  That is the reason I oppose it.  As I said, I am opposed generally to the concept of mandatory minimum sentencing.  It is better to set maximums in sentencing legislation and allow tructured discretion in sentencing guidelines for judges.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The average life sentence served in Ireland is 18 years but there are quite a number of people serving life sentences who have been in prison for more than 20 years.

The other Bill is not dead, it is very much alive.  Parole is a separate matter, although undoubtedly it is related.<\/p> <p>Section 24 sets out who is eligible for parole.  Currently, and in the Bill as originally introduced, parole is available to life-sentence prisoners and those serving sentences of eight years or more.  The Bill was amended in the D&aacute;il so that parole will, at least initially, only be available to life-sentence prisoners, and only after serving a period of 12 years rather than seven, which is a big change.  The new eligibility criteria will apply to prisoners whether they were sentenced before or after the Act comes into force, and the Minister can extend the eligibility by regulation to prisoners serving sentences greater than eight years, having regard to various criteria set out in the section.<\/p> <p>The Minister is acutely aware of the genuine concerns which underlie the proposal in the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  The Senator&rsquo;s Private Members' Bill was discussed here last week on Second Stage.  I did not have an opportunity to speak, given the time constraints that the House was operating under at the time.  I look forward to that discussion continuing when the debate resumes.<\/p> <p>However, I do not believe the Parole Bill is the place to deal with this specific measure, which is really a matter of sentencing policy.  Having said that, the Parole Bill itself contains very significant measures in relation to the lengths of sentences served by prisoners before being eligible for parole.  The concerns of victims and their families are taken very seriously and were to the forefront of minds when the Bill was being developed and worked on in the Department.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are part of the fundamental underlying rationale for the Bill, which provides for the first time that a prisoner with a life sentence will become eligible for parole after that prisoner has served 12 years of a life sentence.  When a prisoner is serving multiple consecutive sentences, he or she must complete any fixed-term sentence before the 12-year sentence requirement even starts.  In these, thankfully, rare and terrible circumstances, the person would not be eligible to be considered for many more than 12 years.  If a person has two consecutive sentences, he or she serves the first one and then the life one kicks in.  It is 12 years after that parole is considered, which is a major change.  Senator Craughwell mentioned a case, and that will apply in other such cases.<br\/><br\/>The Bill does not contain anything that would prevent the board from taking into account any judicial decision or recommendation on sentencing.  It does the opposite in that it specifically lists the remarks of the judge who is sentencing as one of the matters to which the board shall have regard when making its assessment.  That is another move in the direction of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's amendment.  Ultimately, the Bill is designed to deal with parole, which is a particular type of conditional early release; it is not designed to deal with sentencing except to ensure that parole does not interfere with minimum terms provided for elsewhere in law.<br\/><br\/>I remind the House about some of the measures that the Government is taking with regard to sentencing policy.  Senator Bacik mentioned the Judicial Council Bill, which provides for the drawing up of sentencing guidelines by the Judiciary, which has been long called for.  The type of measure that the Senator wishes to insert here is, I believe, a change to sentencing policy.  The Senator introduced a Bill on a similar theme in 2017 and at that time, the then Minister, former Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, said that such a proposal would benefit from consultation with members of the Judiciary and other experts.  I am not sure whether these consultations have happened.  Perhaps they were undertaken in preparation for the Senator's 2019 Bill.  If so, I would be interested to hear from her about the outcomes when the debate on the other Bill resumes.  Has she had an opportunity to talk to judges and other experts in the court, and what have they said?  I believe that this type of change deserves its own space and own debate.  Nothing in the Bill before us precludes that.<br\/><br\/>While the Bill can complement and sit alongside sentencing reform, the sentencing measures themselves belong elsewhere and I will not support the amendment for that reason.  Senator O'Donnell has said that her amendment applies only to life sentences and murder, which she stressed strongly, more than once.  I point out that the amendment as drafted does not state this anywhere.  This Bill greatly enhances the participation of victims and provides for both legal aid and legal representation for victims but the amendment does not mention anything about murder.  That means it could be giving the judges that power with regard to any sentence.  We have to be very careful when drafting legislation.  It has to be focused and specific, and we have to be careful about unintended consequences.<br\/><br\/>I indicated on Second Stage that I would address some of the points raised.  Senator McDowell mentioned sections 24(1)(<i>b<\/i>), 24(3) and 24(4)(<i>d<\/i>).  These subsections deal with what happens in the event that the Minister extends the eligibility criteria, by regulation, to cover prisoners serving fixed-term sentences.  Sections 24(1)(<i>b<\/i>) and 24(3) provide that the regulations may set out the length of term of sentence and the portion of that term that must have been served before the prisoner is eligible for parole.  Senator McDowell is correct in that it does not provide for different types of offences to be treated differently for eligibility purposes.  For example, a prisoner serving a 12-year sentence for assault would be treated similarly to a prisoner serving the same length of sentence for burglary when deciding whether they are eligible.  The decision here is only whether they can apply to be considered.  The nature and gravity of the offence is something that will be taken into account by the Parole Board in reaching its decision and the Bill provides for that in section 27.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of section 24(4)(<i>d<\/i>) is to require the Minister, in making regulations, to take account of the need for people serving different lengths of sentences to be treated fairly when compared to each other and to those serving life sentences.  The regulations should not make it more advantageous, for example, to be serving a life sentence than a sentence of 20 years.  The regulations must try to set the eligibility criteria so that those sentenced to longer terms do not become eligible before those serving shorter terms.  This is the intention here.  It is worded in drafting language, but its purpose is to ensure fairness insofar as it is possible.<br\/><br\/>That is all I have to say on this at this time.  I made the main point, which is that another Bill is before the House that deals specifically with Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's amendments.  This is a parole Bill, not a sentencing Bill.  The amendment as drafted is quite loose in some ways so we are not in a position to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#EE00900","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his excellent explanation.

We can speed up this process for it to run as quickly and efficiently as possible for the benefit of applicants and for the board.  I do not see why a board could not adjudicate on application before the applicant becomes officially eligible, and then allow the decision to become formal once eligibility was reached.  The amendment would remove an unnecessary administrative barrier to the board deciding on applications that were already right in front of it since the Bill already allows an applicant to apply before his or her parole is up.  This would simply allow the process to move quicker and if an application is successful, the applicant would avail of parole sooner and for an unsuccessful application the person could go back to working on the reapplication sooner.

I have already spoken about my issue with lengthening the time before a person becomes eligible for parole from seven years, which is the current practice, to 12 years.  I am concerned that this will reduce the potential for rehabilitation of individuals.  As the Irish Penal Reform Trust has pointed out to us, the parole process does take some time.  Engagement by prisoners with services and treatments often is strengthened once the first parole is scheduled and the first parole review is generally only the beginning of the review process.  If we only schedule the first parole review at 12 years, it will prolong the period before a person may engage sufficiently with rehabilitation.  It also reduces the capacity for rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  For a number of reasons it would be better to have more flexibility.  This is what Senator Ruane's amendment seeks to do.  It proposes to delete subsection (4) from section 26.<\/p> <p>It seems particularly harsh in the case of children serving sentences for life imprisonment when release on parole is only considered at 12 years, even if he or she has made applications prior to the 12 years.  The Minister has not engaged with me on this although I have raised it a number of times.  I have combed through the Bill to see if there is any reference to children in it.  The only reference I can see is in section 13(2)(b), which refers to prisons or children detention schools.  Clearly the Bill applies to children in that the persons applying for parole can be children.  This is envisaged in section 13.  The 12 years is a lengthy period and the provision in section 26(4) that states \"the Board shall not consider the person&rsquo;s release on parole prior to the date on which he or she becomes so eligible\" just prolongs the period before which there can be no consideration of an application for parole.  I believe it would be better to have a little more flexibility built in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#GG01000","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>On that last point, the period that a child sentenced to life imprisonment spends in a child detention centre does count in determining when they are eligible, but they cannot apply for parole while still a minor.  There are other provisions in law that deal with the release of children.  I hope this answers the point made by Senator Bacik.<\/p> <p>With regard to the proposed amendment No. 4, section 26 provides that the board will write to the prisoner telling the prisoner when he or she will be eligible for parole and asking whether he or she wishes to be considered.  That is the first step.  The prisoner's written confirmation that he or she wishes to be considered is the application for parole.  The parole board will, whenever possible, give the prisoner six months' advance notice of becoming eligible.  The amendment proposes to delete section 26(4) that says the board shall not consider the person&rsquo;s release on parole prior to the date on which he or she becomes so eligible.  The Senator's amendment would have the effect of allowing prisoners to be considered by the board before they are actually eligible.  I believe the existing wording is very clear and reflects precisely what is intended in raising the point at which a person becomes eligible for parole to 12 years.   The board will have written to the prisoner six months in advance of the eligibility date and the prisoner can use this time to prepare his or her case with the assistance of his or her legal representative.  The board can consider the matter once the prisoner has fulfilled the eligibility requirements, which I believe are clear and reasonable.  For that reason I am not in a position to support the amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#GG01100","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"vote","time":1562837400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 10; N\u00edl, 22.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Lynn Ruane and Ivana Bacik; N\u00edl, Deputies Gabrielle McFadden and John O'Mahony.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019071100002#GG01200","aye":["1402","1378","1388","1389","1405","1417","1398","1413","1410","1404"],"nay":["1407","1409","1380","1391","1384","1376","1416","1414","1383","1424","1396","1438","1386","1439","1375","1425","1406","1374","1426","1397","1421","1399"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562837400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Section 26 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562837400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Sections 27 to 29, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562837400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>SECTION 30<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1562837400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 29, lines 28 and 29. to delete all words from and including &quot;and&quot; in line 28 down to and including line 29.<\/blockquote> <p>The amendment seeks to delete the provision that states that where an applicant has been unsuccessful and the Parole Board has written to the Irish Prison Service advising it on how the applicant's sentence could be better managed to produce a successful application for parole, the recommendations are explicitly non-binding.

A decision to refuse must be in writing and include reasons and a date not more than two years later than when he or she will become eligible to be reconsidered for parole.  When parole is refused, the board can make recommendations to the Prison Service in respect of sentence management that will help the prisoner prepare for his or her next application.  This is done by the current non-statutory board.  The board might recommend, for example, measures that could further the prisoner's rehabilitation, such as the prisoner undergoing a treatment programme in prison, being granted short periods of release, or spending time in an open prison to help him or her to acclimatise generally and gradually to new freedoms and see how he or she copes.

It is important that legislation be certain.  In the Minister's view, the management of prisoners is, and must remain, a matter for the governor of the prison and the Prison Service., although the prison governor will always take seriously the recommendations of the Parole Board.  We must allow for circumstances where, through no fault of the prisoner or the prison, it might not be possible to implement the recommendations of the Parole Board.  For example, the board may make a recommendation that a prisoner move to an open prison but it could transpire that the open prison is located far from the prisoner's family.  It would not be practicable or desirable, therefore, for him or her to make such a move.  Similarly, a recommendation that a prisoner attend a course or participate in treatment could turn out to be unsuitable or unhelpful.  Such decisions are dynamic and must take account of circumstances on the ground and day-to-day realities.<\/p> <p>The amendment would take the power to make decisions about day-to-day management of certain prisoners out of the hands of the prison governor, who deals with the consequences of those decisions.  Ultimately, the governor and the Prison Service are best placed to make the final decisions on such matters.  It is not the intention or practice of the Prison Service to ignore recommendations of the Parole Board.  The governors and the Prison Service are anxious to assist and support prisoners to rehabilitate.  While it is in their interest to do so, it is also their professional role and, in many instances, personal ambition.  They are the people dealing with sentence management day to day.  The recommendations can be recommendations only and the Bill needs to provide clarity that this is the case.

There seems to be a discrepancy in the wording of the sections, including in that of the section before us, about whether notifications are to be made to the parolee or to his or her representative.  It arises in section 31(6), which states the board is to provide a copy of the decision on varying the parole order to the parolee, while in section 31(2), an application to vary may be made by or on behalf of the parolee.  That is in contrast to section 26, which seems to contain no provision for the initial application for parole to be made on behalf of the prisoner.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether the absence of the words \"on behalf of\" in section 26 means that the application must be made by the person, particularly in view of the fact that, under section 31, the application to vary may be made by or on behalf of the parolee?

It is again unclear as to whether submissions must be made by the victim or the victim's family or by their legal representative.  There is a slight difference of language between where applications may be made on behalf of a parolee or victim or where they must be made by the victim or parolee themselves.

The Government decided in April 2017 to support the Bill and has worked extensively with Deputy O'Callaghan and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to develop amendments to the Bill.  I was very pleased to see such broad support in the Houses and would like to acknowledge this spirit of co-operation and genuine understanding here in this House on these issues, which we all agree has lent itself to a very positive and engaging debate today.  It is true to say that the principal ideas and values underlying the original Bill introduced by Deputy O'Callaghan on 24 May 2016 have remained intact.  I congratulate the Deputy on what is very important and comprehensive legislation.<\/p> <p>As Members are aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality currently makes the final decision on parole, which in legal terms at present is a form of renewable temporary release, taking account of recommendations from the non-statutory parole board.  Under this Bill the final decision on release will be a matter for the statutory parole board and the release will be on parole proper, a form of conditional release rather than temporary release.  The criteria used in making the decision will be clear and open and the factors to be taken into account will be set out in statute.  The Bill also raises the eligibility criteria for being considered for the first time for parole to those who served 12 years of a life sentence rather than the current seven years, which the Minister believes is a necessary and proportionate measure to balance rights of these long-sentence prisoners with the need to ensure that the issue of early release is not raised to trouble further the hearts and minds of victims and their families at a point where there is no real prospect of release.<\/p> <p>The sentence management facility from which prisoners currently benefit, whereby they are advised and encouraged to take measures themselves to rehabilitate and prepare for the day when they may finally be able to move outside the prison and serve the remainder of their sentence in the community, provided they are of good conduct and do not breach any conditions, will, for prisoners not eligible for parole under the new system, continue to be managed by the Irish Prison Service, which is expert in this area and well placed to put these measures in place in ways that are tailored to the individual circumstances of each sentenced person.<\/p> <p>In summary, this is a good Bill.  I support its intentions and together with my colleagues here today, I would like to see it enacted as soon as possible.  I again thank colleagues in the Seanad for the excellent debate here today, with very interesting questions raised and points made, some robustly and strongly, and that is to be expected when people feel something passionately.

We have put together a really strong Bill which will underpin quality and the agenda in the higher and further education sector.

That said, there are many fine providers.<\/p> <p>The introduction of the international education mark, IEM, will bring much needed regulation to the English language education sector.  Quality standards will be underpinned by the IEM, providing greater assurance and protections for staff and students in the sector.
