No apologies have been received.  Please note that to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people&rsquo;s physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice.  When people are speaking, obviously they can take off their masks.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Peter Kinsley, deputy director of audit, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning, we engage with the University of Limerick, UL, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The university has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters to which the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention: non-compliant procurement; the purchase of a site for the city campus, formerly known as the Dunnes Stores site; the overriding of controls; and the president&rsquo;s remuneration.  UL has also been advised the committee might wish to examine the fact the Department had withheld capital funding until certain governance issues have been resolved.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the university: Professor Kerstin Mey, president; Ms Mary Harney, chancellor; and Mr. Gary Butler, chief financial performance officer.  We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science: Mr. Keith Moynes, assistant secretary with responsibility for the higher education policy division; and Ms Emma Leonard, principal officer with responsibility for the climate action and capital planning unit.<\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As such witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits or objective of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652344200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The group total income of the University of Limerick for the accounting year 2019-2020 was &euro;288 million.  Some &euro;90 million of this is recurrent State grant and pension funding.  Academic fees amounted to &euro;113 million, with 28% of this received directly from the Higher Education Authority.  Research income recognised in the year was &euro;33 million, including more than &euro;23 million from State sources.  In the year, other income fell by &euro;6 million, largely due to the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions.  Total expenditure of the group in 2019-2020 was &euro;285 million, representing an increase of &euro;4 million.  Pay and pension costs account for &euro;196 million of this.  The group surplus for the year 2019-2020 was &euro;3.9 million, and this compared with a deficit of &euro;2.1 million in the previous year.<\/p> <p>  I am satisfied that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the transactions for the year and of the financial position of the university at end of September 2020.  Consequently, my audit opinion on the financial statements was unqualified.  As is the case for other universities, the audit report includes an emphasis on matters relating to the deferred pension funding asset.  The purpose of this is to draw attention to the assumptions that underpin that part of the pension asset for which there is no explicit funding guarantee.<\/p> <p>  My audit report also draws attention to four matters that are disclosed in the university&rsquo;s annual statement of governance that accompanies the financial statements.  The first matter is the significant expenditure incurred by the university on procurement that was not in compliance with the relevant procurement procedures.  The second matter relates to the purchase of a property in Limerick in April 2019 for the development of a city centre campus.  Arising from concerns raised by an employee, the university engaged a firm of consultants to conduct a review of the purchase.  The review included an examination of the university&rsquo;s due diligence procedures around the purchase as well as the accuracy of the information provided to the governing authority when its approval was sought for the purchase.  Members will be aware from updates provided by the university that finalisation and dissemination of the report has been held up as a result of High Court proceedings.<\/p> <p>  The third matter I draw attention to arises from an investigation into a series of allegations made in 2017 and 2020 about the actions of a member of the university&rsquo;s senior management.  The investigator found the senior manager had breached the university&rsquo;s recruitment and procurement policies and procedures and, in relation to one of the allegations, the senior manager&rsquo;s actions were both inappropriate and unprofessional.  The senior manager had left the university before the investigation report was completed in November 2020.  The statement of governance sets out the progress in implementing the recommendations in the investigation report.<\/p> <p>  The final matter I draw attention to in my audit report relates to the arrangements entered into by the university relating to the resignation of the former president, effective from the end of August 2020.  The contract of employment with the former president did not contain clauses dealing with early termination or a notice period, which are standard clauses in employment contracts.  Following negotiations, the university paid an amount equivalent to four months&rsquo; salary, some &euro;65,000, and just over &euro;30,000 in respect of legal costs incurred by the former president.  It also incurred legal costs of more than &euro;15,000 on its own behalf.<\/p> <p>  Having reviewed the documentation relating to these payments, in my view, the agreement with the former president has the typical characteristics of a severance agreement.  Therefore, before agreeing to the terms for ending the employment, the university should have consulted the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about what was proposed and secured the prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Those steps were not taken in this case.  The statement of governance presents the university&rsquo;s view that the arrangement with the former president around his departure was not a severance agreement and, therefore, did not require prior approval of the Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1652344200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Mey back to the committee for her second appearance.

Those in attendance with me are Ms Mary Harney, chancellor of the University of Limerick, and Mr. Gary Butler, chief financial and performance officer.<\/p> <p>  If the Chairman will allow, I would like to briefly share some thoughts on the institution, of which I am extremely proud to be president.  A modern university must meet a variety of societal needs.  It must be: a centre of high quality education and research; a place for the discovery of new knowledge and better understanding about the world and ourselves; and, perhaps most importantly, a vital force in realising the full cultural, social and economic potential of the communities it serves.  Since its establishment, the University of Limerick has been a dynamic catalyst for change for the people of Limerick, the broader mid-west and nationally.  The capacity of our university to build and sustain deep and mutually beneficial relationships with industry continues to be a major driver of the region&rsquo;s economic prosperity and social transformation.  In addition, our strong academic and growing international research profile has attracted talented people across a broad range of disciplines, nationalities and cultures to come here to study, live and work.<\/p> <p>  Beginning this month, the University of Limerick will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its establishment in 1972.  In addition to celebrating our unique heritage, this will be an opportunity for us to articulate and promote our excellence in research and education and highlight the extraordinary achievements of our students, alumni and staff.  This important anniversary also coincides with, and has very much informed, our current strategic plan, UL@50, which we have recently refreshed, and also the development of our sustainability framework, which will provide us with a roadmap for development over the next decade.  Students are at the heart of everything we do and the campus settings in which they receive their education is to the forefront of our drive for sustainability.  Our objective during the lifetime of the strategic plan and beyond is to ensure that the university continues to evolve and prosper and contributes to a thriving world so that we can continue to provide future generations with an exceptional, inclusive and recreational environment in which they can excel.<\/p> <p>  I would like to share with the committee the performance of University of Limerick relative to its peers during the past number of years.  We are honoured to be the recipient of multiple awards for our world class campus, marketing and communications success, excellence in the provision of academic and professional services, gender equality in higher education, our research and for our incredible Erasmus programme.  In addition, we have: grown our student numbers to well over 17,500; our graduate employment is up 15% on the national average; we have become the first Irish university to engage with apprenticeships from level 7 up to doctorate qualification; and we have surpassed 10% of employment market share in Limerick.<\/p> <p>  Regarding our financial position, as requested, I have provided the committee with a comprehensive briefing paper outlining the university&rsquo;s financial position at the end of the 2019-20 year.  I have also provided some more detail on many of the matters which members raised at our previous attendance before committee.  My intention in so doing is to assure the committee of my personal commitment, as president, to ensuring our university&rsquo;s sterling reputation for excellence in education and research shall be matched by a commitment to the highest standards in corporate governance, transparency and accountability, and an open and inclusive, supportive and empowered organisational culture.<\/p> <p>  The 2019-20 year was unique and was characterised by the extraordinary uncertainty that accompanied the arrival of a global pandemic.  We also had to contend with the evolution of Brexit.  The governing authority, executive committee and staff of the university, in partnership with the student unions, worked tirelessly to ensure the continuation of academic activities and impactful research while also safeguarding our financially sustainability.  In the relevant period, the university returned a surplus of &euro;3.9 million.  The executive committee and the governing authority are agreed that this surplus must be reinvested in areas that will directly and demonstrably further enhance the student and staff experience, including implementing the broad learnings from Covid-19.  At this month's governing authority meeting we agreed to consult widely, especially with the student body on our intentions in that regard.  The consolidated university statement of comprehensive income and net profit for the year to 30 September 2020 are shown on page 38 of the financial statements.  During the period in question, Covid-19 impacted virtually all areas of the university&rsquo;s activities.  From 12 March 2020, the campus was effectively closed to staff and students.  While we continue to adhere to public health guidance and to assess ongoing and any permanent financial impact of the pandemic, it appears the worst is now behind us.  Happily, the university is emerging from the pandemic in very good financial health.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued an unqualified audit opinion on the financial statements for 2019-20.  The university welcomes this.  In the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on information other than in the financial statements, attention is drawn to procurement non-compliance as disclosed in the annual governance statement; the purchase of a site for the city campus, the override of controls and the president&rsquo;s remuneration.  With respect to procurement, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to a sustained reduction in the percentage of such expenditure deemed non-compliant.  In the relevant period, non-compliance was 0.6%.  That is two thirds lower than the prevailing rate in the sector, which is 1.8%.  I am pleased to advise the committee that the university is one of the leading institutions regarding procurement compliance.  There is still room for improvement, and I have outlined a number of further and better controls we have put in place.  These will identify any future inadvertent or deliberate breach of public procurement protocols.<\/p> <p>  The university is wholeheartedly committed to its civil and civic mission, and this is very much reflected in our strategic plan and the refreshed plan.  We intend to contribute fully to the rejuvenation of Limerick city and we are working closely with our partners, including Limerick City and County Council, in that regard.  We have opened up part of our existing city centre campus where our digital fabrication lab offers opportunities for exploration and learning to University of Limerick students as well as the community.  The renovated space includes a Limerick City and County Council Community Engagement Hub and a further flexible space for teaching and events, which is heavily utilised.  When circumstances permit, we hope to make the significant capital investment that will be required in order to develop a truly vibrant city campus, accessible to everyone and an exemplar of sustainability.<\/p> <p>  I am well aware the committee has been particularly concerned to understand the circumstances which gave rise to the university&rsquo;s acquisition of the former Dunnes Stores site for &euro;8.343 million.  KPMG was commissioned to conduct a review, which has been completed but which is the subject of a legal challenge.  We are working with our legal advisers to try to unblock impediments to its publication.  I appreciate this is still a very live issue.  However, I hope the committee would permit me to draw a distinction between the process by which the property was acquired, arising from which the governing authority commissioned the KPMG review, and the enormous civic potential of this strategic site in the centre of Limerick city on the banks of the Shannon, which gives me cause for great optimism about the future of our city centre campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Kerstin Mey"},{"type":"speech","time":1652344200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time.

I hope it is not a barrier to our discussion this morning.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot to discuss and I have a limited amount of time.  I welcome our witnesses.  The big thing I would like to discuss at the outset is the city centre campus.  Primarily I would like to afford time to the witnesses to take us through from April 2019 until today.  I heard them speak about the investment in the site and their excitement for the university about this site.  This cannot overlook the enormous cost of the site and the increased cost of the site from &euro;3 million originally when it was valued by Limerick City and County Council to what was paid for it at more than &euro;8 million.  Will the witnesses take us through the reason for the increase in costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#C03200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652344200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Devlin.  It is a very obvious question as to how we went from &euro;3 million to &euro;8 million.  This did not happen.  The &euro;3 million referred to, both in the public domain and here, was a valuation done on behalf of Limerick City and County Council for the purposes of declaring the site derelict and putting it on the vacant site register.  It was the council's intention to compulsorily purchase the site.  Dunnes took on the council and got a judicial review.  The council did not succeed in having the site declared derelict and put on the vacant site register.  I want to read from the so-called valuation.  It was carried out by a highly reputable national company.  It states that the figure it provided was on a high-level desktop basis and represented its estimate of value of the unencumbered freehold interest in the property.  It also states that in order to undertake a full evaluation, it would need to obtain confirmation of floor areas and undertake inspection.  It further states that it would also need to know the planning potential of the site.  The valuation document indicates that in view of the location of the property, it was likely at a minimum to be able to sustain six floors and perhaps more.  It states that based on this approach, it could look at a valuation appraisal to assist in determining what the site value or acceptable purchase price would be.  There was no &euro;3 million valuation as a market value.  It was a valuation done to declare the site derelict to put it on the vacant site register and for the council to compulsorily purchase it.  The affidavit presented in the judicial hearing in which Dunnes got a stay showed that on 30 September 2015 and subsequently the council indicated it wanted to compulsorily purchase the site.  I understand it might have wanted to put a cultural centre there.<\/p> <p>  In 2013 or 2014, UL decided it should have a city centre campus as an experience for students and to play its part in the strategic development of the city.  It looked at a number of sites and identified the Dunnes site as the preferred site.  It is an iconic riverside site.  It has been described as the preferred site in Limerick.  Unfortunately, it was not available.  Discussions took place with Dunnes over the time but it was not for selling.  There was not a willing seller.  There was a willing buyer.  In April 2019, Dunnes indicated that it wanted to engage with the university to see if it was still interested.  The university engaged in negotiations.  Dunnes looked for &euro;10 million.  I understand from the documentation given to the governing authority that the university put &euro;6.5 million on the table and that those involved in the negotiations settled on &euro;8 million.<\/p> <p>  When we made the decision to purchase this site on 5 April it was a unanimous decision.  I have read there were dissenters.  There were no dissenters.  There was great enthusiasm and excitement because of the location of the site.  We were told that valuation papers were tabled in the negotiations.  We made our decision based on the information before us.  It subsequently transpired, as a result of a freedom of information request, that there were no written valuation reports.  We were horrified as governors that we were told something based on a document that did not exist.  This is why we sought an independent inquiry.  This is why it is so important for me and the governing body to know whether we were misled or given the full facts when we made our decision.  We are entitled to expect if a proposal is coming from the president and deputy president of the university that all of the information in the memorandum and proposal is accurate.  This is what we are awaiting in the KPMG report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#C03300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Harney"},{"type":"speech","time":1652344200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>The KPMG report covers the information given to the governing authority and the subsequent process the university undertook to acquire the site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#C03400","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652344200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Deputy Devlin is right.

Essentially, what the investigation was to do was establish whether or not the correct information and the full information was put before the governing authority.  This is the purpose of the report.  That is why I said it to the Chair that nobody wants it more than me and the governing body.  I assure the committee that it comes up at every meeting as to why we cannot see the report and publish it and move on from the controversy.  It was a really good story.  When we got the site not only were we all excited in the university but it was very well received in Limerick that the university was going to come into the city and create a campus at that location.

On 5 May 2020, the president informed me he was going to resign because he said the virus impacted on his ability to serve the university.  I sought a date from when that would take effect because we were in the middle of a pandemic.  I pay tribute to the staff and students for the manner in which they adapted to the huge challenges of changing the way they worked and learned.  We were getting ready to open up, which was the intention in September, and I wanted to make sure we had a president during that very difficult and challenging period.<\/p> <p>  The then-president said he wanted to be paid for a year through his legal advisers.  Bizarrely, his contract had no notice period.  I took legal advice.  The current Minister, Deputy Harris, in a similar situation when the director general of the HSE was resigning, said in the D&aacute;il on 17 May 2018 that payment in lieu of notice is normal.  The Department was involved in a Supreme Court case way back in 1940, the Murphy case, and there is also Independent Newspapers and the Carey case in August 2003.  There is significant case law that suggests people are entitled to a payment in lieu of notice.<\/p> <p>  I obviously did not want to pay a year.  As we wanted to minimise that, negotiations took place between our external lawyers for the university and the former president's lawyers.  As part of that, and on advice, legal fees were paid, which were &euro;25,000 plus VAT.  All of that was approved by the governing authority, although not the amount of the legal fees because we were not quite certain of it at that point.  The governing authority approved the payment.  The president got four months in lieu of notice and two months' holidays.  He worked remotely until the end of August.  I wanted to be in a situation where we could appoint an interim president and have a competition for it, rather than anoint somebody.  That was obviously going to take some time over the summer.

That was identified as the preferred site but there was not a willing seller.  However, in April 2019 Dunnes approached the university and asked if we were still interested and the university said yes.  Negotiations took place between the university and Dunnes Stores.  My understanding from what the governing authority was told is that we made an opening offer of &euro;6.5 million.  Dunnes was looking for &euro;10 million and through the negotiations we settled on &euro;8 million.  That proposal was put to the governing authority and it unanimously supported that proposal.  In the context of that proposal the governing authority was told that valuation statements were advanced in those negotiations.  It subsequently transpired that there was no written valuation when a FOI request was submitted.  The governing authority was obviously concerned that there was no written valuation and that is why the KPMG inquiry was established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Harney"},{"type":"speech","time":1652344200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Was the value of the site flagged, as it is extremely concerning as &euro;8 million and &euro;3 million in terms of valuations------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#N00500","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652344200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>The point I make is that &euro;3 million is not a valuation.

I do not want to read it again but it is in the record here.  The people who carried out that valuation said it was desktop that they had not seen the property and they would need to have access to it and inspect it to know its potential from a planning point of view and then they would give a valuation in the context of a purchase or acquisition.

The former president informed me on 5 May that he wanted to resign because he was not able to carry out his duties because he was vulnerable to Covid.  I sought to get a date from the president.  He engaged through his lawyers and said he wanted a 12 month payment in lieu of notice.  Unfortunately his contract of employment had no notice period.  We took legal advice.  There is a lot of case law which I mentioned earlier.  Carey<i>v.<\/i>Independent Newspapers, Murphy <i>v.<\/i>Department of Education and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, in the context of the resignation of the director general of the HSE all upheld that in this kind of situation payment in lieu of notice is paid.  The negations took place between our lawyers and the lawyers for the former president.  They settled on a four-month payment in lieu of notice.  He got two months where he worked virtually.  Part of it was his holidays.  It was four months.  If it had been a severance payment he would have been entitled to over &euro;12,000 tax free.  We taxed it all.  If it had been a severance payment of course I would have consulted the Department.  That would never be an issue for somebody like me.  I would naturally follow the advice and do what was appropriate.  The Department spoke earlier.  We differ on this.  They say doctors differ and patients die.  Lawyers differ too.

Our first recommendation was that the report outlining the timeline and estimated costs for the completion of the national paediatric hospital be published as a matter of urgency.  We have requested sight of it on a number of occasions.  The response to the recommendation, which is not accepted, restates the board and the Department&rsquo;s position that the analysis is commercially sensitive and &ldquo;must remain confidential at this time, so as to ensure that the NPHDB&rsquo;s ability to enforce the contract is not prejudiced, and ultimately the project is not adversely affected.&rdquo;  In our latest correspondence with the Department on this topic, we asked for clarification as to whether the report could be provided to the committee on a confidential basis, and we await that clarification.<\/p> <p>  Our second recommendation, which was accepted, included a number of changes that will improve transparency in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board&rsquo;s accounts in respect of expenditure on this project, and that is welcome.<\/p> <p>  Our third recommendation was that future capital projects of this scale prioritise value for money, which was also accepted, and that a comprehensive review is carried out following completion of the project to ensure lessons are learned for future capital projects.  This is a requirement under the public spending code and will be done.<\/p> <p>  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

Again, the issue of commercial sensitivity in respect of the hospital is being cited as reason for not providing this committee with a report that was previously promised to us before its publication.  For the life of me I do not understand how if there is a contract in place, the publication of a report into that contract could result in commercial difficulties.  We have been in regular contact with the Department of Health in respect of this, but I propose that we write back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform asking it if it has an estimate of the final costing of the children's hospital and, if so, if it will share it with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051200002#GG00100","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1652344200,"counter":732,"content":"<p>The Chairman has stated that the committee recommends \"that a comprehensive review is carried out following completion of this project to ensure lessons are learned for future capital projects\".  We do not know what the timeline of this is, but it could be another couple of years before it is completed and we see the conclusion of this.  In the meantime, a similar project which was earmarked as costing &euro;300 million in 2017 is now being talked about as a project of the same scale costing &euro;1 billion, that is, the new national maternity hospital, which is equally mired in controversy about its site.  It is very difficult to see how lessons are learned if the project is completed before the other one starts.  How do we get even an interim understanding or some lessons?  The two-phase process is not similar, but how do we get some lessons we do not have to wait another five years for?  That is what it looks like.

It provides information requested by the committee regarding National Broadband Ireland's 2022 updated interim remedial plan.  The plan confirms a target of 102,000 premises passed by the end of contract year three, which is 31 January 2023.  The Secretary General states that \"under the contract, National Broadband Ireland is entitled to claim relief against its contractual obligations in circumstances where delays are due to circumstances beyond its control (such as the global pandemic)\".  The national broadband plan is approximately 12 months behind schedule, eight and a half of which are accepted by the Department, as Members will note in the correspondence, as beyond NBI's control.  It appears that sanctions will apply in respect of the other three and a half months.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I raised this over lunch break, when we had the opportunity to raise it with the Taoiseach.  It was not to get in before I said it at this meeting, but I pointed out to him and the officials from his Department the fact that at least three and a half months are not accepted as within NBI's control.  It is important a penalty is levied for that.  The Taoiseach committed to speaking to the Minister about it.  One of the reasons given in the correspondence relates to blocked ducts.  It can be expected when starting to push cables through existing duct that there will be problems and glitches.  Covid has been overplayed as a reason, as I have mentioned before.  In the first quarter of last year, 2021, NBI was on the ground working, as far as I could see.  If it was not, it should have been.  While progress would have slowed, there was a certain amount of work NBI could do.  It is important that we keep on with that and that, along with raising the matter with the Taoiseach, the committee writes back to the Department asking it to clarify if a penalty is now being levied for those three and a half months.  On page 3 of the correspondence it states, \"While these are addressed by the ... [updated interim remedial plan], sanctions are accruing against non-delivery of those Milestones.\"  That is what it says about non-delivery.  We should question that.

We were informed, if I recall correctly, that the target of 60,000 premises to be passed by March was still in place at the time of our hearing.  My understanding is that the most up-to-date figures we have received are that 41,000 premises or thereabouts were passed.  I think that those figures relate to last month and that only a little over 9,000 premises had actually been connected.  There is a problem here and, for the life of me, I do not understand why the Department is not live to that and reflecting the urgency of remedial actions in order to get this project back on track.  We have talked about the huge costs involved in this project and the number of communities that are desperately awaiting broadband.  The Government pursued this particular mechanism to deliver it and, clearly, NBI is not doing it in line with its own targets and milestones.  We need to keep on top of this issue, particularly in respect of the penalties, as you have mentioned, Chairman, and whether or not they are being applied or whether or not they can be applied.

We had a discussion last week with the Department of Finance and I asked a question in relation to the target of 100,000 EVs by 2030.  It is a nice round figure and I am always very wary of round figures.  Apparently the Department of Transport provided that figure but there does not appear to have been a robust exchange between the Departments of Finance and Transport on the ability to achieve that target but we will end up paying fines if we do not achieve it.  That is the point I was making last week, that it will come back on the Department's budget.

It is incorrect to suggest that the constitution of the national maternity hospital, NMH, would have to be revisited every time a new treatment or procedure becomes legally permissible.<\/p> <p>  The phrase &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; is a major red flag.  Providing healthcare on the basis of this test removes autonomy from women and gives the sole decision-making capacity to doctors.  These words qualify access to services and enshrine justification for refusing legally permissible treatments.<\/p> <p>  I attach a letter sent on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, which is a perfect example of &ldquo;clinically required&rdquo; in action and that phrase is interchangeable in medical practice with \"clinically appropriate\" in denying patients legally permissible services.  In a reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister of Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, it was stated, &ldquo;St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital has carried out sterilisation procedures when it is clinically required to do so ..., but not for the exclusive purpose of sterilisation.&rdquo; <\/p> <p>  NMH clinicians who say terminations take place at St. Vincent&rsquo;s must confirm if those are under the terms of the 2018 Act or for clinical indication to save a patient&rsquo;s life. The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly&rsquo;s response to the parliamentary question confirms that fewer than five such terminations occurred before October 2021 and that routine terminations do not happen at St. Vincent&rsquo;s.<\/p> <p>  The original plan to co-locate the NMH as an independent stand-alone hospital at Elm Park has been shredded.  The NMH would be one of four hospitals owned by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, SVHG, which in turn is wholly owned by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings. <\/p> <p>  On 29 May 2017, the chair of the board of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, insisted, after the Sisters had announced their intention to depart, that the move of NMH to the SVHG site will proceed only on the basis of existing agreements that give ownership and control of the new hospital to SVHG.  That intent has been achieved under the current proposals.<\/p> <p>  The existing National Maternity Hospital would cease to exist, but the mechanisms to do this have not yet commenced.  The NMH governors have not yet been asked to vote for the dissolution of the 1903 charter, nor the required Act of the Oireachtas passed.  NMH staff would be employed by an NMH designated activity company, DAC, whose board would have minority NMH representation and be subsidiary to SVHG.   The master would be relegated to one clinical director of four in the group.  SVHG would own 99 NMH DAC shares.  The Minister of the day would have one share.  The NMH would have none.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s would nominate one third of members of the NMH DAC board, as well as the chair of that board on a rotating basis every three out of nine years.<\/p><p>There would only be three national maternity hospital directors, one of whom would be the master, as opposed to reporting to the board.  For example, the CEO of the HSE is not a board member.  There is no security against a future conservative Minister for Health appointing three conservative State directors.  This is not independence.  I should add that I think the golden share is more of a liability than an asset.<\/p><p> The HSE&rsquo;s business case is undergoing review by the Department of Health as part of new rules to prevent a repeat of the huge overrun in the budget of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I am reliably informed that the HSE is unable to put a final figure on the cost but believes it is rising by more than &euro;10 million every month.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s spending audit has not been completed.  Delays to the project have been caused by St. Vincent&rsquo;s withdrawing co-operation between 2014 and 2016, during which there were three mediation processes, of which the first two failed; delay in the Sisters of Charity completing the three stages of their alienation, that is, Canon Law application, civil law registration and HSE approval; and delay in producing the complicated legal documents which were released recently.  There is also a risk associated with committing a flagship hospital to a catchment area of south County Dublin and the east coast for 299 years when the demographic evidence shows higher birth numbers in north and west Dublin and the surrounding counties.<\/p><p> In the last few years, there has been impressive investment in Holles Street, with a new labour suite, new neonatal intensive care unit, operating theatres, emergency room, foetal medicine unit and upgrading of post-natal wards.  Patient satisfaction is at 95% and clinical outcomes are on a par with the best in the world.  The current proposals are flawed.  In view of deep public and political disquiet, more time is needed to get this project right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I propose to look specifically at the network of papers released by the HSE approximately a week ago.  I will not deal with the larger question of value for money and whether the State ought to make transfers.  Rather, I would like to look at what would be the most positive outcome that could be obtained if the proposal, as currently put forward, were to go ahead.  I will also look at whether any suggestions could be made which would deliver the outcome which everybody has been at one in seeking, namely, a modern, high-end maternity, neonatal and obstetric hospital that will deliver the services to the women, children and patients for the next 299 years, the period we have to deal with.<\/p> <p>  I will first address a question that has been the focus of considerable attention, that is, the ownership of the new maternity hospital building.  I watched the discussions yesterday and the submissions on this matter.  Unfortunately, I did not see all of them.  One has to deal with clients as well.  By the end of those discussions, there was a fairly clear position that the State is going to have a leasehold interest in the building and that the first scheduled definition of the lease sets out that any buildings erected or to be erected thereon and together with all additions alterations and improvements from time to time thereto or thereon will belong to the landlord, that is, the property which will be transferred by way of a lease - the leasehold interest.  The HSE will have a leasehold interest but will never own it outright.  The lease includes covenants which control the use of the property and the national maternity hospital company's constitution provides for the landlord to nominate three of its directors.  This is a relationship between the leaseholder and the landlord, which is much more intimate and there is much more involvement by the landlord than one might see, for example, in a question of a ground rent or a similar situation.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I wish to address is the question of what uses the HSE can put this hospital to and how they are defined.  The permitted use to which the HSE can put the new hospital is defined in the lease as follows: &ldquo;In relation to the National Maternity Hospital Area [we will return to that shortly] as a public hospital primarily for the provision of all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services, including research, by a maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics and neonatal hospital, and a range of related health services in the community and any other public healthcare service or services\".  This creates a two-step test for any permitted use of the hospital.  One should recognise that this is in the lease and therefore is a granting of a permission by the landlord to the tenant.  It is a restriction, rather than an instruction.  The restriction is that it can only be where the use is, first, clinically appropriate and, second, legally permissible.  The first of those two tests, I will argue, is both unnecessary and problematic.  It is perfectly correct to keep a legally permissible test and there is no ambiguity as to what that phrase means but unfortunately there is no definition of the phrase \"clinically appropriate\" within the lease to which one could turn to see what it is that was intended by the parties.  There is, therefore, an ambiguity created.<\/p> <p>  On RT&Eacute;'s \"Prime Time\" earlier this week, Holles Street hospital's legal adviser, Ms Murphy, said she was originally very pleased at the insertion of the phrase \"clinically appropriate\" into the agreement document and then said, \"We did not foresee that this would be taken and flipped.\"  My argument is not for any one particular interpretation of the phrase \"clinically appropriate\".  My argument is that there are multiple interpretations possible and it is the fact that those multiple interpretations are possible that creates the problem.  This is an undefined term.  Once you have an undefined or ambiguous term, it becomes a source not of constructive ambiguity as we might imagine from the political world - we are all familiar with that idea from the Good Friday Agreement - but, rather, the reason that terms in legal documents are so tightly defined is to ensure absolute clarity between all the parties.  An area where there is an undefined term, the meaning of which is going to be discovered later, is an area where we can anticipate problems into the future between the parties.<\/p> <p>  Ambiguity results in unexpected, unwanted and sometimes even perverse-seeming interpretations being placed on disputed phrases.  The Minister has said this phrase was introduced at the request of the HSE.  It is my intention to be as constructive as possible throughout my submission and one of the things that I wish to say is that this is very good news.  Were the phrase to be introduced by the counter-party, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, it is possible there might be difficulties in removing it.  If the State realised this is going to cause a problem, it could cause a difficulty once you have constructed an agreement, where the other side has asked for something to be put in, it will cause difficulties if the counter-party asked for it to be taken out.  Here, however, I am proposing that the State should deal with the question of ambiguity that has inadvertently been introduced by the State's side.  There should, therefore, be no difficulty in removing it without damaging the deal.  I believe the State should do this.  If the phrase is not removed, it should be defined by way of a list of controversial procedures which are presented as \"including but not limited to\", that is to say, a non-exclusive and non-exhaustive list of potential procedures.  This allows for the evolution of medical technology and medical processes in the future.  It does not limit those processes but, at the same time, it distinctly and explicitly addresses all those areas where there may be concerns at the moment as to whether certain services will be available immediately and, perhaps much more importantly, in the future. <\/p> <p>  To address the constitution of the new national maternity hospital company, the new company which is going to run the fresh, new national maternity hospital sets out its principal object at section 3.1 of the constitution.  It states that the principal object for which the company is established is \"the promotion of health, in particular by the provision of all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services, including research, by a maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics and neonatal hospital, and a range of related health services in the community.\"  One can see that the constitution of the hospital has been drafted in such a way as to directly mirror the phraseology in the lease.  This means the company&rsquo;s officers are bound to perform only such activities that meet the two-step test, namely, clinically appropriate and legally permissible.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has a golden share where he can oblige directors to take action if they do not provide any and all legally permissible healthcare services.<\/p><p>The \"golden share\" clause in section 5 of the constitution does not require that they be both legally permissible and clinically appropriate.  The Minister's golden share clause only requires that they be legally permissible.  That is strong wording and a very valuable power to give to the Minister.  It really moves the deal forward from the previous test included in the Mulvey agreement.  Unfortunately, the Minister's golden share may only be exercised in compliance with the two-step test set out in the principal object.  The reason for this is that it forms part of the reserved powers of the national maternity hospital's constitution.  All of the reserved powers are explicitly stated to be \"exclusively subsidiary and ancillary to the principal object\".  <\/p><p> To step back from all of that, which is like trying to eat a bowl of spaghetti all in one go, what we have is a series of layers of duties that are to be performed by the hospital; a series of requirements the hospital must meet in performing its principal object, its purpose; and a series of restrictions put on the hospital's usage by the lease.  All of those restrictions include the test of clinical appropriateness and legal permissibility.  Because the Minister's golden share is subsidiary and ancillary to the principal object, which is to say that it can only be exercised within that two-step framework, it has been placed too far down the stacked hierarchy of rights and obligations to be able to overrule a challenge to action based on any future interpretation of the phrase \"clinically appropriate\" in the principal object clause of the new national maternity hospital company's constitution.  <\/p><p> I will deal with the matter of costs very briefly because, while it was the subject of discussion yesterday, I do not think it is the subject of controversy any more.  The rent is set at &euro;850,000 per year in the lease.  There is a rent review every ten years.  The rent is abated to &euro;10 if the tenant follows conditions on the use of the premises.  In the event the tenant does not follow the conditions placed upon the use of the premises, the abatement is lost and the rent returns to &euro;850,000 a year.  The tenant here will be the HSE and the new national maternity hospital.  Those conditions include a requirement that the tenant not use the premises for any purpose that does not meet the test of clinical appropriateness.  So, not only is there a principal object set out and a requirement in the permitted use clause of the lease that services must be clinically appropriate, but also built into the lease is a kind of penalty clause with regard to any activities that are not clinically appropriate, as interpreted by a future set of company directors.  <\/p><p> I should stress again that all of this is going to go on for 299 years.  That is the term of this hospital lease.  There is a requirement under the lease that a hospital, whether the initial building or any future buildings that replace it, will provide services of this sort for the next 299 years.  To give the committee a sense of what kind of scope that is, 299 years ago a Medici was being made a duke of Tuscany.  I thank Wikipedia for its knowledge.  That is a very long time ago and, given the enormous changes that have swept society just in Ireland in those 299 years, we can imagine that there will be even more sweeping changes over the next 299 years given the pace of technology.  Despite this, we must consider whether there is sufficient security and certainty in these documents to ensure delivery of the services of that maternity hospital in the manner intended for that very long period.  That means that the rules of the hospital, of the agreement and of the relationship between the hospital and the maternity hospital should be written down together and defined as tightly as possibly so that the agreement will not lead to ambiguity in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we are eating into the members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#C00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I will roll through the last two points very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I was going to suggest that we take the statement as read, if Mr. McGarr would like.

As regards the primary solutions that are available, the Minister acknowledged that for the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to gift or sell to the State the land upon which the hospital will be built is the optimum solution.  Until very recently, the owners of that land were bound by Vatican rules regarding the disposal of assets.  Those rules tied their hands.  The new owners are independent and not tied by those requirements and restrictions.  It presents a chance for a fresh start on that question that there is a new and completely independent owner of the site that is not bound by Canon Law.  It is worth returning to that question.<\/p> <p>  However, the key point that I want to stress is that, if the phrase \"clinically appropriate\" were to be deleted from the governing clauses of each of the documents and the descriptions of what may be provided for within the next 299 years, this would, in itself, provide enormous certainty.  It would mean that everything that is legally permissible would be allowed to be delivered in this hospital.

His company was a finalist in the category of personal injury-medical negligence law firm of the year and it specialises in medical negligence, personal injury, probate and employment law.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Boylan and I share many objectives.  He gave his very valuable time to the cross-party group that had concerns about this, of which I was a member.  I thank him for giving his valuable time.  We also share an interest in women's health and we were on the same side on the eighth amendment.  I share the sentiments the Minister expressed yesterday in relation to the history of the treatment of Irish women in health terms, not just by the church but also the State, over the past 100 years or so.  I have had concerns, as Dr. Boylan has, over the past year.  I have been following this matter closely and Dr. Boylan made his time available to us and to me, personally, and I am grateful for that too.<\/p> <p>  I will go through some of Dr. Boylan's statements and start with Mary Aikenhead and how St. Vincent's companies being obliged to uphold the values of other Mary Aikenhead organisations.  It is not to uphold the Catholic doctrine but the values of Mary Aikenhead, which are human dignity, compassion, justice, equality and advocacy.  Nobody can argue with any of those.<\/p><p>Poor Mary Aikenhead died in 1858.  The church's formal position on abortion was established about 15 years later.  I do not think Dr. Boylan can say it is not credible that she would envisage procedures such as termination or sterilisation.  I do not think that we can credibly attribute what Mary Aikenhead would have thought on this.  My view on that is as valid as Dr. Boylan's.  He said that it is not credible that these values, including the provision of services such as elective abortion, are directly contradictory to Catholic teaching.  The Vatican papers are like something out of \"The Da Vinci Code\".  What vehicle does Dr. Boylan see the Vatican using to impose Catholic doctrine on a State-owned and State-run hospital, which has a constitution that insists not only that these services should be available but also that they must be available?

The hospital is linked up by corridors.  The theatres, in the design, are all on the same corridor.  The numbers of deliveries in maternity hospitals vary from time to time.  The numbers in Holles Street have gone down by 25% in recent years, while those in the Rotunda have gone up significantly.  The numbers in 2020 were as low as they were in 1994.  One could envisage a situation where there are empty rooms in the national maternity hospital and the theatres are not being used, say on a weekend when there are no routine gynaecological procedures.  What is predictable is that St. Vincent's is overflowing with people on trolleys in the emergency room and the corridors.  Adjoining that are empty rooms in the national maternity hospital.  Then there is the board structure.  There are three from St. Vincent's, as well as three ministerial appointees who will be under political pressure not to have overcrowding in St. Vincent's Hospital while there are empty rooms nearby in a hospital whose operating company is owned by St. Vincent's.  One can easily see how there would be seepage from St. Vincent's into the national maternity hospital space.  If that triggers the &euro;850,0000 per year or gives rise to conflict, the Minister is the person who will sort it out.

It was not in the original Mulvey plan and is one of the methods by which the State side has attempted to alleviate the concerns which were clear at the time the Mulvey report came out, when it was to be owned by the nuns.  It was through the holding company, but the nuns were the ultimate owners of the building and hospital.  The golden share was created to deal with that problem.  I do not see that problem arising in many other sets of circumstances.  I would be surprised if the same kind of solution was proposed for other HSE hospitals, for example.  The golden share is intended to be able to tell the directors to provide for legally permissible services.  That is what it says in section 5.3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Minister... hold[s] a share referred to as the Golden Share... provide[s] legal protection to the inviolability of the Reserved Powers in the manner provided for in this Constitution, to ensure... the obligations of the Directors as contained in [the] Constitution are complied with and to ensure that any maternity, gynaecological, obstetrics and\/or neonatal services which are lawfully available in the State shall be available in the New NMH.  <\/blockquote> <p>The Minister probably read out the same phrase yesterday.  It is a strong phrase to underpin the delivery of lawfully permitted services.  It is not qualified by saying &quot;lawfully permitted and clinically appropriate&quot;. It is unqualified.  Unfortunately, it is only in relation to the reserve powers and only goes so far as those powers are able to go.  The reserve powers are subject to that clinically appropriate and lawfully permissible test.  I am not advancing a particular interpretation as being accurate.  I am advancing the position, which I think has been self-evident over the past week, that it is ambiguous.  There are a number of interpretations that could be placed on it, depending on one's point of view.  That is in respect of now and of people with a shared set of life experiences and does not account for what might happen in ten, 15, 20 or 100 years' time. <br\/><br\/>The suggestion by the Minister that it would be defined is good and important if it is to be left in but, at the moment, a good reason to leave it in has not been advanced.  It is clear from the golden share that the Minister's intention is to deliver all lawfully available services.  He is not looking to have these things clinically appropriate and lawfully available.  The HSE is the source of its imposition in the deal but it is within the gift of the State to decide not to go ahead with it.  Rather than creating a problem by including a list of definitions which are non-exclusive and asking everybody whether this and that is okay, surely the correct response would be to remove the controversial clause, for which there is not the need that there is for the other definitions.  The reason given is that it is needed to ensure only maternity hospital services are provided but the permitted use clause at the top of the constitution says it is for legally permissible healthcare services by a maternity, gynaecological, obstetrics and neonatal hospital.  If the purpose of &quot;clinically permissible&quot; is to say it is for national maternity hospital usage, it is a redundancy and is saying the same thing twice.  If it is a redundancy that puts the future interpretation of all the protections in the agreement at risk, the correct response is to take it out, as the preference, and, only as second best, to attempt to define it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":910,"content":"<p>Someone was on saying the fact \"clinically appropriate\" is missing is a drafting issue and they are now saying it was supposed to be there.

Dr. Boylan had started on that point but he did not have a full opportunity to discuss how, for example, the master of the hospital will report to the board and how the board has a role in health policy.  I would like it if Dr. Boylan would comment on that question of how \"clinically appropriate\" might be applied.  For example, I know there was a suggestion of providing a list of different practices but \"clinically appropriate\" is not simply a matter of what services are available; it relates to when they might be made available.  He gave the example that in St. Vincent's University Hospital at present sterilisation procedures are given when they are clinically required in relation to another health issue, but not for the purpose of sterilisation itself.

As I said, the composition of the board has three separate groups of three nominees.  The three from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group are committed to upholding the values and vision of Mother Mary Frances Aikenhead, which are undoubtedly Catholic.  If you have a conservative Minister for Health who appoints three people who are conservative they may well define \"clinically appropriate\" in a way which restricts the access of women to healthcare that they are perfectly entitled to.  The term \"clinically appropriate\" allows for a qualification or a jump that must be made in order for women to access care, which is legal but which may not be interpreted as clinically appropriate by the board, and you may well get a conservative master as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>Mr. McGarr might confirm that there are tests for both \"clinically appropriate\" and \"legally permissible\".

It is the case that this lease is almost there.  My proposal is to delete the references to the ambiguous phrase of \"clinically appropriate\" and leave it be that the matter would stand as it states in the lease.  These would be services to be delivered in a national maternity, obstetric, gynaecology and neonatal hospital.  Everyone supports that.  Only the services that are lawfully permissible should go ahead.  That is my proposition as the second best option if the land cannot be owned freehold, which everyone else agrees would be preferable if it were possible.

I wish him, the Deputies and Senators a good evening and I thank them for the opportunity to meet with them to discuss this vital national healthcare project that has already been delayed for far too long.<\/p> <p>  As a practising clinician and Master of the National Maternity Hospital, I am proud to work in a hospital that has led the way in ensuring women can avail of all their legal rights.<\/p> <p>  Although the debate has focused on the right to access gender affirming surgery, tubal ligation, termination of pregnancy and artificial reproductive techniques, we should not forget that last year we delivered 7,855 babies to 7,694 mothers.  We had 79,750 attendances in our antenatal clinics and 10,000 attendances in our gynaecology outpatients, all in the cramped, inadequate, antiquated, unfit for purpose buildings in Holles Street.<\/p><p>It has been difficult to hear claims both in the media and in this room that our fervent support for the proposed move to Elm Park is some kind of surrender to the church.  Legitimate concerns are welcome and deserve every consideration but we must also deal in facts, and I am alarmed by the combination of emotive misinformation and misunderstanding that prevails.  Just because the contracts underpinning the new hospital appear complex, that does not indicate the church stealing influence over women's reproductive choices through clever contractual stealth.  I appreciate members of this committee are holding these hearings in an effort to bring clarity to the issues and I hope that this evening, along with my colleagues, we can allay some of the fears that exist.<\/p><p> Having spent much time listening to the debate over the past week, I believe four key points remain.  The first is the clinical imperative.  Although the undisputed need for relocation has been stated many times, lest we forget in the maelstrom of irrelevancies, I will continue to remind members that we want to provide advanced level care in an appropriate setting where women and their babies can be afforded the dignity and privacy they deserve.  This can only be provided in a new purpose-built maternity, gynaecology and neonatal hospital.  For anybody to describe the current location as fit for purpose or to argue the definition of a Nightingale ward, where 14 patients are separated by curtains, with very limited toilet and shower facilities, it is clear that he or she has not been in the hospital for some time and cannot have the best interest of our patients at heart.  Women should have single en suite rooms for antenatal, labour and postnatal stays, unless otherwise indicated.  Current investment reflects a Band-Aid approach to a gaping wound.<\/p><p> The second point for mention is ethos.  The NMH, as a public voluntary hospital, has no constraints on the procedures it offers patients, and I can say with absolute certainty this will continue when we relocate.  The hospital will remain a clinically independent, publicly funded, self-governed organisation with a board composed of nine directors, each with a fiduciary duty to the National Maternity Hospital and a shareholder split, with the most important share - the golden share - belonging to the Minister for Health of the day.<\/p><p> It would a sad day if the unambiguously supportive views of 52 senior consultants in a letter to the Taoiseach last February were to be drowned out in the public debate by relentless claims that services offered at the new hospital will be curtailed by religious ethos.<\/p><p> The third point relates to ownership.  There is another misplaced fear that, as owner of the freehold, St Vincent's will have control over the operations of the new national maternity hospital.  I had a conversation recently with an expert in property law, who is removed from the project, who stated a 300-year leasehold conveys effective ownership or freehold equivalent and is an ownership form used across both the city and country for campus developments where there is mixed use or ownership.  The expert gave me a number of examples, including IDA parks, colleges, Dublin Airport, the Central Bank at Dublin Landings, Capital Dock and Connolly Quarter.  Many of these developments have been funded by the State.  The National Maternity Hospital, along with many other hospitals, is an example of leasehold.<\/p><p> The final point relates to trust.  Why should women and their families trust instruments of the State such as politicians, the religious or the health service, having been let down so appallingly in the past?  Why should they listen to a male master of the National Maternity Hospital tell them that all will be well?  They should not just believe me.  They should listen to the women who were powerful advocates for women's right to choice, such as Mary Higgins, Mary Brosnan, and the many other clinicians who signed the letter we recently sent from the National Maternity Hospital to the Taoiseach.  They should listen to the 400 plus clinicians who signed a letter to the Taoiseach from all hospitals, who work in all specialties, general practice and public health from around the country - and even a colleague of mine who is based in London - who have written to support the proposed move to St. Vincent's.<\/p><p> Currently, approximately 84%of trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country are young women, including my daughter.  All those asked have indicated their support for the project.  These will be the future of our speciality, many of them consultants in the NMH at Elm Park, service users themselves of the new facility, many of them advocates in the repeal campaign, who recently wrote a letter from the Junior Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynaecological Society, JOGS, of the Institute of Obstetricians &amp;amp; Gynaecologists, supporting the project and the move and stating they had no concerns about it.  I and my medical colleagues and those in midwifery and nursing in the NMH would not sign up to a proposal that was not going to 100% guarantee the new hospital's integrity and independence.  The reality of failure, due to doubts which need no longer exist, is to turn your back on the urgent needs of Irish women, girls and their children whom my colleagues and I have the privilege of caring for.  I look forward to answering the questions of members as fully and completely as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Shane Higgins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1305,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Higgins very much.

One of the reasons he says that is due to the use of the term \"permitted use\".  He says there are restrictions on what can be done within the hospital because of that clause in the lease.

The solicitor, Mr. Simon McGarr, has pointed to a schedule to the lease which says that the land here and all the buildings that are erected on it belong to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The schedule does indeed say that.  The lease then goes on to say that the landlord gives away the land and the buildings for a period of 299 years.  Whether or not you regard this as ownership would appear to be a matter of perspective.  Some disagree that a 299-year lease is ownership.  I disagree with them.  It was referred to earlier that a minimum period of 70 years is required to be legally considered as ownership.  We have here 299 years.

It would be very remiss of us not to hear from the very people who are now the landowners and who now hold all of the cards.

I think the Deputy said that St. Vincent&rsquo;s could merge with another healthcare organisation.  This raises a point which bears repeating, even though we have all discussed it.  There is a conflation here of ownership and control.  I believe that the Deputy&rsquo;s question derives from the fact that St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is the owner.  However, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is not in control of the new national maternity hospital company.  It cannot therefore direct a merger.  There is no mechanism for it to do that.  We have all talked about the other hospitals in the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, of which there are three.  They are all housed in one company.  The national maternity hospital in the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is housed in a separate company, which is specifically designed to ensure that there is no outside interference, whether this is by way of merger with another hospital or by way of religious interference.  There is no mechanism in the document or rulebook, which is the constitution of the new national maternity hospital.  This new national maternity hospital company is a registered charity.  It is bound by its own principal object, or the reason it exists, which is for the promotion of health and, in particular, for the provision of maternity and associated services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#V01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1332,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#V01900","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1333,"content":"<p>That is my answer to the first question.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s point about the appointment of conservative directors feeds into the same point.  There has been a worry, which is legitimate - I do not want to suggest that any of the worries and concerns are anything other than legitimate - that three directors from St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, three directors from the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street or three directors from the State might decide to take this company in a different direction.  It was stated earlier that the directors could change the constitution of the company.  That was not an accurate statement.  I feel the need to correct the record in that regard.  In the rulebook or constitution of the new company there is a set of powers for the board.  They are the board&rsquo;s directive.  They say how this hospital is going to be run.  They are only capable of being amended with the consent of the Charities Regulator, as was stated, but also with the unanimous consent of every single director, and of the Minister for Health.  That statement is to correct the record.<\/p> <p>  My last legal point is in relation to the point about a conservative director who might take the company in a particular direction.  Yes, boards of directors do influence culture in organisations, but boards of directors under the Companies Act and under the Charities Act have very clear obligations to act in the best interest of this company and to promote its charitable purpose.  It is not possible for directors to go outside of the rulebook, which is the constitution.  There are two sets of laws, the Companies Act and the Charities Act, imposed upon them to act with due skill and care, in the best interests of this company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#V02000","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1334,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Deputy that I only remember one of the questions.

However, Deputy Lahart&rsquo;s question is valid.  Numbers are one thing, but complexity of care is another.

She can talk about the number or referrals that we get.  We get a significant number of referrals for foetal medicines.  These are labour intensive and expertise intensive.

He has got it wrong.  I was a young woman in the early 1980s.  I had an abortion at that time and had to go to Liverpool for it.  I campaigned against the eighth amendment as a young woman and then lived through the years that saw the darkest of things done to women, from what happened in the Kerry babies case to Savita Halappanavar.  That runs deep because of what is at the base of it.  I do not know if Professor Higgins has read Emily O'Reilly's wonderful book <i>Masterminds of the Right<\/i>in which she traces succinctly the shadowy forces that brought in that referendum and, later, the Maastricht protocol, which stopped abortion coming into our country.  They did not wear habits and were not traipsing around corridors with veils on them; they were top officials linked to organisations like Opus Dei and the Knights of St. Columbanus.  They were deeply embedded in the health service and the Civil Service and they saw to it that Ireland maintained an extraordinary conservative agenda in relation to women's reproductive rights.  We have broken from that but people like me, though probably not so much the younger generation who did not live through it, have a bitter taste in our mouths.  We want to see a national maternity hospital fully owned and run by the State.<\/p><p>I dispute what has been said about it being owned according to the lease.  It is not my dispute.  It can be seen in the St. Vincent's fact sheet.  I have read the details into the record of the D&aacute;il.  It disputes what has been said.  It asks who owns the land the new national maternity hospital will be built on and it states:  &quot;The land is owned by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.&quot;  Who will run the hospital?  The hospital will be run as part of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  We have spent the week teasing out these questions.  We have got some clarity on some things but not on many more.<\/p><p>I am delighted to hear Professor Higgins say he would welcome the introduction of a definition into those documents in respect of the worrying clause relating to &quot;clinically appropriate&quot;.  We worry about that.  Who says whether it is appropriate that somebody has sterilisation or an abortion?  Who says it is appropriate how they have their baby?  If it is not the woman and she does not have a say, then who is telling her what to do with her body?  I hope Professor Higgins accepts that as bona fide.  I think the world of St. Vincent's and of these doctors.  I met Dr. Walsh the other night in the RT&Eacute; studio.  I have nothing against the witnesses.  This is not personal, but they have to understand where it stems from.  It is totally legitimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#W02000","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1357,"content":"<p>I apologise.

We missed a portion of the earlier session because we were in transit, so if I am not in the right domain the Senator is free to correct me.<\/p> <p>  The right of first refusal clause in the lease means that, and this is a very unlikely scenario but we have included it for absolute clarity and to protect the State, if St. Vincent's proposed to dispose of the land and wanted to transfer its freehold ownership to a third party it convenants, which means it promises or undertakes, to offer the HSE the first refusal.  St. Vincent's deciding to exit healthcare is extremely unlikely territory, but we wanted to have all bases covered.  If that event occurs the option agreement is triggered, and the content of the option agreement is to allow the HSE the right to be the first person.  Now, the HSE might say it does not want it either, but if the HSE wants to become the freehold owner it has the first refusal right.<\/p> <p>  The mortgage is slightly earlier at clause 6.4.  There are two steps to this analysis.  I do not think we got into this yesterday so the Senator is free to tell me if I am not in the right domain.  The first question is: does the landlord have an ability to secure a mortgage over the site?  The second question, and for me it is the much more pertinent question, is: what would that mean for the HSE, the tenant?  There is an ability, a technical one, for the landlord to mortgage the site, but the landlord has no real interest so I do not believe it could or would ever practically occur, but the ability is there to mortgage the site.  The mortgage, if there is one, can have no effect on the rights given to the HSE.  The HSE's right to own the building for the 299 years is a superior right and, effectively, would trump any right.

St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is a registered charity and because of that it has a legal obligation to get value for its asset, unless it is applying the asset to another charitable purpose.  In plain language, what that means is that one charity can give to another charity something for free, if the other charity is doing something the same as the first, that is, the charitable delivery of healthcare.  If the other body, however, decided to commercialise the asset, say by building an apartment block, then St. Vincent's could not allow that other party to build such an apartment block and make a great deal of money from doing so for free.  Therefore, St. Vincent's and its advisers were quite right in saying it was a registered charity and that it had to show it was looking after the asset and only giving it for the &euro;10 rent annually if the site is used to run a public maternity hospital.  It was necessary to state that if that was not being done anymore, then it would be necessary to increase the rent to &euro;850,000.  That is to comply with charity law and, I believe, for no other reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#Y01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1393,"content":"<p>This provision is to ensure that the buildings on the site will be operated as a charity in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#Y01300","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>Yes, as a national maternity hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#Y01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1395,"content":"<p>Regarding the scenario proposed earlier, involving a situation where one hospital started taking in an overflow of patients, does Ms Murphy think that would trigger this clause?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051200002#Y01500","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1396,"content":"<p>No.  That is still public healthcare.

Ms Murphy mentioned the fact of the hospital clause.  Again, actually, nobody has disputed that as the permitted use.  I refer to a maternity, gynaecological and obstetrical municipal hospital.  The particular issue highlighted was the phrase \"clinically appropriate\".  I would appreciate our guests commenting on this aspect, in respect of their preference regarding its removal or definition.  If we have a definition, then I am concerned that it will not simply be a matter of which services are provided, but of which services and when they are provided.  I say that because it is one of the key concerns we have.  For example, I refer to a situation where certain services may be theoretically available, but perhaps not practically available because of a particular policy or ethos or clinical direction.  I would like to hear our guests' preferences in this regard.  I refer to references to \"all clinical\" services and it being read that way by our guests.  The fact that it was read this way is already a strong signal that there is an issue with this aspect.  I refer to lawyers reading these documents and understanding them completely differently, as well as the legal line in the next few years.<\/p> <p>  Regarding any building, any hospital, on the premises, is it not the case that it will be the property of St. Vincent's holding group in 299 years?  Is it also not the case, because we have this obligation, and it has been taken on, to continue to build a hospital - and Deputy Shortall asked about the business case in this context earlier - and therefore we are looking at a situation whereby there will be four or five successive maternity hospitals to be built on the site, with the accompanying costs from doing so?  Is it not the case in that context that we would revert to a market rent of &euro;850,000, perhaps in 70 years' time?  It was mentioned that it was felt it would be time to move on in this context in 100 years.

It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  <\/p> <p>  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to him or her identifiable.

I apologise for not being able to make it in person.  Advances in reproductive technologies present challenges to us all.<\/p><p>Medical advances and new technologies have plunged mental health professionals and legal professionals into ethical and psychological quandaries that were unimagined prior to the birth of Louise Brown, the firstborn IVF baby, in 1978.<\/p><p> For nearly a century, the world of psychology believed that the welfare of children was best served in a family where a child lived with two biological heterosexual parents.  This view has been challenged by recent advancements in technology, which have invited us all to embrace a much wider and more inclusive definition of \"family\".  Psychology has been playing catch-up with medical advances, and all of the advances in thinking need to be enshrined in our legislation.<\/p><p> Mental health professionals have voiced many concerns but, over time, the longitudinal studies in the areas of surrogacy and other assisted technologies have allayed some of these.  I will briefly set out some of the concerns psychologists had when these technologies became more widely available.  Would the array of new family forms impact negatively on parent-child relationships and children's psychological development?  Would children with surrogate mothers have some sense of having two mothers, which might then impact on their attachment to their social-biological mothers?  Would some of the challenges that arise in adoption arise with surrogacy?  In 2011, Dr. David Brodzinsky highlighted that secrecy about origins and non-disclosure of adoption were associated with poorer outcomes for adopted children.  This prompted concerns about how information about assisted conceptions might be imparted to children.  Would these families be stigmatised or marginalised by societal norms and culture if there was an ethos of disclosure?  How could legislation respect the child's right to his or her history and identity and ensure marginalisation was not a feature?  How could best practice in the provision of transparency and access to records be ensured?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe Nic Dhomhnaill","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652310000,"counter":1425,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1426,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but there was a little interference.

I believe Professor Susan Golombok and Dr. Vasanti Jadva will be appearing before the committee in a couple of weeks' time.  They have undertaken extensive research and longitudinal studies in this area.  I will reference their 2012, 2015 and 2017 studies.  They have addressed many of the concerns that psychologists and other mental health professionals might have had.  In a longitudinal study, they followed four groups of children: egg donation families; gamete donation families; 42 children born through surrogacy; and a control group.  The families were studied when the children were aged one year, two years, three years, seven years, ten years and 14 years.  They referred to this as the sixth phase of their longitudinal study.<\/p> <p>  Their research findings were heartening.  At all ages, attachment measures - child-parent relationship measures - supported that children born into any of the assisted reproductive technology, ART, groups rated slightly better on attachment measures than the families in the control group.  Part of this good early attachment was put down to the fact that these were very wanted children.  The absence of a gestational connection did not interfere with development of positive parent-child relationships.  Fathers were slightly less involved at the one year mark in the sperm donation group, but this difference was no longer evident when the children were three years old.  In the surrogacy group, there was slight dip in measures of children's psychological adjustment at seven years of age.  This was to be expected, as it is at this time that children develop an awareness of the biology of reproduction.  At seven years of age, less than 50% in the ART donor groups had told their children about their conception.  In the surrogacy group, almost all parents had told their children.  At the one year mark, 90% of families were still in contact with surrogate mothers.  At ten years, 60% were in touch.  The failure to tell children was generally related to parents' fear of othering their children.<\/p> <p>  The concerns regarding the legal position of children born through surrogacy needs to be addressed urgently.  Interestingly, an eminent psychologist in this area - Dr. Mali Mann - made a Freudian slip in a paper she was presenting a number of years ago.  In so doing, though, she coined the terms \"birth other\" and \"biological other\", clearly defining the social mother as the person with the mothering function.  Donors and surrogates had an \"other than mothering\" function.  We urgently need legislation to protect the relationship these children have with their functioning mothers and to afford them all the legal privileges, inheritance rights and so on afforded children who are not born through surrogacy.  The State needs to legislate to ensure existing children and all future children have access to their histories and identities.  In some extreme situations, access to the history of two donors and one surrogate may be required.  The legislation needs to be agile so that future technologies, whatever they may be, can be accommodated.<\/p> <p>  The preponderance of research in adoption and surrogacy studies points to the value of full disclosure.  Children's responses to being told vary from interested and curious to totally disinterested.  They are seldom distressed.  When children are introduced at a young age to information about their parentage, outcomes are better.  Fertility clinics and surrogacy agencies should be required to support parents in introducing age appropriate information about parentage at a very early age.  An undertaking to do so should be mandated by these agencies and psychological support should be offered.<\/p> <p>  Parents' reluctance to disclose to their children has been linked to a lack of education on why and how to do this and fears their children will be marginalised.  Changes in legislation can pave the way for inclusion of previously marginalised groups, as we have clearly seen in recent years with progressive legislation regarding gay marriages, divorce etc.  Legislation that includes new family formations protects the needs and rights of children and families.  Just because people become parents in non-conventional ways does not make them less capable parents.  Legislation needs to treat all of our children equally and to offer children born through surrogacy all the privileges offered to children born in more conventional ways.  Their choice to trace or not to trace their parentage will be an individual choice, but access to records about their births and-or parentage should be made accessible to them in early adulthood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe Nic Dhomhnaill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1428,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it on the matter of international surrogacy, including the right of children born through surrogacy to preserve their identities.  Our office submitted our full observations on Monday.  Therefore, I will only hit on a number of important points in this statement.<\/p> <p>  As committee members are aware, the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body that was established in 2004 under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  Under that Act, the OCO has two core statutory functions: to promote the rights and welfare of children up to 18 years of age; and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals that have, or may have, adversely affected a child.<\/p><p>Our office has previously expressed the view, and continues to hold the view, that provision should be made in law for the rights of all children in Ireland born through surrogacy.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 presents a significant opportunity to provide clarity for children who will be, and have been, born through domestic and international surrogacy.  However, as outlined in our office's observations, we are of the view that the Bill, as it stands, does not have sufficient regard to children&rsquo;s rights and that a number of issues need to be considered further to ensure the Bill will be child centred and rights based.<\/p><p> Ireland has an obligation under international law to respect, protect and fulfil the rights set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, for all children in Ireland born through domestic or international surrogacy.  In this regard, we are concerned about the absence of provision in the Bill for children born through international surrogacy and the Bill&rsquo;s silence as regards children already born through a domestic or international surrogacy arrangement.  The OCO acknowledges concerns that a double standard may arise if parental orders are granted in respect of a child born through commercial surrogacy abroad.  The objective of maintaining the integrity of a domestic prohibition of commercial surrogacy is understandable.  However, categorically excluding the possibility of recognising the relationship between a child born through international surrogacy and his or her intending parents will have immediate and grave consequences for the child and is contrary to the UNCRC and the European Convention on Human Rights.  We recommend, therefore, that the Bill include provision both for children born through international surrogacy arrangements and for retrospective assignment of parentage and parental responsibility in both domestic and international surrogacy arrangements.<\/p><p> Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that the best interests of the child be treated as a primary consideration in all decisions relating to a surrogacy arrangement that affects the child.  Although this principle is partially reflected in some of the Part 7 provisions of the Bill concerning surrogacy, we believe these provisions can be strengthened to align the Bill fully with the principle set out in the UNCRC and the standard set out in Article 42A of the Constitution.  Therefore, we recommend that the Bill explicitly provide that all decisions made in respect of a surrogacy arrangement that affect the child must have regard to the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.<\/p><p> We welcome the fact the Bill provides for the recording of information relating to the origins of children born through domestic surrogacy on a national surrogacy register and that it allows children aged 16 and 17 to apply to obtain such information.  However, we believe further attention needs to be given to the provisions relating to children&rsquo;s access to information, with a view to aligning the Bill fully with children&rsquo;s right to preserve their identity under Article 8 of the UNCRC and with an approach that respects the evolving capacities of children.  In this regard, we encourage consideration to be given to amending the Bill to provide that information on the origins of children born through international surrogacy and children already born through surrogacy must be recorded, and to provide that applications to obtain identifying and non-identifying information on origins may be made by a child or on behalf of a child by the child&rsquo;s parents or guardian, without limitations as to the child&rsquo;s age.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation.

Ms Nic Dhomhnaill referred to the longitudinal studies and stated that disclosure may not happen where there is a lack of education or understanding of why it should, or where there is a fear of othering the child, yet best-practice experience in psychology suggests and strongly supports the idea that full disclosure from the very beginning is the correct way forward for the child.  One of the difficulties in parents' discussions relates to what sort of language happens in this context and how to equip children with age-appropriate words in order that they will have an understanding of what is private information versus what can be publicly shared.  I would welcome Ms Nic Dhomhnaill&rsquo;s thoughts on that and on how we could best build in a mechanism that would ensure that parents would be equipped to have those discussions and on how they can be continuously supported.  Most important, how best can the child be continuously supported in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Ms Nic Dhomhnaill's area of expertise relates to cases where there is family breakdown and the effect of separation on children.  As the law stands, mothers of children born via surrogacy are in an especially vulnerable position in Ireland because they have no legal relationship with their child and, therefore, in a case of family relationship breakdown, there is often a weaponising of that child to the detriment of both the child and the mother with whom, as Ms Nic Dhomhnaill pointed out, the child might have had a very good relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#C00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1432,"content":"<p>On the telling of the child, in my clinical practice I approach that by telling him or her that he or she has been co-created, in order that the parents will be supported with their telling of the child.  My experience has been that the parents' level of comfort or discomfort with what is disclosed to the child steers what they are going to say.  The success of telling a child relates very much to whether the parents have mourned their journey through infertility and are then in a position to deal with the reality of what they need to say to the child.  I think we are all agreed the best practice is disclosure and the longitudinal studies point to that.<\/p> <p>  The disclosure needs to happen in a very age-appropriate way.  I heard a story of a little boy in a GP's waiting room recently saying aloud that he had three mothers.  It needs to be done in such a way that the child will know where it is appropriate or not appropriate to say it, without stigmatising the surrogacy in any way for the child.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that often is not considered relates to the fantasies children may have about a surrogate mother, and this is where education and some psychological support is of great benefit.  Much work that has been done shows that if a parent, or any idea of a parent, is absent, the fantasies of the child has of that absent other will, invariably, be extreme.  They can involve a fantasy of, say, a very benign figure who might come and rescue the child in adolescence when he or she gets into conflict with his or her parents, or they can be malevolent, whereby there can be a fear that the surrogate mother might eventually come and want to kidnap him or her.  They are the aspects psychologists can help with.  More psychological support needs to be provided to help people with that disclosure to uncover the fantasies a child might have.<\/p> <p>  Children can also sometimes have a fantasy that his or her mum and dad have gone to a lot of trouble to get the child.  That is important because if a child thinks that is the case, whether because they travelled to Ukraine or wherever, that can leak out in the child thinking he or she has to be good.  Many of the issues I have seen with children born through surrogacy arriving into the practice have related to how the information has been given to the child.<\/p><p>I agree with the Senator regarding weaponising.  The most tragic cases I have seen in family breakdown have been when assisted reproduction has been weaponised in the legal battle and custody.  I fully support the legislation to protect the rights of biological and non-biological mothers in surrogacy so that this cannot be weaponised when people separate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe Nic Dhomhnaill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1434,"content":"<p>In that regard, the reason for surrogacy, certainly for heterosexual couples, is generally because the woman cannot carry a child to full term.  In a second relationship, the father may go on to have other children.  In that regard, I have seen the role and access of the mother diminishing as siblings are born and that where there is a very strong bond and attachment between the mother and child, there is a loss the child experiences as the mother cannot go in and argue her access rights because she is afraid.  My view is that the Judiciary would be very sympathetic in such a situation, but who would want to be the mother to test that?

I would not move towards a belief that these children will need counselling.  What is really important, however, is how they are told.  The fertility clinics and surrogacy agencies may well have a role in that regard in, first, considering with people why they might tell or not tell and hearing their ambivalence about doing so.  Senator Seery Kearney spoke about weaponising in family breakdown.  The most heartbreaking situations I have seen in family breakdown are when the children are told at the point of the breakdown.

The idea here is that we need to start the conversation long before the child is born.  The intended and surrogate parents, as well as the clinics and any other parties that may be involved, need to discuss how this will work once the child is born.  The information needs to be clear.   There is a need to gather that information.  As we stated, we recommend that children get full access to information when they desire it.  As such, that information has to be gathered.  If one is gathering it, one needs to educate the people involved that the child be informed as soon as possible in the appropriate way, as Ms Nic Dhomhnaill stated.  That is the way forward.  It is about how one minimises any trauma that may come from the circumstances.  I refer to the idea that children always wonder who their parents are and what they thought about them.  Whatever the parental background is, children try to figure it out.  If one is honest and open with a child in an age-appropriate manner, things become much easier.  That has to happen with the professionals with whom the child deals.  For example, the GP, the gynaecologist and anyone who had interaction with the child in the first few years has to be honest and open about the background.  Those are the sorts of things that need to be considered.  That is a question of culture as well as public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1439,"content":"<p>It is, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#D00700","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1440,"content":"<p>We need to move in that direction but having these discussions here openly and clearly is a really good start.

There is no doubt these children are very wanted children.  We have seen that in recent weeks via testimony of parents who have come before the committee.  However, it is clear from the discussion this morning that there is a Pandora's box of psychological issues surrounding surrogacy.  My first question is for Ms Nic Dhomhnaill.  As a person who works in the area of child psychology, particularly in the context of families where the parents are undergoing a divorce, she has obviously seen cases where children feel some form of responsibility or guilt for the separation of their parents.  That can tie into feelings of abandonment that can be very damaging to a child's sense of self and strong core identity.  I ask her to comment on the possible psychological effects of a child finding out that he or she was conceived through surrogacy and then having to wait until attaining the age of 16 or 17 to request identifying information that he or she will possibly never receive.<\/p><p>My second question is for Dr. Muldoon.  I wish to put on record comments by the commissioner for children's rights in Ukraine, where commercial surrogacy is common and, indeed, a growing business.  The Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for Children's Rights, Mykola Kuleba, has stated that surrogacy in Ukraine is unregulated and violates children's rights.  According to him, surrogacy is the exploitation of women by private businesses in order to earn income and meet the needs of adults, but it violates children's rights.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am categorically against commercial surrogacy.  It is the objectification of the child and its positioning as a commodity. <\/blockquote> <p>What is the view of Dr. Muldoon on those comments?  How does he consider that surrogacy protects the best interests of the child, their right to identity and their access to origins?  It leaves these children in statelessness for years because adults have focused on their rights rather than those of the child.<\/p><p>Dr. Muldoon's role as Ombudsman for Children involves the investigation of complaints about services provided to children by public organisations.  On Tuesday, Deputy O'Gorman apologised on behalf of the Government to all of those who had been hurt by the legacy of illegal birth registrations in this country.  Is it possible that the complex nature of international surrogacy and particularly the manner in which the rights of the children, surrogates, donors and prospective legal parents can come into conflict may lead to a future apology to persons who are hurt by this system being necessary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#D01000","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1444,"content":"<p>This Bill is about the rights of children but we also need to be inclusive of the surrogate mothers.  My understanding and reading of the research is that the surrogate mothers do not have an intention to have and rear a child and that becoming a parent is about the intention to become a parent.  The surrogates are reporting non-attachment to the children in question.  I am in favour of legislation and of disclosure to children based on the view of Dr. Mali Mann, who has done a lot of research in the area, which I have mentioned.  That view is that the surrogate mother should not be promoted in the child's eyes to a status that is in any way on par with that of the social or functioning mother.  That is really important in the disclosure.  The surrogate mother should be disclosed as another person who assisted in the child's coming into the world while the absolute significance of the functioning parents is maintained.<\/p> <p>  On the age at which children should have access to their records, I am not sure.  I would need more time to think about it.  I would have thought 18 but I am hearing discussion of 16 or 17 this morning.  On the basis of my background in child psychology and adolescent psychology in particular, I would say that there is a peak of adolescence at which issues of identity reach a crisis point.  This is referred to as the individuation stage of adolescence.  All of the crises, including anorexia, bulimia and self-harm, are much more likely in what we call the middle phase of adolescence, the ages between 14 and 16.  It is really important to consider the developmental stages of adolescence and to look to the age at which someone can seek out their records as being one beyond that peak of adolescence.  I am not sure that the age of 16 is beyond that peak.  That is my concern.  It might be used as a weapon against the biological or functioning parent.  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon would like to address the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe Nic Dhomhnaill"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1445,"content":"<p>We have just under a minute but I am happy to give Dr. Muldoon an extra minute to answer Senator Keogan's questions because the time would be very tight.

People can have a certain view and be against something but it will happen regardless of whatever decisions are made by any person who is in government.  I would like to get Dr. Muldoon's views on that.  There are children who are in urgent situations because of their parents, whose family status may not currently be recognised, having very serious medical issues.  What would Dr. Muldoon recommend in that regard?  Is there a course of action that could be taken urgently in respect of those children?<\/p> <p>  I also have questions for Ms Nic Dhomhnaill with regard to child psychology in general.  There are all sorts of different types of families in the modern era.  I welcome that.  There are people who parent alone.  There are people who have one, two, three or four parents.  There is a whole range of situations.  It does not matter to me whether there is one person parenting alone or ten parents or whether those parents are male or female.  I would like to get Ms Nic Dhomhnaill's general view.  With regard to child psychology, there is a range of issues that all children face which may have no connection or link to surrogacy.  There could be what some would deem a traditional family, that is, a mother and a father, a female and a male, and 2.5 children, in which everything looks great from the outside but those children may, for whatever reason, be seeing child psychologists regularly.  I am not saying that as a criticism.  I am a big believer in counselling and I believe that play therapy should be available in all schools and that all children should have some type of play therapy because it is very good for them.  The point I am trying to get to is that it is really important that we do not in some way single out children born through surrogacy as having issues that other children do not have.  It is really important that message goes out loud and clear from the committee today.  I would like to get Ms Nic Dhomhnaill's views on that.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon could go first and address the question of regulation and those urgent cases in particular.

We need to prepare.  We have children who are currently in that limbo and whose parents do not have full legal rights in respect of consent and various other issues, whether in the area of education, medicine or other matters.  We need to prepare legislation for that as quickly as possible.  That is why the preparations being talked about relate to pre-surrogacy arrangements.  We should look at the process as starting as early as possible so that we know who is in charge and who will take what responsibilities and at what stage.  We should also allow for a post-birth scenario.  Should anybody change his or her mind, there must be some sort of a framework that allows for those disputes to be settled and for decisions to be made as quickly as possible, which is again for the benefit of the child.<\/p><p>The best interests of the child suggest that at no stage should he or she be left without somebody who has full parental rights who is willing to accept them.  That is crucial in order that those children can be looked after in the best way possible.  That is the legislation members, as legislators, need to bring forward so we can protect all those children.  Regardless of where they are born and what the background is, when they come back to Ireland they should have the right that they deserve, and that every other child has, because it has been set out in a regulation in an appropriate manner.  The best interests of the child are served that way.  Again, for children in their current circumstances, we need to know we will look at the retrospective scenario so the legal limbo is taken away and there is clarity regarding who has rights in that regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1452,"content":"<p>It is important to put on record the rates of psychological adjustment are actually better in families where there have been assisted methods of reproduction.

It is very interesting to hear that 90% of families were in contact with the surrogate mother after the first year and 60% of them were in contact a decade later.

There are a number of points and I will try to be as brief as I can.  An important point for us to raise on what is currently provided for in the Bill relating to the ages at which children may obtain identifying and non-identifying information, and the ages at which a parent or guardian will do so on their behalf, is the rationale for what is provided is not clear to us.  There are a couple of issues.  First, we are concerned about the fact that while a child is defined in the legislation, broadly, as a person under the age of 18, when it comes to the whole question of applying to access information, 16- and 17-year-olds are being defined as adults.  That is not appropriate from a child rights perspective because it removes the scope of any additional safeguards and supports a child might benefit from having the option of accessing by virtue of being under the age of 18.  The Bill should be consistent in respect of access to information about identity and should consistently apply the definition of a child as a person under the age of 18.<\/p> <p>  The second piece around the recommendation we made is about having regard to the international children's rights standards, where children's rights to information about their origins and preservation of their identity are held as children.  The international standards, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, etc., do not prescribe a minimum age at which children should be able to exercise that right.  Quite an agile approach is provided for, which is that the child is the rights holder and the person entitled to exercise his or her rights as a child.  The role and responsibility of parents is to support children in the exercise of their rights in accordance with children's evolving capacities.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate it is challenging but we suggest the committee might like to think about providing for a more agile approach rather than looking at the whole question of minimum ages because it is quite precarious.  If committee members feel the need to look at prescribing a minimum age, whether it is what in the legislation right now or another age, we encourage them to think about the specific purpose of prescribing that minimum age.  What will it achieve for the child? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1458,"content":"<p>We cannot emphasise enough that children are independent rights holders all by themselves.

I read the ombudsman's more extensive submission, which relied heavily on the UN convention and the role of principles.  The witnesses were about to elaborate on the EU and I would like to afford them the opportunity to do that.  If we have a mechanism, and the committee has heard about the Canadian model in which prior to any commencement of a fertility journey there is an obligation for counselling and setting out agreements of contact expectations, everybody should go into it very clearly with their eyes wide open as to what expectations are made of them.  That moves through to the surrogate holding her own bodily integrity throughout, which everybody wants to ensure.  We have also heard from a UK lawyer who appeared before the committee, Ms Natalie Gamble, who talked about the safeguards that could be put in to ensure there is no exploitation of the surrogate and the key payment marker points to look for.  I see those matters reflected in the Verona principles mentioned in the ombudsman's submission.<\/p> <p>  I would like to afford the representatives the opportunity to reply to that, but before we do so I will state two things.  First, children in Ireland are left in a place of statelessness, not because parents are focusing on their own desires and putting themselves first, but because there are appalling delays in the courts system in Ireland.<\/p><p>As part of the process of getting an emergency travel document, any parent bringing a child home to Ireland has to give an undertaking to issue court proceedings immediately upon his or her return, and that is verifiable.  There are delays such that some children in this State will have already started school and still not have been through the courts for the parental recognition of the father, even though court proceedings will have issued.<\/p><p> Second, any apology that may be due in the future will be due to the children who are being let down and failed by the State in the here and now for the fact they have no right of legal relationship with their parents and with their mother in particular.

I want to reiterate that, in our observations, both the UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children and the Verona principles which the Senator referred to are clear that the state of the intending parents is responsible for ensuring statelessness does not occur and for providing the necessary assistance to ensure the child obtains the nationality of the intending parents promptly and after the child's birth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Groarke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>I would like to make a point about how concerns about the legal status and parentage distract the new parent.

The following might be an unfair question to put to Dr. Muldoon.  We have discussed regulation and that is best practice, which is what everyone wants to see and that regulation is starting from as early as possible.  There is a pre-birth parentage model and there is something similar in Professor Conor O'Mahony's report from 2020, which is invaluable and holds a lot of the key things we need to be doing.  Do the witnesses want to comment on that?  If they do not want to answer, that is fine.  The pre-birth parentage model is the way to go rather than post-parentage because it marks out that surrogacy is another way to parent and is very different from other forms of parentage like adoption.  Sometimes people compare or link surrogacy and adoption but they are two very different processes and we need to make that very clear.  We have time and I always ask a pre-birth versus post-birth question so why change the habit now a few weeks in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#G02300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1482,"content":"<p>I am happy to take that question.  When we were looking at what model we thought would be appropriate and in the best interests of the child, we considered the report of the special rapporteur on child protection and the children's rights standards that are set out in the Verona principles in particular and what they are seeking to guide states in doing in implementing those child rights principles.<\/p><p>In our observations, as the committee has seen, we have proposed, similar to the rapporteur's report, that a pre-birth model of transferring parentage be established in domestic legislation and that the 2022 Bill be amended to take this into account.  We were particularly guided by the Verona principles.  Adequate pre-surrogacy arrangements are provided for in the 2022 Bill.  Those arrangements include the consent of the surrogate mother and the parents of the donor, and that independent legal advice has been given etc.  If the surrogate mother is permitted to confirm her consent for a period of time after the birth, there is no impediment from a children's rights perspective to having a pre-birth transfer of parentage in place.  That is why we made that recommendation.  We also think, as the special rapporteur has outlined in his report, that this would involve an application for parentage to the courts, alongside pre-authorisation of the surrogacy on the basis of a set of pre-surrogacy arrangements.  That would allow for an assessment of the best interests of the child to be taken into account by a court before the surrogacy is proceeded with.  Doing that would allow for judicial oversight all the way through the process and not just after the birth.

Its lack really disadvantages children who have been born via surrogacy and have come into the country.  To quote D.W. Winnicott, there is no such thing as a baby; there is only a mother and baby.  A baby cannot survive.  During that early stage, when a child is four months old, six months old, or whatever, the primary caregiver plays a role in the stage of preoccupation.  During that stage, a mother is preoccupied with her baby.  These children are disadvantaged if the mothers cannot avail of maternity leave.<\/p> <p>  The Vice Chairman also asked about inheritance rights.  As children's knowledge evolves and they become aware, it has the potential to be divisive in families if other siblings have more entitlements.  That is a big issue.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I have been thinking about relates to grandparents.  It is a lineage of which the children are deprived.  The grandparents do not have any legal rights.  If children do not have some legislative connection to their mothers, what is the situation with regard to grandchildren?  What relationship do the child's children have with the biological mother or non-biological mother, in some surrogacy cases?  <\/p> <p>  There are considerable connotations with regard to child development.

She asked about retrospective arrangements and in responding, I would like to give a frame for the recommendations we have made.  We want to bring all those children, whether they were born prior to the commencement of the Bill or will be born in the future, to same level.  We must ensure those children are not experiencing differential treatment on the basis of when they were born and the framework in which they were born.  In providing for retrospective surrogacy, we noted that provision was made for the making of retrospective applications in the original drafts of the Children and Family Relationships Bill in 2014  It is not clear why those provisions were not carried through to the 2022 Bill.<\/p> <p>  We see precedent for providing for retrospective recognition of parentage in the Children and Family Relationships Act in terms of donor-assisted human reproduction.  The international standards recognise that parentage cannot be determined on the basis of the same standards that might apply in future, under the framework of the 2022 Bill, because those standards were not previously in place.  Adapted criteria are required to be placed there for those applications.<\/p> <p>  In terms of international surrogacy arrangements, we have recommended in our observations that a post-birth framework should be put in place.  As I mentioned previously, a framework must be put in place to recognise the relationship between a child and his or her parent arising from an international surrogacy.  That does not mean we should automatically recognise parentage.

I know what I mean when I use that term.  I know where I draw the line between commercial and compensated surrogacy.  Domestic surrogacy is a compensated surrogacy because there is provision for childcare and all the things that should be attendant to a surrogate mother on this journey.  However, there is no internationally accepted definition.<\/p><p>One of my concerns is that in the conversation relating to commercial surrogacy, where places such as the US and Canada are the only ones that same-sex couples, in the main, can go to, if we either fail to define it or define it incorrectly, we will have a difficulty.  If we rule out payment, say that there cannot be payment in any circumstances, ban it and introduce some sanction, the State will have difficulty finding a way to proceed.  In such circumstances, we will be discriminating against children - children will be born regardless - and we will also close down the possibility of parentage for a number of same-sex couples.  A question that arises in this regard relates to how we resolve the fact that there is not an internationally recognised definition.  When the term is used, there is at times a drawing towards the most exploitative end of things.  Nobody who is paying a fee in the context of surrogacy, which can be well over $100,000 in Canada, is contemplating exploitation.  In fact, Canada is where there is a very good model for ensuring that nobody is exploited.  I would welcome that perhaps we discuss for a little how we might overcome the concern I have outlined.

As the Senator said, there will be changes over the next ten years.  Different methods of surrogacy will affect things.  We have to future-proof it as well.

We appreciate these kind of concerns.  I am not sure if this is relevant to the Senator&rsquo;s question about double standards, but we support the prohibition on commercial surrogacy in a domestic context because we regard it as the strongest way to mitigate against the risk of the sale of children.  At the same time, we recognise that commercial surrogacy happens in other jurisdictions where we have no control.  The key thing, as Dr. Muldoon said, is we need to face that reality and not look away from it.  We need to legislate for that reality in a way that upholds the best interest of the child.  Not legislating will not serve anybody&rsquo;s interest, not least the child&rsquo;s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1496,"content":"<p>We come back to the fact that by focusing on the best interests of the child, we recognise that there are cases such as the one we heard about from Dr. Gamble, where even in altruistic situations - it is referenced in the submission - there can be coercion and exploitation, such as, for example, an obligation on a sibling to carry a child.

I apologise for being unable to attend in person on this occasion.  My submission will focus on the issues paper provided by the Departments of Health; Justice; and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to the committee in advance of its hearing on 7 April that raises a number of concerns regarding recommendations made in my report of December 2020 that examined children's rights and best interests in the context of donor-assisted human reproduction and surrogacy in Irish law.<\/p> <p>  It is somewhat regrettable that the three Departments never took the opportunity to contact me following the submission of my report to raise these concerns and to afford an opportunity for them to be discussed further.  It was also regrettable that I did not have sight of the issues paper prior to the hearing on 7 April because this made it very difficult for me to respond properly to these concerns during my own appearance at this hearing.  For this reason, I am grateful to the committee for providing me with the issues paper and giving me an opportunity to respond to it today.<\/p> <p>  In brief, the main points raised in the issues paper regarding the recommendations in my report were that they would leave Irish courts with no real choice as to whether to recognise international surrogacy arrangements, would leave foreign surrogate mothers with fewer protections than Irish surrogate mothers, would give rise to practical difficulties in arranging court hearings before children born abroad are brought to Ireland, would be inconsistent with existing legislation relating to citizenship and passports and would give rise to constitutional concerns with respect to the retrospective reassignment of parentage from birth parents to intending parents.<\/p> <p>  Having carefully considered the issues paper and done further analysis on it, it is my considered view that these concerns are based on an incomplete understanding of the recommendations and the associated legal landscape and are beset by logical inconsistencies.  On the first two points, the recommendations in my report provide an outline for a legislative framework for the recognition of international surrogacy arrangements where and only when they meet minimum standards, including in respect of the protection of the surrogate mother, and that an Irish court would have to assess whether or not those standards were met and would have a clear basis for refusing to recognise those arrangements if these standards are not met.  The Government&rsquo;s current proposal of leaving international surrogacy entirely unregulated by excluding it completely from the assisted human reproduction Bill does neither of these things.  It leaves foreign surrogate mothers with no protection whatsoever under Irish law and creates a situation where applications by intending parents for parentage and guardianship will invariably be approved with no opportunity to consider any of the legal or ethical issues arising in respect of the surrogacy arrangement.  As such, the Government&rsquo;s proposed approach ignores the very issues about which concerns are raised in the issues paper.  It allows for a situation whereby Irish couples can bring children here in circumstances where surrogate mothers were seriously exploited or did not properly consent and allows for the parents to be recognised eventually as parents or guardians without any scrutiny of the treatment of the surrogate mother.<\/p><p>For this reason, the only way to apply protection and safeguards in Ireland to the recognition of international surrogacy arrangements is through bespoke legislation, as recommended in my report.<br\/><br\/>The claims made in the issues paper regarding practical difficulties in hearing applications for recognition of international surrogacy before the child is brought to the jurisdiction are very much overstated.  Remote court hearings are already an integral feature of our courts system following the Covid pandemic.  Short notice is not a problem of any real significance.  It is possible in most cases to predict the date of birth of a baby pretty accurately to within a couple of weeks.  The hearings can be scheduled in advance.  In the event the baby is very premature, the baby will in that circumstance have to stay in hospital for some time anyway and will be unable to travel.  Therefore, any question of time pressure to allow the child to be brought to Ireland does not arise in that way.<br\/><br\/>The rationale in my report for recommending that the application is heard before the child arrives in the jurisdiction is that it is the most effective way of giving an Irish court a choice of refusing to recognise the international surrogacy arrangement, which is one of the concerns the issues paper expresses.  This may be because the surrogate mother has not genuinely consented, local laws have not been observed or the child's right to identity has not been protected.  It would leave these issues to be resolved in the country where they arose and avoid the cross-jurisdictional challenges that would arise after the child has been brought to Ireland.  These would make it more likely that an Irish court would gloss over problems with the surrogacy arrangement on the basis that the child is now living here and has established a family relationship with the intending parents.  Having said this, it is important to stress that if it is felt it is more practical to hear applications for recognition of international surrogacy arrangements after the child has been brought to Ireland there is no reason in principle this could not occur.  This is not a basis or adequate justification for leaving the recognition of international surrogacy arrangements entirely unregulated.  It would simply be a reason to hold the application and court hearing after the child arrives instead.<br\/><br\/>Questions of inconsistency with existing legislation governing citizenship and passports ignore the fact that the legislation is enacted by the Oireachtas and open to modification by it.  It is entirely within the gift of the Oireachtas to adapt citizenship legislation to the unique requirements of international surrogacy.  For reasons already alluded to in the earlier session, it is in the best interests of the children involved to do just this.<br\/><br\/>The issues paper makes a claim that constitutional issues would arise if legislation allowed for retrospective reassignment of parentage from birth parents to intending parents.  This relies very much on a Supreme Court decision from 2009 in McD <i>v.<\/i>L.  This position is a flawed interpretation of the constitutional case law.  It relies on a Supreme Court decision that was not concerned with the issue of surrogacy or the issue of retrospective assignment of parentage.  The decision did not establish constitutional rights of sperm donors.  In fact, it found they did not have constitutional rights.  Contrary to what the issues paper claims, it did not draw any distinction between known donors and unknown donors since it was only concerned with a known donor.  It simply did not consider the position of unknown donors.<br\/><br\/>For all these reasons, to claim that McD <i>v.<\/i>L establishes that it would be unconstitutional to retrospectively remove parentage from a known sperm donor, and that by the same token it would be unconstitutional to retrospectively remove parentage from a surrogate mother, is a distortion of the judgment.  In the absence of any legislation governing assisted human reproduction at the time of the judgment, the entitlement of the father to parentage flowed solely from his genetic relationship to the child and existing legislation governing declarations of parentage.  If an unknown donor were to have become aware of the identity of his child and then applied to a court for a declaration of parentage, the unknown donor would have been entitled to this declaration in exactly the same way as the known donor.  There is no distinction between the two.  Nonetheless, as we have heard in previous hearings, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 did legislate to allow for the retrospective removal of parentage from unknown sperm donors.  Therefore, it is quite clear that McD <i>v.<\/i>L does not establish any general principle to the effect that the Constitution is an impediment to legislating for retrospective removal of parentage.<br\/><br\/>The relevant section of the issues paper, having relied entirely on McD <i>v.<\/i>L, ignores the more recent and much more relevant decision of the Supreme Court in MR <i>v.<\/i>An t&Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir in 2014.  This is the only Supreme Court case we have that directly considers the question of surrogacy.  The court stressed that the regulation of surrogacy is quintessentially a matter for the Oireachtas and called on the Oireachtas to enact legislation in this area.  This clearly establishes that the Oireachtas has a very wide latitude in deciding on the appropriate approach in legislating for surrogacy and that the courts would be very unlikely to find any law enacted in this area is unconstitutional.  While surrogate mothers, unlike sperm donors, would have constitutional rights in respect of the child, those constitutional rights, like any constitutional right, would be open to legislative intervention and limitation aimed at securing the best interests of the child.  We already see examples of this in adoption law, for example section 31 of the Adoption Act 2010.<br\/><br\/>For all of these reasons it is my considered view that the issues paper fails to provide convincing reasons in support of rejecting the recommendations made in my 2020 report.  The points made in respect of international surrogacy and retrospective recognition of surrogacy arrangements are internally inconsistent and based on a flawed understanding of the constitutional case law.  Moreover, no rationale is provided for the rejection of other recommendations made in my report, including on the right to identity which was discussed in this morning's session.  It remains my firm view that the Government&rsquo;s proposals will result in legislation which is contrary to Ireland&rsquo;s commitments with respect to the child's right to family life, the right to identity, the best interests principle and the principle of non-discrimination.  I am very happy to discuss all of these points further with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1503,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Mahony for being with us today and for his comprehensive opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#L00200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1504,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Mahony.

He was commissioned to engage on the report.  I want to say this and park it.  It establishes more than adequately his objective bona fides on this.<\/p><p>In his more comprehensive submission document Dr. O'Mahony quotes Mr. Justice O'Donnell in the more recent case of MR <i>v.<\/i>An t-&Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir.  I emphasise that Mr. Justice O'Donnell is now the Chief Justice.  In his judgment he stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is surely most clearly and profoundly wrong from the point of children born through an unregulated process into a world where their status may be determined by happenstance, and where simple events such as registration for schools, attendance at a doctor, consent to medical treatment, acquisition of a passport and even joining sports teams may involve complications, embarrassment and the necessity for prior consultation with lawyers resulting in necessarily inconclusive advice....The need for legislation is even more urgent today. <\/blockquote> <p>We need legislation.  We need a framework that works and protects the rights and interests of everybody in this, particularly with regard to the child and child protection.  From what I can gather, and from what we can gather from what Dr. O'Mahony has said to us, is that we are looking at a framework that involves an initial threshold for parents that is assessed in Ireland when they are embarking on a surrogacy journey.  This needs to be mandated or overseen by an authority or judicially.  We need this threshold.  We also need an oversight mechanism to safeguard the surrogate mother and ensure her consent.  Ideally this would be done before a pregnancy begins.  There should be guidelines that are overseen or checked.  Into this would be added a body of knowledge from an authority with experience of the country and specific clinics within it.<\/p><p>Then we have a system of a baby born and judicial oversight of an application, perhaps for an interim parentage order until there is a full parentage hearing in the Irish courts when a baby comes home.  Within that we need a bespoke change to citizenship requirements so it is not just the father's DNA but perhaps the mother's.  That then opens up the possibility of same-sex female couples availing of surrogacy also.  Is that more or less what we are looking at, in practical terms?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#L00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1506,"content":"<p>In broad terms.  There are points of detail there that could vary as to the exact sequencing of those steps and the exact forms those steps could take.  To take the Senator's last point on the citizenship issue first, it is very important that is included.  Ideally, you do not want to have the situation of statelessness alluded to in this morning's session arising for any child.  The Verona Principles are very clear on that.  It is not in the best interests of children to be left stateless in circumstances where the law of the jurisdiction where they were born does not recognise them as a citizen of that country but equally they are not yet recognised as a citizen of Ireland.  We also know from existing experience there can be delays in reaching the point where citizenship is granted.  That is why my report recommended that in the best interests of the child you would deal with the citizenship question at the same time as you would deal with the parentage question, rather than having a separate process that might result in a hiatus during which the child is stateless.  The issues paper essentially dismissed that recommendation on the basis that would create difficulties with existing citizenship legislation.  To my view, that is not an adequate response to that.  If there are inconsistencies with existing citizenship legislation then you amend that legislation through miscellaneous provisions of this Bill.  That is what the Oireachtas is there to do and it can do that at any time.<\/p> <p>  Very briefly on the MR decision, it makes clear the courts see the existing gap and the lack of regulation as being problematic for children and as not being in the best interests of children.  The courts want the Oireachtas to legislate in this area.  They have stressed the decisions to be made as to the detail of that are ones for the Oireachtas and not for the courts.  That gives us a very clear signal the risk the issues paper alludes to of potential challenges resulting in laws being declared unconstitutional in the future is a very low risk because the courts have made it very clear the social policy nature of surrogacy is such that it is really for the Oireachtas to make those decisions and the courts are really very slow and reluctant to get involved in second-guessing those decisions.  As such, the Oireachtas has a very wide latitude to adopt something, whether it is exactly along the lines the Senator just outlined in her questions or some variation on that theme.  They key point I want to make there is that is all within the gift of the Oireachtas.  When saying we cannot do x, y and z because of a risk of unconstitutionality, you would need to establish very clear reasons for doing so and I do not believe that has happened to date, or is especially likely given the tone of the MR judgment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1507,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Mahony for coming before us again.

We know there are many different combinations and permutations as to which parties provide the necessary genetic material in a surrogacy arrangement.  Ultimately, from the point of view of the international children's rights standards that guided my work for my report and the work of the UN special rapporteur, they do not have all that much to say about the different versions of surrogacy and exactly who contributes what to the process.  What the standards say about their key guiding principles including best interests, non-discrimination, right to family life, right to identity and those principles, particularly the non-discrimination element, make it very clear the circumstances of the child's birth, including which parties contributed which genetic material, should not have any bearing on the level of legal protection for those various rights a child enjoys.<\/p> <p>  As to the issue of various emerging economies and different levels of regulation and so on, this is precisely why I am concerned with seeing regulation in Ireland of international surrogacy arrangements that would provide clear standards that must be met before Ireland recognises any international surrogacy arrangements, in order to avoid precisely the kind of concerns the Senator has alluded to arising.  The Government's proposed approach of leaving the issue entirely unregulated completely fails to address that because it creates a situation where the child is brought to Ireland, there is nothing in place the parents must prove or no standards they must meet.  They simply find themselves, two years after the child is born, with a guardianship application that has no consideration whatsoever of the nature of the surrogacy arrangement or the standards applicable in the country where it took place.

There are complications that arise from each of those various reports so the recommendation in my report was there needed to be a further and more detailed piece of work done about the implications for the system of registration of births in order to work out the most appropriate model.

The Government's proposal of leaving international surrogacy completely unregulated provides foreign surrogate mothers with no protection whatsoever.<\/p> <p>  As to how you could go about this, again, there is a range of ways to approach it.  You could mirror exactly the protections provided in the domestic framework proposed in the Bill in respect of the laws governing international surrogacy arrangements.  There is no reason in principle why you could not make them completely equivalent.  The risk associated with that approach is if it is too prescriptive it may have the result of excluding a significant number of international surrogacy arrangements from the scope of the legislation, which ends up creating a separate problem, namely, you then have couples going abroad, bringing children back to Ireland and then finding themselves in the same difficulty we currently see them in, which is like a limbo or twilight zone.  For that reason, looking at the issue from the perspective of the child and again the principle of non-discrimination whereby the child should not be discriminated against based on the circumstances of his or her birth, my view was given the international nature of it it would be preferable to set minimum standards that must be met in every case but then also allowing for a degree of flexibility to recognise different jurisdictions will do things slightly differently.<\/p><p>It is to try to avoid a situation where there are too many children born through international surrogacy finding themselves excluded from the legislation simply because it is too prescriptive.

As unknown donors can become known donors through DNA, it is important to sever those rights.  Where do we sever those rights?

I will say a little more about the Supreme Court decision in McD <i>v<\/i>. L.  That was a case in which a lesbian couple had a child using a sperm donor who was a friend of theirs.  When the case came to court, it concerned a dispute which had subsequently arisen.  The original agreement had been that the parties would have an arrangement whereby the sperm donor would be known as a favourite uncle but would not be the child's father.  It was a private arrangement they had come to, but there was no legal framework for it at the time.  A dispute subsequently arose.  The father applied for guardianship and access to the child and the case ultimately came to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court made a number of findings in the case, one of which was that it made it very clear that it reaffirmed the long-standing position that unmarried fathers in Irish law have no constitutional rights.  They have a number of statutory entitlements to make applications to the court to be declared a parent if there is DNA evidence, to be appointed a guardian and so forth, but the Constitution provides no rights to unmarried fathers at all.  That was one of the core findings of the case.  Second, notwithstanding that, the court said it is normally in the child's best interests to have the opportunity of knowing the parent and, therefore, the case was remitted back to the High Court, and ultimately a decision was made in which access was granted.<br\/><br\/>What we see from that case in the issues paper is that, following McD <i>v<\/i>. L, in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provision was made for retrospective allocation of parentage in cases of donor-assisted human reproduction where people had a child using a sperm donor or an egg donor before the 2015 Act came into effect.  That retrospective reassignment of parentage was allowed in cases where the donor was unknown to the parties, but was not allowed in cases where the donor was known.  Until I saw the issues paper, my understanding of the rationale for that was that it was based on a sense that where there are known donors there is more scope for disputes between the parties and that, rather than encouraging those disputes or allowing them to bubble up to the surface, it would be better to leave that outside of the framework of the parentage allocation, whereas if the donor was unknown, the scope for that dispute would not arise in the same way and, therefore, one could proceed and allocate parentage retrospectively.  The issues paper clarifies that this was not the rationale in the 2015 Act.  The rationale was instead an understanding that the known donor had a constitutional right which could not be abridged by the Bill whereas the unknown donor did not have a constitutional right.  I cannot quite understand how McD<i>v<\/i>. L was interpreted in that way seeing that the Supreme Court found that the sperm donor has no constitutional right at all, irrespective of whether he is known or unknown, so that distinction cannot be drawn from the judgment.  There was no consideration of unknown donors in the judgment.<br\/><br\/>Second, on the question of the entitlement to apply for parentage, it applies equally to known donors or unknown donors.  As the Senator said, if an unknown donor were to become known, the donor could make an application under the existing legislation in the Status of Children Act 1987 to get a declaration of parentage in exactly the same way as a known donor would, yet the 2015 Act legislated to allow for retrospective reassignment of parentage away from that father.  From that point of view, McD <i>v<\/i>. L simply does not say what the issues paper says it says in respect of the constitutional rights which are enjoyed in this context by sperm donors.<\/p><p>Regarding the surrogate mother, under existing law the surrogate mother would like any other mother be recognised as having constitutional rights in respect of a child born to her.  That arises largely because she is currently recognised as the child's mother.  Of course, as we saw in the MR <i>v<\/i>. An t-&Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir case, it is open to the Oireachtas to amend the law to remove that presumption that the surrogate mother would be recognised as the child's mother.  The Oireachtas is very clear in saying that the decision on how to handle that issue is a decision for the Oireachtas and not for the courts.  I reiterate the point I made earlier that we have other examples of law.  Section 31 of the Adoption Act 2010 allows for adoption orders to be processed without the consent of a birth mother if it is deemed to be in the best interests of the child to do so.  That would also have the effect of transferring parentage away from the birth mother and to the adoptive parents in that case.<br\/><br\/>To my mind, it is very clear that the Constitution imposes no obstacle to laws that would allow for retrospective reassignment of parentage in surrogacy cases.  From a children's rights perspective for all the reasons we have heard in all of the hearings to date, we know a cohort of children are living in this disadvantaged legal world who have already been born through surrogacy arrangements and who will be left behind if the Bill proceeds in its current state.  For all of those reasons I strongly recommend the legislation should include provision for retrospective allocation of parentage.  I reiterate my analysis that there is no constitutional impediment to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Mahony.

I went to another meeting and I am back again.  It has been meeting after meeting.  In his opening statement, Professor O'Mahony spoke about exploitation.  What form does that take?

I want to hear more about what exploitation might mean and how we should tackle that in our proposal.<\/p> <p>  At our last meeting I asked some of the families who had been through surrogacy if they believed that transferring parental rights to the intending parents should happen before the birth of the child or after.

The risk exists and is well recognised by international human rights bodies and in the literature.  There is a wide range of possibilities when it comes to surrogacy.  When we legislate to regulate the recognition of surrogacy arrangements, we need our regulations to be sufficiently robust that they can deal not just with the best-case scenario but also with the worst-case scenarios.  That means sometimes requiring people, who have the very best intentions and who would never do anything that would be exploitative, to jump through a couple of additional hoops just to ensure we have a framework that is also sufficiently robust to deal with people whose intentions are not so benign.  That is important to say.  The law must be able to cater for the worst case is as well as the best.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what form exploitation might take.  The key issue there is the whole question of the extent to which the surrogate is genuinely giving free and informed consent and is genuinely looked after in terms of the necessary provision of medical care, legal advice and so on.  The question of compensation is an entirely different debate which members are all very familiar with; I will not get bogged down in that.  That question of ensuring genuine free and informed consent is at the core of ensuring we do not have exploitation.  At the minimum from that perspective, international surrogacy arrangements in the Irish courts must have a framework for confirming whether the surrogate mother gave genuinely free and informed consent to the arrangement.<\/p> <p>  If we leave it unregulated, which is what the Bill currently proposes to do, in practice a couple would engage in international surrogacy and then bring the child back to Ireland.  Let us say it is the typical case where the father has provided the sperm donation and there was an egg donor.  In those circumstances the father would be able to go to court and apply for a declaration of parentage because of the genetic connection.  That would be granted simply on the basis of the genetic connection with no consideration of the nature of the surrogacy arrangement.  The mother, who does not have a genetic connection, would not be entitled to be recognised as a parent but would be entitled to apply for guardianship after two years, which would give the mother many of the important rights in respect of making decisions for and caring for the child.<\/p> <p>  At that point if the mother has been caring for the child for two years, that application is almost certain to be granted.  If we choose to do it that way, none of those processes allow for any consideration of whether the surrogate gave genuinely free and informed consent.  Nor do they allow for any consideration of whether the child's right to identity was protected, that there was a framework in place for ensuring the donor was known and that there is a register allowing for tracing and so on.  Leaving it unregulated ignores those risks and makes it certain that the applications will be granted.  The issues paper took issue with my report on the basis that my report did not provide sufficient protection for the foreign surrogate and that it made it highly likely or certain that the application would be granted.  Both of those problems loom larger in the proposed approach of leaving international surrogacy completely unregulated.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about transferring parental rights pre-birth or post birth.  My report recommended the pre-birth model which I believe is more in line with the relevant international children's rights standards.  I know that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children took the same view earlier this morning.  Having said that, post-birth is still better than a lack of any regulation, if that makes sense.<\/p> <p>  On birth certs and tracing, I reiterate what I said to Senator Keogan which is that my firm view is that there needs to be a mechanism for tracing identity, including the identity of the surrogate mother and any donors of sperm or eggs.  That could be in the form of a register.  What exactly goes on the birth cert is a tricky and complicated question.  The surrogate mother's name could appear on the birth cert with some sort of notation to that effect.  It would also be possible to leave the surrogate mother's name off the birth cert but simply have the relevant information in the register separately.<\/p> <p>  From an identity perspective, the Bill currently proposes that none of this information would be available until the child is 16.  If we think about what was said this morning about the importance and benefits of early disclosure all of which was discussed in my report as well, we are saying in law that even if the parents of the child wanted to share that information with the child earlier, the law prohibits them from accessing it.  To my mind that is completely contrary to children's rights.<\/p> <p>  The last point related to legislating for other countries.  I reiterate that we can only do what we can do.  That is why my view is that our law needs to stipulate a degree of flexibility that recognises the limits of what the Oireachtas can actually achieve.  We should set minimum standards that we can stand over and accept as a country, but also allow a degree of flexibility that recognises the simple fact that it is a very wide and diverse world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1529,"content":"<p>I am very pleased that Professor O'Mahony has had the opportunity to appear before the committee to provide his explanation of his report which is distinctly different from its interpretation in the issues paper provided to the committee.  I agree that non-regulation is not fair.  I agree with him on the need for bespoke legislation to deal with that.  I also agree with Mr. Justice O'Donnell who said we need that legislation now more than ever.  I do not come from a legal background which is why I value so much Professor O'Mahony's legal expertise and insight which he is providing today.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions arising from his contribution today.  The first relates to citizenship and the proposal around being provided for in advance of the child arriving here.<\/p><p>That would hugely reduce stress on families, and it would be a very progressive and positive move.  Hypothetically, is that soon enough if we are to make a determination on citizenship?  What happens if, for some reason, a determination fails?<\/p><p> With regard to the Verona principles, we do not want a child ending up stateless.  A child will obviously have assistance from the country in which he or she is born.  From an Irish perspective, what happens if the determination is no?  If so, is it too late?<\/p><p> In terms of the advice on the protection of an international surrogate mother, Professor O'Mahony said it may still leave some children in the situation in which they find themselves in today.  Is there a way of dealing with that?  There probably is not.  If we apply standards, unfortunately some cases may not meet them.  What happens in such a situation?  How do we factor that in retrospectively?  Is that possible?  Is it fair?  Is it legally possible to apply standards retrospectively?  If so, how will that affect children who have already been born through surrogacy?<\/p><p> In terms of an age limit of 16, earlier today the Ombudsman for Children said he feels the age of 16 is not legally practical and does not know where it came from.  The age of 18 is the age of adulthood and consent.  The ombudsman feels that if we put in the age of 16, we could perhaps have a negative impact on other children's rights at the ages of 16 and 17.  Professor O'Mahony has proposed we do not have a limitation.  Does that same concern arise?  Does he feel that by removing the age limitation, we will remove that whole question for other rights as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#O00500","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1531,"content":"<p>On whether citizenship is soon enough, in practical terms one cannot grant citizenship to somebody who has not been born so in reality citizenship would have to be determined after the child has been born.  As the Vice Chairman alluded to, there is a big advantage to making the decision before the child is brought into the jurisdiction because, if it is not made, we run into the practical difficulty we currently have as to the child's actual entitlement to enter the jurisdiction and must come up with an <i>ad hoc<\/i>solution that allows the child to be brought into the country.  Again, that is all part of the rationale for why I felt it was better to have a single court procedure that would take place between the birth of the child but before the child was brought into the jurisdiction which would determine parentage and citizenship, so that by the time the parents sought to bring the child into the jurisdiction, everything would have been squared away.<br\/><br\/>What if that were to fail?  That is tricky because we must strike a balance if we recognise there are significant potential concerns about surrogacy arrangements, such as the position of a surrogate mother, but also in respect of the child.  We know there are risks around the law and the sale of children and there are risks around issues that relate to the protection of the right to identity.  There is also the question of what if there is an arrangement that did not comply with the local framework.  In that case there could be a clash between the laws of two different jurisdictions which could end up quite complex.  For that reason it is fair to say there needs to be a basis on which we will say there will be certain arrangements we will not recognise.<br\/><br\/>The question then becomes when that should happen and, in my view, that should happen as early as possible.  If we are not going to grant recognition because, for example, the surrogate mother did not adequately dissent or because local laws were not observed, we need to find that out very early on and that then becomes a dispute between the surrogate mother and the intending parents in the jurisdiction where the arrangement took place, which must be resolved under the laws of that jurisdiction and in its courts.  It is kept in one jurisdiction and it avoids it becoming a cross-jurisdictional issue where the child is now in Ireland and we get into all sorts of very significant complications around enforcement, recognition of judgments, conflicts of law and so on.  If we all agree there are certain red lines we would wish to draw to say these are the types of surrogacy arrangements we would not be happy to stand over, then there needs to be a possibility of our courts saying they are not going to recognise particular ones.<br\/><br\/>Where would that lead to?  That leads to a slightly separate point, which is a point I made earlier about the protections we would provide in our domestic law for the foreign surrogate mother.  If we make those completely equivalent to the protections we would provide in domestic law, they will end up being quite detailed and prescriptive.  As the detailed and prescriptive regime we might have domestically might differ from the regimes in other jurisdictions, they might not always align and that would increase the number of cases in which our courts would look at an international surrogacy arrangement and say it has not met the requirements for recognition in this country and therefore they are not going to grant recognition.  What does that mean in practice?  It means children are back to the same situation I have already outlined, which is that the father with the genetic connection could receive a declaration of parentage, he would have to go to court to get that and that may take a certain amount of time.  The mother could only ever become a guardian, could never be recognised as a parent and would have to wait up to two years to make that application.<br\/><br\/>In my report, to smooth over that particular issue with the mother and the two-year wait for guardianship, I proposed a halfway solution to steer people towards the best practices that would meet the standards we would like to see met, which would be to say, if a person meets those standards, he or she will be eligible for full parentage.  We have heard from the families repeatedly that parentage is what they want so that is an incentive for them to adhere to the highest standards.  On the other hand, if there are cases that fall short of that in certain circumstances, for example, if people use an unknown donor and, therefore, the right to identity could not be traced, they would not be entitled to parentage but could still apply to the court for guardianship.  That would mean the application would have to be heard by the court and decided in terms of the best interests of the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1532,"content":"<p>I apologise to Professor O'Mahony but I must stop him in full flow.

My fear from his response to the issues paper and from his opening statement is that by having the application via a virtual hearing, which is acceptable to me, and where it emerges there are problems with consent or something along those lines, parents find themselves in a situation where the child is refused entry to Ireland.  What does that mean?  Do the parents need to establish a home in the country in which the baby was born?<\/p> <p>  I believe it would be much better to have a regime in place that dealt with consent and issues and had some foresight before a pregnancy begins.  That would be the preferable safeguard for everybody, including the child who may by citizenship and a genetic link to his or her father have a right to be an Irish citizen but not a right to come to Ireland because of a consent issue.  A safer sequence of events would be to have a vetting of the factors that go into a surrogacy agreement within Ireland.  I understand we are dealing with a different jurisdiction etc., so there is complexity, but I believe that it would be better to have a checklist.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, while Alan Shatter was the Minister for Justice, a document was issued that was necessary for the issuing of an emergency travel certificate, and that is what is used.  That involves a member of the embassy overseeing the DNA testing in the presence of the surrogate mother and her presence is about assessing whether consent is given and whether there is an understanding.  The document is to give an assessment in that meeting.  It is a case of us doing it by using the body of knowledge that would arise around that country and perhaps the clinic within that country, because that can vary.

The complexity arises when the surrogate raises an objection.  I may have misinterpreted the Senator but it sounded a little like she was mentioning that the surrogate would raise that objection in the hearing before the Irish courts.  No matter the legal framework, we would not want to recognise surrogacy arrangements from a jurisdiction that did not ensure the surrogate had consented freely.  If the surrogate was raising an objection about an absence of free and informed consent, that objection would be more appropriate for raising in the courts of the jurisdiction where the arrangement took place.  They would the one who would ultimately determine authoritatively whether the surrogacy arrangement met the requirements of local laws.  That is the same way it would happen for our domestic framework that we are looking to enact; if the surrogate raised an objection, the Irish courts would determine that.<\/p> <p>  This raises the tricky question that if a surrogate in another jurisdiction raises a claim in that jurisdiction's courts stating that she did not fully consent, how would the Irish system respond?

That raises the question again of where is the child and whether he or she is here or there.  If a child has already been brought here but the courts of the other jurisdiction were to decide that it was not a valid surrogacy arrangement in that jurisdiction due to a problem with consent, it gets into some difficulties around conflict of laws and enforcement issues for that judgment.

Much of that is aimed at encouraging the best practice in the first place.  In the event that people are very careful and selective about which countries they go to and the arrangements in which they engage, making sure everything is completely on the level from day one, the prospect of things going wrong in that way and difficulties arising at a later point would be greatly reduced to begin with.  That is not to say it would never arise and, of course, things can happen and mistakes can be made.

I have put these questions to different witnesses and a concern I have is that this committee is to last for three months.  Today we have had the ombudsman before us and we have had great witnesses before, particularly families involved with surrogacy.  What is Professor O'Mahony's opinion on that, particularly as the legislation is so important?<\/p> <p>  I am asking about the timescale first because while this is not criticism of any Department, this matter will fall under three or four different Departments.  I said the last day that I wonder whether there should be one Department leading this and working with the other Departments.  When dealing with matters and going from one Department to another, they all do their best, as the witness knows, but sometimes it just does not work.  What is Professor O'Mahony's view on the time allowed to our committee?  Is the work doable or do we need to look at a longer timescale, practically speaking?  There is also the issue of this falling under so many different Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#Q00800","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1543,"content":"<p>On the timeframe question, there is no doubt the committee has been given a bit of steep hill to climb to do all this in three months.  I commend all the committee members on their hard work and it is very clear people are putting in an enormous amount of time and effort and are taking the matters incredibly seriously.  I know many members are prefacing questions by saying how complicated the issue is and they are still learning but it is clear that all the members are very much getting their head around the topic despite the complexity.  It is a result of the hard work everyone has put in, which is fantastic to see.  There is much to do and three months is a very short amount of time in which to do it.  The report must also be produced.  I know well in my job, where I write many reports, that much time and effort goes into writing the report after putting in the time to gather information in the first place.  It is a very short timeframe.<\/p> <p>  Aside from the work of the committee, the target of getting the Bill done before the summer recess is very tight.  It is in some senses an arbitrary target.  I know people in the Civil Service and legislative system more generally might say it is a slightly na&iuml;ve comment because things can change from year to year, including the order of business.  It has taken us years to reach this point and of course we would like to see this done quickly.  We would all like to see that there would be no further delay but whatever we enact will regulate surrogacy in Ireland for a generation.  Realistically speaking, there is not going to be an appetite to come back and tweak this in a big way any time soon.  I am certainly of the view that it would be much better for this to take another six or 12 months, if necessary, to get it right rather than putting through something now that is incomplete or where there may be difficulties and it remains how we do things for 20 years or more.<\/p> <p>  Ideally, I would rather see the committee given a little more time and space to really do its work to the best possible standard.

There is a misunderstanding in some of the questioning that has been going on that we need to talk about in regard to the birth certificate.  Where a child is born in a country, their birth is registered in that country and they receive a birth certificate which is a legal document.  When the person applies for a passport, and when all of the legal issues in Ireland have eventually been dealt with, the passport forever and a day shows that the person's citizenship is of Ireland but the place of birth on the passport states the city and the country where the person was born.  We have had discussion as to whether the surrogate mother should be on the birth certificate or not and how that should be.  That is not in the gift of the Irish Government to legislate for.  We are talking about a measure by which we can ensure the identity and gestational information of the surrogate mother, and the donor if there is a donor involved, are registered and that there is a requirement to register it.<\/p> <p>  There has been a misunderstanding in the committee, and the professor&rsquo;s discussion this morning highlighted it to me to be fair, which is that it is not in our gift to legislate for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#R00600","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1552,"content":"<p>In the international context, the Senator is correct.  The other issue which further confuses this is that this Bill is also dealing with domestic surrogacy.  The situation, of course, would be slightly different with respect to domestic surrogacy and a decision would need to be made on the domestic surrogacy framework about how the birth certificate addresses that question.  In respect of international surrogacy, what the Senator said is exactly right.  That creates a further decision to be made on whatever provision is made around how the birth certificate would be handled by the domestic frameworks.  Would it be aligned with the position of international surrogacy arrangements or would there be some differential position between the two?<\/p> <p>  I go back to the key point for me - I do not have a strong view on what exactly the birth certificate says one way or another - that there must be a mechanism for the child to trace his or her identity.  There must be some form of register that includes details about the surrogate mother and about any donors that is accessible, as I have already recommended, from birth through the parents initially and then through the child as the child matures.  The Senator is correct in saying that arrangements for the registration of births in the other jurisdiction is a matter for that jurisdiction and not a matter for the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1553,"content":"<p>As a follow on to that and in the domestic context, we need to be assured or to give consideration to the fact that that Irish-born child by surrogacy will use that document for an application to school as birth certificates are produced for many things.  While these children have a right, absolutely, to their identity and to their gestational origins, and nobody is disputing that we need a mechanism that preserves that, they also have a right when presenting themselves to keep that information private.  A birth certificate that mandates or obliges a surrogate mother, and a donor perhaps, to be named on the certificates, as has been suggested on this committee by one of our members, undermines that right to privacy for that individual.  When the person goes to get married he or she will have to produce a birth certificate at that stage as an adult and at that point he or she may not wish to go into that detail with the registrar, or whatever, but that does not mean that the person is not fully cognisant of all of the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#R00800","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1554,"content":"<p>Yes, that is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#R00900","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652310000,"counter":1555,"content":"<p>That is true and is one implication of that approach.  The other implication is on the position of the family.  On the one hand we discussed this morning that there are many good reasons for early disclosure and the evidence points to that being the best approach.  At the same time, there is also the reality that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it clear that it is for parents to guide their children in the exercise of their rights.  The Irish Constitution provides strong protection for the autonomy of the family to make certain decisions for itself.  From that point of view, if parents have good reasons for perhaps wanting to delay the point at which they would let the child know, then the birth certificate may also cut across that if it includes all of that information in the way that the Senator has outlined.<\/p> <p>  The converse of that on the other hand, in talking about the family having the right to make this decision, is that the current proposals are that none of this information will be accessible to the child or to the parents until the age of 16.  These proposals take that decision away from the family and it is the State saying to families that it thinks it is not in the best interests of children to find out their full identity until the age of 16, which is a very difficult decision to stand over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#R01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1556,"content":"<p>Yes, I agree completely with Professor O&rsquo;Mahony on that point and I thank him for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022051200002#R01100","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1652310000,"counter":1557,"content":"<p>I thank all our members for attending today and for engaging on what is an exceptionally important topic.
