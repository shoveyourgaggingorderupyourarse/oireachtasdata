IDA Ireland won 249 investments, increasing Ireland&rsquo;s market share of investment into Europe in the face of global declines in FDI. The number of people directly employed in multinational companies in Ireland grew to over 275,000.

These results demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s continued attractiveness as an FDI destination.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s signing of the OECD International Tax agreement in July 2021 provided stability to prospective and current multinational companies investing in Ireland.

IDA and its client companies are monitoring these international developments closely, and recent FDI investments would indicate that Ireland is still attractive to FDI investors. The corporation tax rate is only one aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition to MNCs. Companies investing in Ireland also reap the benefits of a young and highly educated workforce, a business-friendly environment, a stable economic and political environment, Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to European Union membership and access to the single market. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland report that globally, efforts to secure FDI are currently affected by issues such as disrupted global supply chains, increased energy costs and potential supply issues, increased construction and infrastructure costs \u00a0- all issues which have been impacted by the pandemic and geopolitical events. <\/p>  <p>  In order to provide an appropriate response to current economic and geopolitical challenges, in March Government agreed to the development of a White Paper on Enterprise Policy by the end of the year, led by my Department.\u00a0The White Paper will set out an ambitious medium-to long-term direction for enterprise policy.

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. For this reason, HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to support the construction of an additional supply of such properties. For a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a dwelling, having not been previously been used as a dwelling.<\/p>  <p>  A move to include other properties previously used as a residential home\/second-hand properties\u00a0within the scope of the scheme itself\u00a0would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply. Extending the HTB scheme in this way would provide no incentive effect\u00a0to encourage the building of new homes and would be likely to have a significant deadweight element and a high Exchequer cost. For these reasons, I currently have no plans to extend the HTB scheme to include such properties.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the maximum purchase value for a qualifying property to be eligible for HTB, the most recently available data from the Central Statistics Office,\u00a0relating to April 2022, indicate that the average sale price in the case of\u00a0first time buyer owner occupiers nationally is &euro;372,900 and for Dublin the equivalent figure is &euro;472,100.\u00a0 Also, when we look at the breakdown of HTB claims by house price set out in Revenue's annual statistical report on the scheme\u00a0for 2021, it sets out that some 76% of successful HTB claims in 2021 were for properties below &euro;375,000 in value.\u00a0\u00a0While not necessarily conclusive in terms of providing a guide as to the maximum purchase price that should apply under the scheme, these figures offer a perspective on the current maximum of &euro;500,000. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies\u00a0may be aware, work by\u00a0external consultants\u00a0on the review of HTB is currently underway and, in fact, is nearing completion.

These include the fact that\u00a0demand for oil and other energy products such as natural gas has increased sharply following the re-opening of many economies in the second half of last year, as well as the impact of the war in Ukraine which continues to negatively affect international energy prices. <\/p><p>It is important to note at the outset that there are constraints on what the Government can do on both excise and VAT rates applying to fuel products such as diesel as a result of EU Directives. <\/p><p>On the excise front, Ireland&rsquo;s taxation of fuel is based on European Union law as set out in the Energy Tax Directive (ETD). The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. \u00a0In the case of diesel, which is used as a propellant, the minimum rate is &euro;330.00 per 1000 Litres exclusive of VAT.\u00a0 This equates to 33 cents per litre.\u00a0 The March 9th (pre reduction) rate of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) on diesel was 53.55 cent per litre exclusive of VAT.\u00a0\u00a0This point therefore represented the starting point for Government action in relation to excise reductions on diesel.<\/p><p>As you are aware, the Government excise reductions for diesel implemented in March and April 2022 have brought the overall MOT rate to 40.54 cents per litre (VAT exclusive). This represents just over 7.5 cent per litre over the EU minimum rate of 33 cents per litre. However, any scope for further reduction is removed by the fact that the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS), which has been in operation since 2013 and is currently at its maximum payment level of 7.5 cent per litre, brings the effective rate of excise paid to 33.04 cents (VAT exclusive) for those availing of the relief.\u00a0 It is not possible to increase the DRS repayment amount by any further material amount as it\u00a0would bring the effective rate below the ETD.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The table below provides a comparison of \u00a0MOT Rates, Effective Rates and ETD Minimum from \u00a0October 21 to April 22. <table>    <tr>       <th>Auto-diesel rates\/1,000L from <\/th>       <th>MOT non-carbon<\/th>       <th>MOT carbon<\/th>       <th>Total MOT<\/th>       <th>Effective MOT incl.

In addition, a Member State can have two reduced rates. Ireland&rsquo;s standard rate is 23%, and its two reduced rates are 13.5% and 9% respectively.<\/p><p>Annex III of the VAT Directive determines what products and services can fall into the reduced rate categories. In this regard, it should be noted that petrol and diesel are standard rated products. Therefore, the rate of VAT is 23%. There is no potential for them being classified as reduced rates.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As there can only be one standard rate of VAT, any reduction in this rate must be applied to all other products and services that fall into this standard rate category. What this means therefore is that there is a very significant exchequer cost for any reduction in the standard rate.\u00a0 For instance reducing it by 1% would cost approximately &euro;542m per annum. A reduction in VAT on diesel to 15% the minimum rate at which the standard rate can be set would cost the Exchequer &euro;4.34 billion in revenue.<\/p><p>In relation to the issue of VAT being charged on other taxes, the Deputy should note that Revenue advise that this is standard practice.

The incapacitated individual can be the claimant themselves, or the claimant&rsquo;s spouse or relative. The tax relief is given by way of a deduction and is equal to the lower of the cost incurred and &euro;75,000. <\/p>  <p>  The incapacitated child tax credit of &euro;3,300, as provided for in section 465 TCA 1997, is available to an individual who proves that he or she has living, at any time during the year of assessment, a child who:<\/p>  <p>  1. if under the age of 18, is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity to such an extent that there is a reasonable expectation that the child would be incapacitated from maintaining him or herself if they were over the age of 18; or<\/p>  <p>  2. if over the age of 18, is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining him or herself and had become so incapacitated either before attaining the age of 21 or whilst in full-time instruction at any university, college school or other educational establishment. <\/p>  <p>  The dependent relative tax credit of &euro;245, as provided for in section 466 TCA 1997, is available to an individual who maintains, at his or her own expense, a relative who is unable to maintain him or herself or a widowed parent. The credit is also available where an individual depends on his or her own child, due to infirmity, and resides with and maintains the child at his or her own expense. Eligibility for the dependent relative credit is subject to the requirement that the relative, child or widowed parent&rsquo;s income for the year does not exceed a specified amount provided for in the legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Where the individual employs a carer to look after an incapacitated person and also qualifies for either the incapacitated child tax credit or the dependent relative credit in respect of that same incapacitated person, he or she may claim relief under both section 467 and section 465 and\/or 466 TCA 1997 as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that tax relief under section 467 TCA 1997 cannot be claimed where the individual employed to take care of an incapacitated person is the same individual in respect of whom the claimant receives either the incapacitated child or dependent relative tax credits. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also refers to the home carer tax credit in his Question.\u00a0 The home carer tax credit of &euro;1,600, as provided for in section 466A TCA 1997, is available to jointly assessed married couples or civil partners where one spouse or civil partner stays at home to take care of a dependent person. The carer may earn up to &euro;7,200 per year without affecting the value of the credit awarded, however once the carer&rsquo;s income exceeds this amount the value of the credit will be impacted. <\/p>  <p>  Where an individual employs a carer to take care of an incapacitated individual it is unlikely that he or she will also be eligible to claim the home carer tax credit as it is a requirement, under section 466A TCA 1997, for the individual to care for the dependent person himself or herself in order to qualify for the home carer credit. The facts and circumstances of each individual case determine the entitlement to tax relief however, additional tax relief will generally not be due in such a scenario.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0relation to the issue of\u00a0making taxpayers aware of their tax credit entitlements, I am advised that Revenue pro-actively corresponds with different cohorts of taxpayers to publicise the range of credits which they may be entitled to claim.\u00a0 For example, Revenue is currently in the process of writing to all PAYE taxpayers whose final tax position for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 is not yet balanced.\u00a0 This communications process may also prompt individual taxpayers to claim as yet unclaimed tax credits.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Detailed guidance material on each of these credits and reliefs is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website and can be found at the following links:<\/p>  <p>  - www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-20.pdf  <\/p>  <p>  - www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-05.pdf  <\/p>  <p>  - www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-27.pdf  <\/p>  <p>  - www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-29.pdf<\/p>  <p>  Any individual who requires assistance in determining the full range of tax credits and reliefs which he or she may be entitled to claim, should contact Revenue through MyAccount - <\/p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie\/en\/online-services\/support\/data-and-security\/security\/revenue.ie-and-myaccount.aspx<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900075#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[34732\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900075#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of instances since 2017 in which a gift clawback has arisen as a result of farmer who has inherited or been gifted land and has placed such land jointly in the name of their spouse; the average tax intake as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>Assuming this relates to a clawback of agricultural relief claimed under Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003, on an inheritance or gift of land, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to furnish precise figures of the number of instances in which a gift clawback has arisen in these particular circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Section 89 provides for agricultural relief to be applied on the receipt of a gift or inheritance comprising agricultural property.\u00a0 The relief operates by charging Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) on a reduced market value of the particular agricultural property, which takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable value of gifted or inherited agricultural property.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However the Relief can be withdrawn or clawed back if any part of the property (other than crops, trees and underwood) is disposed of or compulsorily acquired within six years of receiving a gift or inheritance, and it is not replaced with other agricultural property.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, where the date of the gift or inheritance and the valuation date are on or after 1 January 2015, relief may be withdrawn if the claimant no longer farms the property for at least 50% of their working hours, or does not farm the property on a commercial basis for at least six years from that date. <\/p>  <p>  As agricultural relief may be clawed back where there is a disposal of any part of the agricultural property, relief could be clawed back where the claimant disposes of any part of his or her beneficial interest in the land to his or her spouse.\u00a0 However, it would not be clawed back where the land is simply placed jointly in the name of a spouse. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has published extensive guidance on the operation of Agricultural relief in respect of CAT on the Revenue website at\u00a0 www.revenue.ie\/en\/gains-gifts-and-inheritance\/cat-reliefs\/agricultural-relief\/index.aspx, and also operates a CAT Helpline for anyone seeking further clarification\/guidance.

I believe that this agreement represents a fair compromise reflecting the competing interests of the many countries involved in the negotiations, large and small, developed and developing. <\/p>  <p>  The decision to join the global agreement was not taken lightly but I firmly believe this agreement brings a unique opportunity to reframe the international taxation architecture which has largely remained in place for almost a century.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that the international tax system needs to adapt to keep pace with changes in how business is conducted in an increasingly globalised and digitalised world. The last decade has been one of unprecedented change for multinational companies, with many anti-BEPS measures being introduced to tackle perceived tax avoidance. While these measures have been necessary, they have undeniably increased complexity for businesses.<\/p>  <p>  This is a global issue, which requires global action to solve in a coordinated way, in order to avoid the proliferation of unilateral tax measures and trade tensions. The OECD agreement will ultimately bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework, based on a shared understanding of where value is created in digital business models. This stability is of critical importance for business investment. This agreement will come at a cost, a substantial cost even, to Ireland in terms of reduced tax receipts, but I believe that this is a price worth paying to bring certainty and stability to the global trading environment and move away from the risk of trade wars, the impact of which would be amplified at a time of economic challenge.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in recent years in implementing international tax reforms, and stakeholder engagement has been an essential element of this process. I published Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap in 2018 to provide a clear line of sight for businesses on future planned reforms and updated it in 2021 to mark the concrete actions we have taken to adapt to agreed new international standards. My Department facilitates extensive engagement with stakeholders in advance of most new legislative measures being introduced, and this collaborative, transparent process provides certainty both to businesses already established here and those considering investing.<\/p>  <p>  It is therefore my view that a considered, collaborative implementation of the Pillar Two minimum tax agreement, in conjunction with our EU and OECD partners, continues to be in the best interests both of Ireland and of globalised businesses investing here.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900075#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regulatory Bodies","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900075#WRB05200"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[34830\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900075#WRB05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons assigned to the regulatory section within the Central Bank who are dedicated to the building society market;  if he will provide details of same in respect of credit unions.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>Credit unions in Ireland are regulated and supervised under the Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and regulations issued by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank), which set out the framework for the registration, regulation and operation of credit unions including detailed governance requirements and prudential requirements on items such as reserves, liquidity, investments, member savings and lending. <\/p><p>Under the 1997 Act, the Central Bank is responsible for administering the system of regulation and supervision of credit unions with a view to: <\/p><p>(a) The protection by each credit union of the funds of its members; and<\/p><p>(b) The maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.<\/p><p>The Registrar of Credit Unions, as the head of the Registry of Credit Unions regulatory division within the Central Bank, is responsible, as the delegate of the Central Bank, for managing the performance and exercise of the functions and powers of the Central Bank under the 1997 Act and has the power to do whatever is necessary for or in connection with, or reasonably incidental to, carrying out his or her responsibilities.<\/p><p>There are 42 persons (41 Full-Time Equivalent) assigned to the Registry of Credit Unions within the Central Bank. <\/p><p>There are no building societies in Ireland and as such no Central Bank staff assigned to regulate them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900075#WRB05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900075#WRB05500"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[34831\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900075#WRB05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he and or his officials have developed any plans to launch a State-owned building society.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>Neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor my Department have any plans for a State-owned building society.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is relatively concentrated by international standards and the recent decisions by some banks to leave the Irish market will further impact on this.

While the CPR came into force and has direct legal application across the entire European Union, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of\u00a0Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004\/42\/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765\/2008 and (EU) No 305\/2011. <\/p>  <p>  Under the\u00a0European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. In addition, the\u00a0Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020)\u00a0appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the \u00a0European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. Building control authorities liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s\u00a0National market surveillance programme 2021\u00a0is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR. The 2022 programme is currently being finalised and is expected to continue to focus on the extractive industries sector and expand upon the programme commenced in 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, in October of last year I requested a Market Surveillance Audit of all quarries in Donegal which was carried out by the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office in partnership with Donegal County Council and Geological Survey Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the initiatives above, Market Surveillance Authorities respond to complaints raised, therefore any information on suspected non-compliance should be submitted in writing (detailing as much information as possible) to either the appropriate local Market Surveillance Authority and\/or the National Building Control Office and Market Surveillance Office (NBCO&amp;MSO). The Local Market Surveillance Authority may be contacted through the City or County Council. NBC&amp;MSO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie<\/p>  <p>  Whilst the CPR focuses on the conditions which apply when placing a product on the market, clients, specifiers, designers and builders etc., should:<\/p>  <p>  - when\u00a0drawing up specifications, refer to the harmonised technical specifications and specifically to the requirements of individual characteristics when necessary,<\/p>  <p>  - when\u00a0choosing the products most suitable for their intended use in construction\u00a0works, review the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance,<\/p>  <p>  - check the Standard Recommendations published by NSAI, which give\u00a0guidance on appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended\u00a0uses of the product in Ireland, and<\/p>  <p>  - ensure\u00a0compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021, in this regard all\u00a0works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner, using proper materials which are fit for the\u00a0use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are\u00a0to be used.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recently published &lsquo;A Guide to the Marketing and Use of Aggregate Concrete Blocks to EN 771-3 in Ireland&rsquo; which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.\u00a0\u00a0This guide aims to facilitate clearer communication within the supply chain regarding the declared performance of essential characteristics of concrete blocks having regard to national provisions in Ireland. Guidance is also provided for specifiers, designers, builders, certifiers and end users who when specifying and choosing aggregate concrete blocks, they should ensure that the construction products are fit for intended use and the conditions in which they are to be used. Appropriate specifications and choices will help secure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2022, which will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing, is currently going through the legislative process in the Oireachtas and is expected to be enacted shortly.\u00a0 Its main objective is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations in the construction sector which will benefit consumers and the general public. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register is critical for the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900077#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900077#WRD01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900077#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[34637\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900077#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will examine and expedite a passport application for persons (details supplied);

The purpose of this DEIS specific funding is to support the objectives of the DEIS programme, including retention, attendance, literacy and numeracy. The DEIS programme provides a suite of supports to specifically support educational disadvantage. DEIS grant funding and supports are applied equitably across all DEIS post-primary schools, irrespective of the patronage or governance model for a given school.<\/p>  <p>  DEIS supports are targeted at supporting the educational outcomes of those pupils most at risk of educational disadvantage, and are not intended to cover the day to day costs of the school as is the case with capitation funding.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to the funding arrangements for the day to day running of post primary schools, these arrangements reflect the sectoral division of the second-level system.\u00a0 Funding provided to schools in the ETB, Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sectors is primarily based on budgets determined by my Department. Voluntary Secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme are funded by way of per capita grants. At the core of these arrangements is reliance upon capitation as a key determinant of funding and enrolments are the main driver in the level of funding provided.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are historical arrangements in place whereby the Capitation Grant funding for Voluntary Secondary Schools is reduced by the School Salary grant. This deduction amounted to &euro;563 per teaching post.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that up to &euro;21m has been provided in equalisation funding in the period up to 2009. Furthermore, as agreed with the Joint Managerial Body (JMB),\u00a0 future improvements in equalisation funding is to be directed in the first instance at the elimination of the School Salary grant deduction from the capitation payable to Voluntary Secondary Schools.\u00a0 Therefore, Budget 2020 provided additional funding to cater for a 20% reduction in the School Salary Grant deduction from 1 September 2020. This brought the deduction down from &euro;563 to &euro;450.40 per whole-time equivalent teaching post.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to have secured further funding in Budget 2022 to complete the elimination of this deduction.

This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education across primary and post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. Topics covered at post-primary include: sexual harassment; healthy and unhealthy relationships; consent; domestic gender-based and sexual violence; dating violence and rape.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the\u00a0development of inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and SPHE across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships.<\/p>  <p>  Following a review of RSE in schools across all stages of education the NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools.  <\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE\/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised recently as important for young people's education - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationships, how to interact safely and respectfully the influence of the media on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum is progressing. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. \u00a0 A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council by the summer, with a public consultation to follow when schools return in September. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in schools from September 2023. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  I have announced a review of the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and procedures on bullying.\u00a0 This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying, gender identity bullying and sexual harassment.<\/p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published in August 2021.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Justice in formulating and implementing the Third National Strategy for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (DSGBV). Proposed actions for my Department include enhancing understanding of gender and relationships, and enabling frontline professionals and support staff, with the assistance of the support services for teachers, to have the necessary analysis, skills, and expertise to identify potential DSGBV dangers and make appropriate preventative interventions.

It provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help him\/her to create and maintain supportive relationships and become an active and responsible citizen in society. Through an SPHE programme that is planned and consistent throughout the school, children can develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their decisions and actions both now and in the future. As children progress through an SPHE programme, they will encounter a wide range of issues. These will include substance misuse, relationships, sexuality, child abuse prevention, prejudice and discrimination. The SPHE curriculum is structured in such a way that these issues are not explored in isolation; rather the emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all these issues, with specific information provided where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The SPHE Curriculum is divided into three strands Myself, Myself and Others, Myself and the Wider World at all levels, where topics are dealt with in an age and stage appropriate manner. From third class, under the area of &lsquo;Myself&rsquo;, through the strand unit &lsquo;Taking Care of My Body&rsquo;, children should be enabled to understand and appreciate what it means <\/p>  <p>  - to be healthy and to have a balanced lifestyle,<\/p>  <p>  - to realise that each individual has some responsibility for his\/her health and that this responsibility increases as he\/she gets older <\/p>  <p>  - to be aware of the dangers in using tobacco or alcohol and explore the reasons why people may choose to smoke or drink <\/p>  <p>  -to distinguish between legal and illegal substances, identifying those that are most commonly used, and examine and understand the effects they can have alcohol,<\/p>  <p>  - explore some of the reasons why people smoke, drink alcohol, misuse any kind of substances or take drugs that have no medical use.<\/p>  <p>  - The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools. The immediate focus\u00a0of the work of the NCCA has been\u00a0on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE\/RSE may be approached in a\u00a0comprehensive\u00a0way that meets the needs of young people today.<\/p>  <p>  - The primary curriculum is currently undergoing a period of review and redevelopment, lead by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). There are calls for the primary curriculum to do more. To include new areas of learning such as: Education about Religions and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics, coding and computational thinking, and modern foreign languages, and more time for existing areas such as wellbeing (including SPHE and PE). In February 2020 the NCCA published the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework for public consultation. The impact of COVID-19 required changes to the consultation timeline, with a revised two-phased approach which was completed by the end of February 2022. It is intended that the finalised document will be sent from NCCA to the Minister for approval in early 2023 with publication by end Q1 2023. This framework will then guide the NCCA&rsquo;s work in developing a specification for each curriculum area. It will be the 2025\/26 school year before these are introduced to schools<\/p>  <p>  -Other programmes, such as the Garda Schools Programme deal with issues relating to substance misuse, including alcohol.

SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in junior cycle.

Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.<\/p>  <p>  Relevant topics in SPHE include student decision-making skills and safety and protection. Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making. In respect of safety, students&rsquo; ability to assess the consequences of risky behaviour is developed.<\/p>  <p>  The SPHE curriculum is currently being redeveloped across all levels.

This law for the first time criminalises the sharing of intimate images without consent, regardless of the motivation for doing so. People convicted of this offence can face penalties of an unlimited fine and\/or up to 7 years imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  To make it easier for victims to report and have this illegal content removed, my Department, along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, established a partnership with Hotline.ie to create an online reporting facility for intimate images shared without consent. This enables victims of intimate image abuse (IIA) to report it to Hotline.ie and request the assistance of Hotline.ie who will engage with the relevant service provider to seek the removal of the illegal content reported. At the same time, if a victim requests, Hotline.ie will pass all relevant information to the Garda&iacute; so that a thorough criminal investigation can be conducted with a view to prosecuting offenders. It is of course open to a victim to report directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if they choose.<\/p>  <p>  While there is presently no specific legislation in this jurisdiction compelling service providers to report illicit content, I am informed by the Garda authorities that many do so voluntarily, particularly service providers with headquarters in the United States of America who report via the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) based in Washington. However, there are also certain service providers who do not engage with and do not respond to law enforcement requests.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the European Commission&rsquo;s new proposal, published last month, on tackling child sexual abuse online.  This draft Regulation sets out comprehensive new requirements on online companies to assess and mitigate the extent to which their platforms are being misused for the purposes of child sexual abuse, both in terms of hosting material and the exploitation by abusers of their services for the purposes of grooming children.  The Regulation will introduce provisions requiring companies to detect and report such material.  It will also create a new EU Centre to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement agencies across the Union in tackling online child sexual abuse.  I expressed my strong support for this new proposal to the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, at the recent WeProtect Global Alliance summit on child sexual abuse in Brussels.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works in close cooperation with other international police services and agencies in the prevention and detection of illegal content online, where those activities identify suspects based in Ireland. Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working with Internet Service Providers to examine and put in place operational URL blocking initiatives.  Once operational, it is envisioned that these initiatives will deter potential offenders from accessing child sexual abuse material (CSAM).<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy maybe aware, Ireland ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (known as the \"Lanzarote Convention\") on 21 December 2020. The Convention entered into force in relation to Ireland on 1 April 2021. Part 2 of the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 which strengthens the law relating to the sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography, and criminalises the use of information and communication technology to facilitate such exploitation, ensures the State&rsquo;s full compliance with criminal law provisions in the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is important to acknowledge the work of my colleague, Minister Catherine Martin, T.D., who has recently published and initiated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. The Bill will establish a Media Commission to replace the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and provide for the appointment of an Online Safety Commissioner who will oversee the establishment of a regulatory framework for online safety.<\/p>  <p>  Under the framework, the Online Safety Commissioner will devise online safety codes requiring certain designated online services to operate appropriate systems and processes to minimise the availability of some of the most serious forms of harmful online content. Such content will include certain criminal material, including a number of relevant offences from the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 and the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. It has also been agreed between my Department and Minister Martin's Department that the Media Commission will have a role in respect of certain regulatory functions arising from the EU Terrorist Content Online Regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900081#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wards of Court","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900081#WRH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[34806\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900081#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on the number of wardship applications made by the HSE in each of the five years up to 2022; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>Management of the courts, operational matters and logistical functions are the responsibility of the judiciary and Courts Service, which are independent in exercising their functions under the Courts Service Act 1998 and given the separation of powers in the Constitution. <\/p>  <p>  The High Court has jurisdiction in wards of court matters and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April\u00a0the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website:\u00a0www.hse.ie\/eng\/staff\/resources\/hr-circulars\/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 24 June, 45,882 eligible\u00a0HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes applications payments made in Section 38 organisations, many of whom have also completed payment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE\/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE\/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<\/p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);#<\/p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<\/p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;<\/p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help\/home care\/home support) contracted to the HSE;<\/p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;<\/p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.<\/p>  <p>  The Government\u00a0is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc\/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900082#WRJ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances","counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900082#WRJ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":475,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[34661\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900082#WRJ04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the funding model for prosthetics and orthotics is on a national basis or is it different in each CHO; if this consists of a risk assessment to be completed by the referrer for each new application (details supplied); if so, the person or body that informs the referrer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":476,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a wide range of medical and surgical aids and appliances, including prostheses and orthoses, free of charge to eligible persons (such as medical card holders and people on the Long-Term Illness scheme) following assessment by a relevant health professional.<\/p>  <p>  These are provided through community services known as Community Funded Schemes and play a key role in assisting and supporting people to maintain everyday functioning, and to remain living in their homes and local community. <\/p>  <p>  Each Community Health Organisation (CHO) operates processes for the allocation of funding for medical and surgical aids and appliances.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. <\/p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.\u00a0.

There is no means test for the LTI scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility.

In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900083#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900083#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[34671\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062900083#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to introduce regional rehabilitation services for amputees;
