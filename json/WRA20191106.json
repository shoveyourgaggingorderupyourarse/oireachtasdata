Funding for the Arts Council has been increasing steadily in recent years and it will reach &euro;80 million in 2020.  This is an increase &euro;5m or 6.7% over 2019.  The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published 10 year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work. This strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers, by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, by the impact of the arts on the creative economy, and by the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.  The additional funding will allow the Arts Council to enhance its support for all artists, arts festivals, street arts and family events.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, over &euro;7m will be available from my Department next year to support the European City of Culture, Galway 2020.  This is a significant sum to support artistic and creative activities in 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The remit of Culture Ireland, a division of my Department, is to promote and advance Irish arts worldwide thus strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s cultural profile and global reputation.  Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant Government Agencies. Critically, the work of Culture Ireland is focused on increasing career opportunities for Irish artists. <\/p>  <p>  This Budget has been framed in the context of Brexit and additional funding for our arts and culture, at a time of prudent budgetary management reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to supporting Irish arts and artists.

Work is also underway in my Department to implement the EU Invasive Alien Species Regulation (No. 1143\/2014) in the national context and legislation to do this is at an advanced draft stage. <\/p>  <p>  Under the current legislative framework, responsibility for invasive alien species rests, in the first instance, with landowners. Throughout my Department&rsquo;s 87,000 hectare network of National Parks and nature Reserves, tackling invasive species such as Rhododendron ponticum, Japanese Knotweed and Giant Hogweed is an ongoing operational matter. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2011, my Department has invested circa &euro;1.4m to tackle rhododendron clearance in Killarney National Park alone. This is in addition to separate investments throughout Glenveagh, Connemara and Wild Nephin \/ Ballycroy National Park and in a number of Nature Reserves. <\/p>  <p>  Clearance work is carried out across various NPWS sites directly by our staff and also in certain instances by contractors.  With regard to combatting these invasive species, glyphosate is one of the most effective means of killing problematic invasive plant species, and it is an essential herbicide in the control of other noxious weeds. NPWS invasive species eradication programmes over many years have mainly focussed on injection of herbicide into the plant, or application onto cuts made in the stems, rather than spraying, both of which greatly reduce the quantity used and human contact with the herbicide. <\/p>  <p>  Eradication of invasive alien species, once they become established, is usually difficult to achieve and resources are best used to promote awareness, prevent introduction of invasive alien species and, where a species has established itself, put in place effective and appropriate management measures to mitigate the effects of the species on native habitats and species. <\/p>  <p>  Raising awareness of invasive alien species and the threat that they pose to native biodiversity is an important component of my Department's work in this area. In 2018, a new stream of grant funding for local authorities was piloted.

In addition, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 include provisions affording strict protection to a number of species and habitats. <\/p>  <p>  Wildlife crime takes many forms ranging from persecution of badgers, illegal hunting of deer species, illegal hunting of hares with packs of dogs generally known as lurchers, trapping of wild birds such as native finches for illegal trade, wilfully disturbing or destroying the eggs or nests of wild birds, poisoning of raptor species and the illegal cutting of hedges during the nesting season for birds.  <\/p>  <p>  While much wildlife crime is local we should not underestimate the dangers involved in investigating it as many perpetrators have links with other more serious crime.  <\/p>  <p>  Within my Department, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has responsibility for the protection and conservation of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage, including species protection and biodiversity at national level.  The NPWS is therefore dedicated to looking after our species and habitats and NPWS frontline conservation Rangers are deployed through a regional structure.  Some of their work entails scientific research and survey work and the monitoring of compliance with national and European law in relation to nature conservation and wildlife crime across the country. The team also conduct patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of national and EU legislation and investigate reports of breaches of legislation including the various types of wildlife crime I have already described. My Department works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are also specifically empowered under the Acts to investigate alleged wildlife crime offences and to prosecute as they see fit. <\/p>  <p>  In the period 2013 to date in 2019 some 80 prosecutions were taken by my Department for breaches of the Wildlife Acts.   As far as counties Galway and Mayo are concerned thirteen individuals have been convicted of breaches of the Wildlife Acts since 2013 in these two counties.  In fact there were two recent successful prosecutions this year for illegal hare lurching by individuals in county Mayo.  While bringing perpetrators of crime to justice is important, the success of dealing with wildlife crime cannot be judged on this alone, as ensuring compliance in the first instance is clearly of critical importance.<\/p>  <p>   Given the concerns that I have surrounding the apparent widespread nature of wildlife crime, an internal Wildlife Crime Group staffed by field staff and senior Departmental officials which meets regularly most recently last week.

These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State.

Any queries in respect to such a designation should be pursued with OPW. Through its National Parks and Wildlife Service, my Department manages an extensive conservation and recreational property portfolio of some 87,000 hectares, which includes 6 National Parks.  I have no plans at present to designate any further National Parks.<\/p>  <p>  The IUCN, also known as the World Conservation Union which is affiliated to the United Nations, is the international authority which sets the criteria for the protected areas of the world. All of Ireland's six National Parks are managed as Category II National Parks under the criteria set out by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). Under this Category, ownership and management should normally be by the highest competent authority of the State and there is a minimum size associated with such designations. Accordingly, all National Parks in Ireland are fully owned and managed by the State through the National Parks and Wildlife Service Division (NPWS) of the Department. It is the policy of my Department to abide by the criteria and standards for the National Parks laid down by the IUCN.<\/p>  <p>  Our 6 existing National Parks account for circa 65,000 hectares with another almost 22,000 hectares of nature reserves and other heritage sites. The existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually. Given the resources available for capital investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National Parks in the country.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; Owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as  enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park. Thanks to the acquisition, we will be returning the area to a natural wilderness state.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership in 2017 with a view to growing tourism revenues in the rural areas where the parks are located and increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination.  One of the outputs from the partnership with F&aacute;ilte was &ldquo;Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland&rdquo;; an interpretative masterplan for the development of our National Parks and Reserves, which was published last year and sets out a road map for investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Project 2040. <\/p>  <p>  The investment in our National Parks will create memorable and meaningful experiences of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, wildlife and culture. This will be done though sensitive design and the development of authentic experiences, providing better access to nature and an increased understanding of society&rsquo;s conservation responsibilities, as well as supporting significant investment in recreational facilities including upgrading and development of the trails network, increased visitor facilities and improved signage and branding. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us protect and preserve our most fragile environments and investing in our culture, language &amp;amp; heritage provide a well-being benefit for all.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, a provision of some &euro;5million in funding, for 32 individual projects across the network of NPWS sites, was announced earlier this year as part of the Rural Regeneration Development Fund.  Therefore, while I have no plans to expand the Park network at present, my Department is actively ensuring the preservation, protection and presentation of the assets we already own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600054#WRB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"City of Culture Initiative","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600054#WRB06100"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[45443\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600054#WRB06200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of progress in respect of Galway 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1315","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>I was delighted to officiate at the launch of the Galway 2020 cultural programme on 18 September last.

The plan sets out significant investment on a phased basis over the next 10 years prioritised across 3 areas - &euro;785m for Culture; &euro;295m for Heritage and &euro;178m for our Language. The scale of the investment in our cultural infrastructure is unprecedented and will deepen our cultural and heritage foundations. It will also allow us to create world-class cultural institutions.<\/p>  <p>  This capital investment is especially important in relation to the Abbey Theatre, as the building in which the National Theatre is housed is over 50 years old and is widely recognised as deficient in the facilities it provides for artists, audiences and staff and in terms of its energy efficiency. The redevelopment will also honour the theatre&rsquo;s history and legacy, whilst matching the national theatres of other European capital cities while the Abbey Theatre&rsquo;s additional aim is to accelerate regeneration of the Theatre&rsquo;s neighbourhood to transition into an even more attractive destination for leisure, eating, drinking and shopping. <\/p>  <p>  Last week, I was delighted to announce the progression of the Abbey Theatre Redevelopment Project to detailed appraisal stage. The &euro;80m indicative investment in the project will facilitate a fitting redevelopment, contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a centre for theatre as well as revitalising a key area in Dublin city centre. The planning and construction of a facility as large as this has a significant lead-in time.  <\/p>  <p>  The project is still at an early stage but the Abbey Theatre will now engage experts to prepare the detailed appraisal documentation required under the Public Spending Code, which will include economic and financial reviews as well as risk assessments.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them. <\/p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy's question arose during the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill yesterday (5 November 2019).

The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. <\/p>  <p>  The levy was successful, as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector.

(SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

Last month, I led a Trade and Investment Mission to Japan with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland where I attended a series of engagements with industry leaders and met with Japan's Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry. This trade mission highlighted the important work of the IDA and our enterprise agencies in deepening and broadening out trade and investment links to the Asia-Pacific region and other new markets.  <\/p>  <p>  While much has been accomplished in this context, the Government remains conscious of our need to continue attracting FDI from as many different countries as possible. To diversify investment here further, we need to build awareness of Ireland as a preferred investment destination in target countries, as well as improve competitiveness and consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths in terms of talent, productivity and ease of doing business. I am confident that this approach will help boost further the number of investors here from non-traditional markets and that we will continue to see greater geographic diversity across the IDA's client portfolio. The Agency's efforts in this context are already being reinforced and supported by the Global Ireland strategy, which will build and deepen Ireland's footprint all over the world in the period up to 2025.<\/p>  <p>  While we will continue to focus on strengthening FDI from growth markets, we must also not neglect the importance of our traditional source markets. Ireland's strong track record with companies from those markets - which employ tens of thousands of people across the country - has been hard-won and is the product of decades of hard work. That is why the IDA will continue to do everything possible to sustain and grow investment levels from North America and Europe while also seeking to increase investment from growth markets. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Enterprise Initiatives","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF01300"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[45666\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the budget allocation and the number of participants for Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur in 2018 and 2019.","asker":"1333","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>The  Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition was not held during 2018.

The focus of the review provides tailored analysis and recommendations to DBEI and the Irish government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons.  <\/p><p>Areas covered include taxation, the regulatory environment, productivity challenges, skills and regional development. It also includes an assessment of the main SME-targeted programme areas, including SME workforce skills, standards adoption, internationalisation, financing and innovation.  <\/p><p>My officials have organised and officiated at stakeholder events throughout the process to facilitate detailed engagement between my Department, other Government Departments, agencies, academia, business representatives and small businesses themselves. This engagement has enabled the OECD to gain insightful understandings from stakeholders in Ireland and to develop an independent assessment of the Irish SME and entrepreneurship ecosystem at the various critical stages of the review. The OECD review draws together a wealth of expertise and analysis from across the key policy Directorates of the OECD, together with the OECD's independent assessments of Ireland's key programmes and schemes and supports for SMEs and entrepreneurs. The extent of the international good practice identified by the OECD will also provide valuable inputs to my consideration of further changes and improvements to our policy mix and supports in Ireland.<\/p><p>Testament to the culmination of the 18 month&rsquo;s intensive engagement between my Department officials and the OECD secretariat, I welcomed the OECD Deputy Secretary General Knudsen to Dublin last week, where, together we launched the Review and the accompanying SME Strategy Roadmap on Thursday 31<sup>st<\/sup>October.<\/p><p>The task at hand now through my Department, is to ensure the development of a SME Strategy which will inform Government&rsquo;s Future Jobs Initiative on how best to support and foster our indigenous ecosystem into the future. <\/p><p>The total cost associated with commissioning the OECD to carry out the review was &euro;300,000, made in three separate instalments over the 18-month period: <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>Date<\/th>       <th>Amount<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>1st   Instalment<\/td>       <td>1st June 2018<\/td>       <td>&euro;85,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2nd   Instalment<\/td>       <td>21st December 2018<\/td>       <td>&euro;115,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>3rd   Instalment<\/td>       <td>5th June 2019<\/td>       <td>&euro;100,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>&euro;300,000<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement Data","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF01900"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[45699\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of cases that were investigated or are under investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in each of the years 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019.","asker":"1333","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[45700\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of convictions that have been made by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in each of the years 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019.","asker":"1333","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.<\/p><p>Section 949(3) of the Companies Act 2014 provides that the Director of Corporate Enforcement shall be independent in the performance of his statutory functions.

It should be noted that not all investigations are of a criminal nature and the ODCE policy is to seek rectification of breaches in the first instance (where the matter is appropriate for such action).<\/p><p>The ODCE also exercised its right to make certain compliance applications to the High Court under Section 371 of the Companies Act 1963, now Section 797 of the Companies Act 2014, to secure compliance with Orders sought. <\/p><p>However, it should be borne in mind that, working within the context of a rectification policy, many issues can be addressed by exercise of powers without the necessity of bringing issues to the Courts for determination, for example: production of registers; directing the holding of Annual General Meetings; production of minutes of meetings; and regularising breaches of the director loan provisions which, in 2018, secured the rectification on a non-statutory basis, of suspected infringements of the Companies Act 2014, in relation to Directors&rsquo; loans in 18 cases, to an aggregate value of &euro;6.1m approximately.<\/p><p>The ODCE took a decision in recent years to concentrate its resources on more serious and complex investigations, the result of which is usually the submission of a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for consideration, as opposed to a summary prosecution.  It is important to appreciate that the purpose of a criminal investigation is not to secure a conviction. Rather, the purpose is to establish the facts. Thereafter, it is a matter for the DPP to determine, having regard to the facts and to potentially relevant offences, whether the direction of charges is appropriate and in the public interest.<\/p><p>In terms of prosecutions, the Director of Corporate Enforcement is only statutorily empowered to initiate summary prosecutions (i.e. prosecutions of relatively minor offences in the District Court). <\/p><p>More serious alleged breaches of company law are prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court and only the Director of Public Prosecutions (&ldquo;DPP&rdquo;) can direct that charges be preferred on indictment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Pharmacy Services","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02400"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[45591\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to deliver on the 2016 review of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, which recommended changes to remuneration structures for community pharmacy contractors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>Under section 9(13) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, the Minister for Health was obliged to carry out an annual review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates set by regulation under the Act. <\/p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the 2016 review recommended that rates set in the regulations should be left unchanged at that point. <\/p><p>The review also noted that any changes to remuneration structures should be linked to Government priorities for the health service and service or contractual developments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Regulation","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02700"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[45592\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600058#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of detained medicines that are bought over the Internet; and his views on the growing danger posed by illegally purchased medicines that typically can be of dubious quality, contaminated with unsafe fillers, have the wrong ingredients, not enough active ingredient or fake packaging.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>Between 2016 and 2018, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), with the co-operation of Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has detained over 1.8 million dosage units (tablets, capsules, vials, etc.) of medicines bought over the internet.

This will also detail the consequently revised role and function of the HSE &lsquo;national centre&rsquo;, which will determine any impact on management and administration requirements, both at central and regional level. These proposals will also outline a timeline for the establishment of regional organisations and any legislative changes required to realise the Sl&aacute;intecare vision. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department will work closely with the HSE to continue to improve management and accountability of the health system. At the same time, there will be continued engagement with all key stakeholders to ensure that the reform process does not cause disruption to services and accountability. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I want to make clear that the proposed changes to health structures are only one element among many of the broader reform plans arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare report.

It will also allow for any learning that may emerge to be disseminated throughout the health system. I can assure the Deputy and the House that any recommendations made by the review panel will be actioned by my Department, as well as the HSE in order to ensure that a similar incident does not occur again.

The Department added a further 84,500 premises to the Intervention Area where commercial investment plans previously provided to the Department had failed to materialise.

This European Commission service provides targeted support to member states implementing administrative and institutional reforms.  In this regard, my officials are being assisted by the EU-SRSS in developing proposals on the design, scope, governance, and financing costs of the CPA, which will be prepared for Government before the end of the year.  Thereafter, once the CPA design is selected and approved by Government, legislation will have to be drafted and enacted.  The intention is that work on the legislation will commence in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of a State financial incentive, while the issue of tax incentives within wider supplementary pensions is under the remit of the Department of Finance, the issue of financial incentives for private pensions formed part of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Groups (IDPRTG) Consultation on Supplementary Pensions Reform.  On the basis of the findings from this review, the responses to the Strawman consultation, and ongoing research and consultation with experts from around the world, a set of options on the design of a State incentive for AE will be brought to Government in the first quarter 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the nature and functions of the Registered Providers, the wider investment framework for AE and the pay-out phase, a set of proposals on these will also be submitted to Government for its consideration in the first quarter of 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the resources allocated to achieve this commitment, a full time &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Management Office&rsquo; (PMO) has been established within my Department.

Local authorities are also working hard to bring homes back into use by acquiring dwellings in unfinished estates, liaising with financial institutions on their vacant property portfolios and utilising CPO powers to acquire empty properties. These recovered properties aid us in the ongoing effort to meeting our commitments under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland, which sets out a range of measures to assist in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s housing needs by ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s existing housing stock is used to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also made legislative amendments in support of the reactivation of the optimum number of vacant residential properties. New exempted development Regulations which came into operation in early 2018, allow for the change of use, and any related works, of certain vacant commercial premises to residential use without the need to obtain planning permission. We also introduced Regulations late last year to provide clarity on the application of Disability Access Certificates to existing buildings when brought back into reuse.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to potentially vacant space above retail space, my Department has recently launched the Bringing Back Homes &ndash; Manual for the reuse of existing buildings, to help property owners, the public, local authorities and the construction industry to developing vacant buildings and space over commercial property. Bringing Back Homes aims to help increase housing supply as well as rejuvenate town centres and city streets. Publication of the manual was a commitment under Action 5.21 of Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness and is also referenced in the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy.   Amongst other things, the manual provides a suite of reuse options for  common building types and elaborates on the complexity associated with each option giving an overview of the technical requirements associated with creating &lsquo;over the shop&rsquo; space into residential units.<\/p>  <p>  In order to more accurately determine the levels of long-term, vacant but recoverable dwellings that can be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock, the Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the CSO and the local government sector, developed a survey methodology in relation to locating vacant housing and a pilot field-based survey was undertaken across six local authorities (Cork City Council, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, Limerick City and County Council, Mayo County Council, Meath County Council, Waterford City and County Council.)<\/p>  <p>  Each participating local authority visually inspected  approximately 1,200 homes each, recording the location of potentially vacant properties, and where possible, recording apparent reasons for vacancy and categorising each vacant home (with a view to prioritising those which are seen as most likely to be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock). To identify long-term vacancy, the pilot requires two visual inspections, six months apart, with those houses occupied between the two inspections disregarded. <\/p>  <p>  The participating local authorities have completed their work on the pilot vacancy identification survey and my Department are analysing the results of the pilot survey and is currently considering the outcomes to determine whether there would be significant value in rolling out the survey on a national basis. <\/p>  <p>While neither Cavan County Council nor Monaghan County Council were involved in the pilot vacancy survey, both have requested access to the GIS application that was used during the pilot, which will allow them visually inspect and log potentially long-term vacant properties in their administrative area, which could be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600065#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Voting","counter":528,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600065#WRN03700"},{"type":"question","counter":529,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[45637\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110600065#WRN03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many older persons, persons with long-term illnesses and those who are housebound feel angry and discriminated against due to the fact that they are unable to vote in elections and are unable to get to a Garda station to have a postal vote form verified; and the way in which he plans to rectify same.","asker":"1301","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":530,"content":"<p>Postal voting is provided for in electoral law in respect of certain categories of persons who are entered in the register of electors, including electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 66(2) of the Electoral Act 1992 provides that the receipt sent with the ballot paper to postal voters must be in the form directed by the Minister and must have printed thereon the instructions to the voter.

In particular, the 2011 Regulations transpose two key pieces of EU nature legislation: the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. <\/p><p>The main aim of the Habitats Directive is to contribute towards the conservation of biodiversity by requiring Member States to take measures to maintain or restore natural habitats and wild species listed on the Annexes to the Directive at a favourable conservation status. These annexes list habitats (Annex I) and species (Annexes II, IV and V) which are considered threatened in the EU territory. The listed habitats and species represent a considerable proportion of biodiversity in Ireland and the Directive itself is one of the most important pieces of legislation governing the conservation of biodiversity in Europe.<\/p><p>Under Article 11 of the Directive, Ireland is obliged to undertake surveillance of the conservation status of the natural habitats and species in the Annexes and, under Article 17, to report to the European Commission every six years on their status and on the implementation of the measures taken under the Directive.<\/p><p>In April 2019, Ireland submitted the third assessment of conservation status for 59 habitats and 60 species (including three overview assessments of species at a group level). A further 8 species are considered to be vagrant in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Article 17 report for 2019 is published in 3 volumes: An overview report (Volume 1), released in August 2019, provides more detail on the methodologies, an easy-to-read summary of the results and a list of contributors to the assessments. Volume 2 (Habitats) and Volume 3 (Species) contain the detailed reports and relevant scientific information. The report is available on the NPWS website (<\/p><p>While many habitats are still considered to be in unfavourable status, the picture for plant and animal species is substantially better, with over 70% reported as stable or increasing. <\/p><p>Article 12.1 of the Birds Directive states that &ldquo;Member States shall forward to the Commission every three years, starting from 7 April 1981, a report on the implementation of national provisions taken under this Directive.&rdquo; In 2008 a new system of bird reporting was developed similar to the reporting format under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive. This also included a transition from a three-year to six-year reporting cycle, synchronised with the reporting under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive. The first report under the revised format covered the period 2008 &ndash; 2012 and reported out on Ireland&rsquo;s regularly occurring breeding species as well as those wintering and passage species that trigger SPA classification.<\/p><p>As part of this reporting obligation Ireland submitted, on schedule, 209 season specific assessments, including assessments for all of Ireland&rsquo;s regularly occurring breeding species and a large proportion of those species&rsquo; populations that occur here during the non-breeding period, to the European Topic Centre on October 31<sup>st<\/sup>2019. Additionally a general report was also transmitted. The 209 &lsquo;species-seasons&rsquo; figure can be broken down into:<\/p><p>- 142 assessments of breeding birds (including a short report on one species, Corn Bunting, that went extinct after the Birds Directive came into force);<\/p><p>- 63 wintering accounts with the vast majority related to wintering waterbird populations; and<\/p><p>- four accounts of birds using Ireland&rsquo;s coastlines or her offshore waters on passage (i.e. three tern species and one shearwater).<\/p><p>Approximately 30% of the breeding species assessed are estimated to have remained stable or increased in abundance over the long-term. This cohort includes those relatively recent colonists with strong population growth including Little Egret, Great Skua, Mediterranean Gull, Little Ringed Plover, Bearded Tit and Great Spotted Woodpecker as well as our re-introduced raptor species of Golden Eagle, White-tailed Eagle and Red Kite (along with other raptor species Buzzard and Peregrine). These recent additions to Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird community need to be viewed in the context that almost 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird species, and where available data allows, are considered to be in long term decline. <\/p><p>The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding seabird species&rsquo; long term population trends are now reckoned to be either stable or increasing and this follows through to quite consistent population increases within the breeding seabird group (where the available data allows) over the short-term period as well. Gannet continues to increase in abundance and breeding range with a relatively new colony established on Lambay Island off the east coast. In relation to the recorded short term population increases and with regard to the many short term breeding distribution increases it is possible that the increased level of breeding seabird survey effort over the last four years or so may be partially responsible for some of these recorded gains.  <\/p><p>Of particular note are the very strong population increases with several of our breeding tern species (e.g. Roseate Tern, Sandwich Tern, Little Tern and Common Tern). At the site level it is evident that targeted conservation measures in the form of wardened tern colonies is resulting in direct and effective conservation positives.  However several of these particular species&rsquo; estimated long-term breeding range trends are in decline or stagnant which not only reinforces the need for such conservation management interventions but also clearly sets out the on-going obligation that such conservation initiatives are maintained or where necessary (especially with regard to the management of predators) improved. <\/p><p>Robust and contemporary population estimates have been produced for approximately 85% of our breeding seabird species. Work is on-going in my Department with surveys of burrow nesting seabirds (e.g. Puffin, Manx Shearwater, Storm Petrel and Leach&rsquo;s Storm Petrel) located on offshore marine islands.  <\/p><p>Due to a lack of available data we have not provided contemporary population estimates for several species, some of which trigger SPA classifications (e.g. Chough, Kingfisher) and others that we have reported in the previous Article 12 round as having undergone significant long-term declines (e.g. Red Grouse, Woodcock with both of these species on Ireland&rsquo;s Open Seasons Order). Plans to increase the monitoring effort for these species are to be prioritised over the coming years.<\/p><p>Some of our breeding farmland songbirds have been flagged in recent decades as being particularly vulnerable to the modernisation and intensification of agricultural practices. This ongoing change in agricultural practices has led to the extinction of Corn Bunting as a breeding bird in Ireland and has caused significant long term declines to species such as Yellowhammer, Whinchat and Twite for example. The latter two species&rsquo; estimated populations are now considered to be both less than 100 pairs. <\/p><p>Countryside Bird Survey data for two ground nesting songbird species which are still relatively abundant and widespread, namely Meadow Pipit and Skylark were used for this reporting round. Their preferred breeding habitats include peatlands and unimproved grasslands, and both populations are in decline with the estimated short term abundance of Meadow Pipit declining by over 12% and for Skylark by almost 11%. Over the last 40 years or so the estimated breeding range of the latter has decreased by almost one quarter. Such estimated declines are of particular concern as both Meadow Pipit and Skylark make up significant proportions of the prey base of some of Ireland&rsquo;s raptors of conservation concern including Merlin, Kestrel and Hen Harrier. The estimated short term declines for the latter two raptors are estimated to be circa 28% and 10% respectively. <\/p><p>Breeding waders as a group continue to suffer significant declines in both population and breeding range, in both the short- and long-term. Species such as Curlew, Lapwing, Redshank and Dunlin have declined by 93% or more in the long term. Certain breeding duck populations are also of concern with numbers of breeding Common Scoter continuing to decline to critically low levels. While this species&rsquo; range is stable, the population has declined 21-54% in the short-term and 61% in the long-term. The latest assessment of breeding Red-breasted Merganser (which was reproduced from the 2008-2012 reporting period due to a lack of contemporary data) estimates that this breeding population has declined 62% in the short-term.<\/p><p>The vast majority of those wintering populations assessed as part of the Article 12 Reporting process relate to wintering waterbirds. This group includes ducks, geese, swans and waders among others. Due to its geographical location, climate and wetland habitats, Ireland is an important host for hundreds of thousands of visiting waterbirds during the non-breeding\/wintering seasons. Due to the relative sizes of their respective biogeographic populations, Ireland is of international importance for several waterbird species including Whooper Swan, Greenland White-fronted Goose, Brent Goose, and Black-tailed Godwit among others. The Article 12 reporting process does not seek information on the wintering range of these species. <\/p><p>Other birds that are not water-birds visit Ireland during the winter but good data to describe them precisely is not currently available.<\/p><p>More detailed data, with regard to the numbers of winter migrant water-birds, is available in the recent Irish Wildlife Manual number 106 published by my Department's NPWS:  .<\/p><p>Information concerning Ireland's Article 12 report can be found at the NPWS website:  <\/p><p>In addition, NPWS and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency are working together with national experts and with the National Biological Data Centres North and South to produce regional Red Lists for the island of Ireland. The production of Red Lists is an action under our National Biodiversity Plans. Red Lists are published on an irregular basis, as datasets and the necessary national expertise for taxonomic groups become available. <\/p><p>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) developed the  standard Red List approach for dealing with the presentation of information on rare and threatened species.

The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published 10 year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work. This strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers, by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, by the impact of the arts on the creative economy, and by the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.<\/p><p>The cumulative impact of these funding increases is further testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the sector.  In this context, I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department.  <\/p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is a five-year all-of-government, culture-based initiative, led by my Department, that emphasises the importance of human creativity for individual, community and societal wellbeing.  The vision of the Creative Ireland Programme is to position creativity at the heart of public policy, to enable, encourage and enhance collaboration and innovation, and to create opportunities for all citizens to engage with all forms of creative activity.  <\/p><p>In encouraging new ways and means to explore, express and engage with our natural creativity, the Creative Ireland Programme aims to give autonomy to partners (such as local authorities, community groups and schools) to decide on the creative activities that speak to their strengths, preferences and local traditions.<\/p><p>Under Pillars 1 and 2 of the Programme, a range of creative activities and pursuits are supported - whether that be in what can be considered traditional artforms (such as drama, music of the visual arts), through embracing new and innovate forms of creativity (such as coding) or through new ways to engage with and explore our traditional and heritage craft activities.<\/p><p>The main source of funding for local community events and activities under the Creative Ireland Programme is Pillar 2 - 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community'.In 2019, total funding of &euro;3m has been allocated to all local authorities to enable them to support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county.  Each local authority has established a Creative Ireland Co-ordinator and a local Culture Team to manage and allocate this funding in accordance with local needs and in line with their own, individual 5-year Culture and Creativity Strategy. The projects funded cover a broad range of topics including archaeology, architecture, biodiversity, crafts, heritage, drama, dance, literature, music, storytelling and the visual arts. <\/p><p>In addition to this core funding, the Creative Ireland Programme has also allocated &euro;15,000 to each local authority outside of Dublin and &euro;75,000 each to the four local authorities in Dublin to develop a special programme of events for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g &ndash; the national day of creativity for children and young people.  Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g took place on 15th June 2019 and included a range of arts based activities for all ages.  Already this year, nearly 1,400 projects have been supported by the Creative Ireland Programme.<\/p><p>In July of this year, I announced the completion of a review of the Percent for Art scheme.  The outcome of this review led to changes to the scheme&rsquo;s bands and limits which will make significantly increased funding available to the creative community.

Applications are now being invited for the Cultural Capital Scheme which will focus on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres that operate as not-for-profit organisations.  This new scheme places an emphasis on the reduction of carbon footprints to dovetail with the Government&rsquo;s action on climate change.  Projects providing additional capacity for artists and artistic production particularly in arts centres will also be favoured. The Scheme builds on the success of the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 which saw grants allocated to 134 organisations in 26 counties to refurbish and enhance their facilities.

Youth Theatre Ireland (YTI) is the national development organisation for youth theatre, supporting a network of youth theatres who deliver year-round programmes of drama workshops and performance opportunities to young people aged 12-21.

The Creative Ireland Programme has partnered with Sing Ireland whose mission is to develop and support all forms of group singing in Ireland, by providing quality experiences through activities and by supporting the work of their members and the wider choral sector to progress this action.

A number of other pilots and initiatives have been developed and\/or supported to help deliver the Creative Youth Plan and some further information on a selection of individual initiatives is also outlined below. <\/p><p>1.The <b>Creative Schools<\/b>pilot is one of the flagship projects of the Creative Youth Plan, which seeks to enable the creative potential of every child and young person. Creative Schools aims to understand, develop and celebrate the arts and creativity as a core aspect of school life. It strives to foster children and young people&rsquo;s creativity, potential and participation in the arts as an integral part of their education. The initiative recognises that the arts are a powerful means through which children and young people can explore communication and collaboration, stimulate their imaginations to be inventive, and harness their boundless curiosity.<\/p><p>1.Schools selected to participate in the programme do so on a two-year cycle - the first to support them in developing a feasible creative plan for the school, and the second to enable them to implement this plan.  Each participating school is provided with access to a Creative Associate, who are essential in embedding inspirational and sustainable creative practices in teaching and learning.  Creative Associates are a mixture of practising artists and teachers with an understanding of creativity and its potential to transform the lives of children and young people. In addition, each school is allocated an annual grant of &euro;2,000 to implement their plans.<\/p><p><b>1. Creative Clusters<\/b>are groups of 2-5 schools, within an education centre, coming together to work on a Creative Project.  A facilitator provided by the Education Centre will help them formulate the plan and &euro;2,500 is provided to each cluster to put this plan into action.  Projects include coding, drama, Green Forest and Wellbeing.<\/p><p><b>1.Continuing Professional Development<\/b>(CPD) for teachers and for artists working in partnership with teachers is crucial to the long-term success and sustainability of the overall Creative Youth Plan. In order to achieve the long-term objective of cultural and creative education, it&rsquo;s necessary to build a critical mass of education and arts professionals who are versed in the theoretical frameworks of arts and creativity education, and equipped with the skills and techniques for delivering programmes.  CPD programmes continue to be rolled out across Early Years, Primary and Post-Primary settings.<\/p><p><b>1. National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals<\/b>(NAPD) &ndash; a representative body for Principals and Deputy Principals &ndash; operates the Creative Engagement programme in Post Primary settings.Under the programme, grants up to &euro;2,000 are awarded to schools for art education under clearly set criteria and undertaken on a jointly funded basis with the school involved.  The projects involved allow art practitioners to work with students in schools to allow students to produce work in visual art, music, theatre, dance, film and poetry. This programme strives to encourage creativity and initiative, and complements curricular learning in the arts, heritage and culture.
