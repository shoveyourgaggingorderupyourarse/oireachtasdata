We now have a situation where community, hospital, primary care and mental health care services across the country are simply not able to cope with the demand.  Some 7,781 admitted patients were on trolleys in the month of August alone.  That is up 27%.  There were over 440 people on trolleys in our emergency departments yesterday, admittedly down today to 345, but still an extraordinary figure for this time of the year.  Over 65,000 people were treated on trolleys during the first six months of 2017.  By any credible stretch of the imagination, the T&aacute;naiste now has to accept that this Government, despite giving itself applause and claps on the back about the biggest budget it has provided for the health  care services, is not providing the health care services that are required.<\/p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that this Government has been lethargic, at best, in trying to deal with the challenges in the health care services, and primarily in the acute hospital setting?  We now have a situation where, week on week, we have record after record being broken with regard to overcrowding in our emergency departments and the number of people in outpatient and inpatient services is now nearly at 700,000.  Our acute hospital system is in crisis.  Couple that with challenges in primary care and we are going to have a winter in which there will be an awful lot of pressure on our emergency departments.  Elderly people in particular will be waiting inordinate periods to be admitted to hospital.  Is it now time for the Government to accept that its winter-proofing systems that have been in place for the last number of years have been an abject failure and that it requires a hands-on approach from the Minister and Government along with the Department of Health to deal with these challenges?  I do not think it is good enough for the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and others to stand up and say they are providing the largest budget in the history of the State for health care.  If they are, they are failing, because it is simply not providing the services that are needed and required across the major areas, namely, the acute, primary, community care and mental health areas.  By any credible yardstick, this Government's health system or health services are failing on a daily basis.<\/p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that there needs to be a refocusing by the Minister for Health and the Government to prioritise the key areas of the acute hospital, the emergency departments and our primary care setting to ensure that, come the winter, we will not have hundreds of people on a daily basis in our emergency departments across the country, and primarily elderly people, which seems to be the case at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100003#A00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1505999100,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for observing the time.

For example, reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of the Government's key priorities.  It is for that reason that &euro;20 million was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in the budget, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, the Minister for Health, as the Deputy will be aware, asked the HSE to develop waiting list action plans for 2017 in the areas of inpatient care, which the Deputy mentioned, and also scoliosis and outpatient services.  The inpatient, the day-case and the outpatient plans focus on reducing the number of patients who are waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and day-case treatment or for an outpatient appointment by the end of October.<\/p>  <p>  Working very closely with the HSE, the NTPF has been implementing waiting list initiatives to provide treatment for those who are waiting longest on the inpatient day-case waiting list.  The August 2017 day-case and inpatient waiting list figures which were published at the beginning of September show that the total number of patients waiting has fallen by over 2,000.  Every case of a person waiting is one too many but the Government is focusing on the range of initiatives which are making a difference and will make a difference in the long term.  These include, of course, the bed capacity review which is really important and the GP contract so that we can have more focus on primary care centres.<\/p>  <p>  Let me give Deputy Kelleher the statistics.  Some 23,000 patients have come off the inpatient day-case waiting list and over 81,900 patients have come off the outpatient waiting list.  Also, 237 scoliosis surgeries have taken place.  The NTPF is rolling out the day-case initiative as well.  That is focused on those waiting longest for day-case treatment.  Right now, 2,000 patients have accepted an offer of treatment from the NTPF.  All those initiatives are beginning to have the kind of impact we want to see.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelleher also mentioned the winter initiative.  There is a range of initiatives to deal with the very real increase in referrals that takes place in the winter period.  Following on from last year's winter initiative plan, the HSE, in conjunction with the Department of Health, developed a roadmap for improving the patient experience and to reduce the number of patients waiting for admission on trolleys in order to provide a better response.  Each of the hospital groups has been working to progress a very proactive integrated approach around winter resilience planning for 2017-2018 to ensure that specific plans are in place for those predictable peaks of pressure that the Deputy has spoken about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100004#B00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1505999100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The day-case reductions are because of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the intervention which is part of the supply and confidence arrangement.

It is proof that if there are imaginative ways, issues can be addressed.  When one looks at the day-case waiting list, there is a reduction solely because of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulties are in the emergency departments on a continual basis.  The reason I raise this is we are now in September and if the trends continue, we will have significant problems in December, January and February - during the winter months.

We now have a situation where the primary care services across the country simply cannot cope.  The idea that one would get an appointment the same day with one's local GP is now a thing of the past.  They are overwhelmed and under-resourced.  If the T&aacute;naiste could, she might just revisit the two issues of addressing the pressure points in the acute emergency departments and to try to come up with imaginative solutions to support primary care, primarily the GPs, so that they do not have to refer patients to hospitals as much as they are forced to at present due to lack of resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100004#B00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1505999100,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I repeat that the development of new primary care health centres is a priority for the Government.

The renegotiation of the GP contract is a key part of dealing with the pressures that are very evident in GP practices throughout the country.  Attracting and retaining staff in GP practices must also be a focus in order to ensure we will have local primary care centres.  There is an absolute focus on the development and opening of new primary care centres throughout the country to deal with the pressures.  Appropriate referral is obviously one of the key parts, but there are also the initiatives that have been taken in different hospitals.  I point to what is happening in Beaumont Hospital as an example in that regard.  It is very clear that there are hospitals which are dealing with the huge pressures they are under by developing new systems of management.

Instead of focusing on the crises in the health service and the provision of housing, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are engaging in a sham fight over how best to introduce unaffordable and reckless tax cuts.  It is the same old Fine Gael backed by the same old Fianna F&aacute;il.  We all know that the best way to give a break to those struggling to make ends meet, pay rent and keep a roof over their heads is not to give a tax break to put a few measly euro back in their pockets, a few measly euro that would do precious little to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis that is ruining so many lives.  It is very clear that the best way to give low and middle income workers a break is by building decent public services.  It is done by investing in the health system, delivering social and affordable homes at a level which matches the scale of the housing emergency and ensuring those with disabilities can access proper and dedicated services.  <\/p>  <p>  A responsible Government would reject the policies that have led to the decimation of essential services.  An irresponsible Government is one that opts to make tax cuts when public services are crumbling and people are suffering.  This is not just auction politics but also short-sighted and destructive politics.  The Government is so deluded and out of touch that it believes this is its route to electoral success.  It is about trying to buy votes.  However, the people whom the Government is trying to buy off will not be bought off so cheaply.  It has it wrong again.  Frankly, it is incredible that tax cuts versus investment in public services is even a matter of debate.  The facts on the ground, in communities and our families, should have settled that argument already.  The vast majority have had their fill of auction politics.  They want and demand decent public services, for which they are crying out.  They want children out of hotel rooms and in homes.  They want patients off trolleys and waiting lists.  They want to have the opportunity to buy their own homes.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the limited fiscal space, will the Government make the necessary investment in public services or will it insist on tax cuts that would further decimate the State's ability to respond to these crises?  It cannot do both.  Choosing tax cuts over investment in public services in the budget will give the clearest evidence yet that the Taoiseach, much like his predecessor, is not serious about tackling the issues which are impacting on the lives of ordinary people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100005#C00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1505999400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The first thing we want to do is make sure we continue the economic progress the country has seen.

To say the least, this is well in excess of the current salary of &euro;180,000 for the post which most people would consider a high one.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to think seriously about this proposal.  I particularly ask her to consider whether, if it was agreed, it would exacerbate the debate about high pay levels in the public service and impact on public sector pay policy generally at a particularly delicate time.<\/p>  <p>  There is no current review of top level pay in the public sector.  The priority, rightly in my view, is the unwinding of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation rather than a special top level salary increase.  The current salary for the position of Garda Commissioner of &euro;180,409 is graded at general secretary level 3, while the top level service payable to anybody in the public service is currently &euro;190,000, which is the salary the most senior Secretaries General and the Taoiseach enjoy.  If the salary for the next Garda Commissioner was increased substantially in the way that has been suggested, it is certain that the Judiciary would demand a similar increase for the Chief Justice or members of the Supreme Court and that would spread across the ranks of the senior Civil Service.  The ripple effect would continue across all grades.  For example, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has argued that the recruitment difficulties for nurses can only be adequately addressed through pay.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has made much the same point about vacancies both at consultancy level and in general practice.  The Government has already committed to a review of recruitment in the health sector.  Conceding an increase of this magnitude to the new Garda Commissioner would completely undermine arguments that might be made for all the other sectors who are in a queue to have significant pay increases. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I agreed two years ago that a new method of pay and conditions for senior officeholders would be put in place.  I did so in response to calls for pay increases from the Judiciary at the time, which the T&aacute;naiste will well remember.  I did so deliberately to ensure that no one individual or cohort would be able to unravel public pay policy.  Will the T&aacute;naiste advise whether the Government has now abandoned the commitment to a structured mechanism in deciding public pay at top level in the public service?

The Deputy quoted a salary figure, but certainly there is no decision by the Government regarding that figure, regardless of what reports may have indicated in that respect.  Clearly, the issue of recruiting the very best candidate is important and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is also examining the kinds of skills that are needed to run a large-scale, 21st century policing service, and it will be giving the Minister for Justice and Equality its views on that.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to structured mechanisms.  The best structured mechanism recently was the agreement on public sector pay.  There is no question of abandoning the structured mechanisms that we have.  However, there is an issue with some jobs and there is some flexibility to attract the right candidate, whether that is to run aspects of our health service or other areas.  That will always be dealt with in a careful away.  I take the Deputy's point about the danger of setting precedents and changing the approach to top level pay in the Civil Service and elsewhere but, clearly, there are recruitment difficulties, about which every Member will be well aware, given the competition for people.

They have stated we should insert a right to housing into the Constitution, but the Government plans to bury that proposal which was supported by 84% at the Constitutional Convention in 2014.  It wishes to \"further consider\" the matter, but people cannot even agree on what committee should consider it.  The Government indicates that it should be the finance committee; Deputy Barry Cowen has argued that it should be the housing committee, while Deputy Marc MacSharry has indicated that it should be the justice committee.  It sounds to me like they want the issue to be buried in any committee instead of agreeing to the proposal and inserting a right to housing into the Constitution.  It is shameful.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to seriously reconsider this decision and send a signal from the D&aacute;il today that human beings living in this state have a right to be housed in dignified, affordable accommodation and not be forced into the tragic circumstances in which so many find themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100008#F00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506000900,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I do not have the information sought on the individual mentioned by the Deputy, but the thoughts and sympathy of this House go to that person and his family in what are absolutely tragic circumstances, as noted by the Deputy.  It is because we believe people have a right to housing that we are taking the range of actions outlined last night in the House by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, with reference to the Bill.  The recommendation from the Government is that the matter should be referred to the finance committee for further discussion on the approach to be taken.<\/p>  <p>  Taking the key point about providing housing for individuals, that is clearly what the Government wants to and is determined to do.  It is why the budget is what it is, with billions of euro to be allocated in the next few years.  It is why the budget to tackle homelessness has doubled since 2014, rightly so.  It will be more than &euro;100 million.  The Department and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, are working very closely with all of the voluntary housing agencies.  The vast majority of the recommendations they have made to the Government are being implemented.  That is what they will state about the approach taken to dealing with homelessness.  They are supplying many of the extra emergency beds which are now available and which will be made available in the next few weeks.<\/p>  <p>  We have also taken the decision to establish family hubs on a short-term basis in order that families and children can be in better accommodation, with more support services to help them than they would have in emergency hotel or hostel accommodation which is seen as a temporary solution until social housing comes on stream.  The Deputy knows that there will be over 21,000 new builds next year, of which, as the Taoiseach stated yesterday, a quarter will be social houses.  We will also focus on affordable housing, although clearly that will not happen overnight.  We will use every resource we possibly can to meet the housing needs of the people.  It is a priority on which the Minister is absolutely focused.  Every action that can be taken to help people is being taken.  That is why 80 people per day are being given a housing solution to meet unmet housing needs.  We must remember that that is happening also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100009#G00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1506001200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>With every Government announcement and policy change over the past three years, the housing crisis has gotten worse.

Why would a proposal to enshrine the right to housing as a basic human right be referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach three years after the Constitutional Convention said that it should be put in the Constitution?  Perhaps the motive was revealed when I asked the Taoiseach yesterday why the Government is not supporting that proposal and he said he did not believe that everyone should be housed for free.  What on earth was the Taoiseach talking about?  Who is housed for free in this State?  Does that statement not reveal a deep-seated prejudice against people who rely on social housing and would pay their rent but cannot get social housing because the State fails to provide it?

There still should be a system whereby there is a full examination of the various employments individuals were in over their working life span.  That enabled the Department to make a determination that if persons did not have contributions to show for that period, they were accredited with the contributions and, as a result, were able to qualify for a higher rate pension.  I have raised this in the House, although not the Minister or her predecessor, but over the years, that there seems to be a reluctance on the part of the relevant section to go back and include all of the employments that persons might have held to determine whether or not contributions were due arising from those employments.  In some cases, even in a reply to parliamentary question, the follow-up does not specifically deal in detail with the situation.  There have been instances in the past where up to ten contributions have been discovered, albeit late in the day, they have been brought to the attention of the relevant section and, subsequently, the individual applicant has been able to avail of the benefit of those contributions.<\/p>  <p>  We had a discussion last night about fraud and alleged fraud, etc., and I want to deal with it in some detail.  Of course, we need to be always conscious not to give the impression that the House in any way encourages fraud but there is always the question that payments, inadvertently, because they are made directly into a bank account, post office savings account or whatever nowadays as it is beneficial in terms of efficiency, do not always carry with them the information made available to the section - the information may not have been carried forward from the section or transferred to the relevant person who is responsible - with the result that the person's payment continued when he or she did not have an entitlement.  That needs to be streamlined somewhat in an effort to ensure that recipients are not faced with a bill for an overpayment through no fault of their own.  It is important because in some cases it can cause quite an amount of hardship afterwards when the individual is faced with this request for repayment.  Of course, the applicant will be aggrieved because he or she did not cause the problem in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of issues I will address in the remaining minute and a half.  There will be an opportunity to look in detail at the issues that need to be dealt with in quite an amount of the social welfare legislation and to look at anomalies and to deal with them because they have been in need of review and revision for some time.  There are many traps whereby people are excluded from the system.  I do not want go into any great deal on it because I hope to deal with it again under a different heading.  I refer to the question of the spouse or partner who, even though he or she worked to a considerable extent in a business and made a major contribution, does not qualify for a non-contributory pension at all because his or her spouse may have a private pension.<\/p><p>There is a need to review those particular glitches which cause problems for some people of pension age.  At a vulnerable time in their lives, such people need a bit of reassurance and I hope the Minister will be able to take the opportunity to evaluate the position and address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100017#Q00700","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1506005100,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1506005100,"counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100018#R00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","time":1506005100,"counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100018#R00500"},{"type":"question","time":1506005100,"counter":162,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[39915\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100018#R00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will expand on the announcement made by the Taoiseach regarding the Government's plans to double Ireland's global footprint by 2025; the implications for his Department and preparations made for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The ambition set out by the Taoiseach to double Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025 reflects the scale and the complexity of the challenges we face in the years ahead.

It must also include a renewed commitment to the fight against global poverty and hunger, protecting human rights, and to United Nations peacekeeping efforts.  Now, more than ever, Ireland needs a strong voice internationally to promote our values and interests.  We are determined to play our part in support of multilateralism at this time of significant global instability, as reflected in our candidature for membership of the United Nations Security Council in 2021\/2022.<\/p>  <p>  Following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has begun to examine options to expand significantly our footprint and influence internationally, in consultation with other Departments and agencies.  This includes augmenting our existing diplomatic presence overseas as well as, in some cases, opening new missions where most impactful.  At the same time we have to ensure that the vital service and policy supports at headquarters are up to the task.  Any additional expenditure must be consistent with value for money principles and provide clear benefits for the State.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions will also be guided by Ireland Connected, the trade and investment strategy launched last March.  This whole-of-Government framework provides direction for trade and investment priorities to 2025.  At its heart is the need for policy alignment, co-ordinated action and complementarity in delivering our goals.  These include greater investment, tourism and trade, stronger links with our diaspora and enhanced global visibility. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100018#R00800","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1506005100,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Just before Deputy O'Brien responds, I am sure the House would wish me to congratulate the Minister of State on her recent marriage and to wish her every good health and happiness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100018#R00900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1506005100,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100018#R01000","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1506005100,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I was going to be very difficult with the Minister of State.

With all due respect, I know the Minister of State is stepping in for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, today but the response she has given is pretty much the same response I received to a parliamentary question last week.  I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach of a commitment to increase our diplomatic and business footprint across the world.  Currently we have 61 embassies, seven multilateral missions and 11 consulate generals.  We have just over 80 offices across the world and the Taoiseach has said that he wants to double that.  If we double that, we will have 160 offices.  What plans have actually been put in place?  What costings have been done?  Are there any priorities and if so, where?  He said that the time span runs to 2025.  When will we see the first new embassies open?  I very much fear that this is just another one of Leo Varadkar's announcements, made for publicity.  He was in Canada with his friend and he announced that he was going to double our global footprint.  We have asked several serious questions.  While we welcome the announcement, we are trying to get a handle on whether there is anything behind this but in this instance, there does not appear to be.  I want to know what meetings have taken place between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Taoiseach.  Have we any draft plan?

We have 961 diplomatic staff employed abroad and have relations with 178 different countries.  When the Taoiseach speaks about doubling our footprint, that does not necessarily mean doubling the number of offices or doubling the budget.  It is about ensuring that what we have currently is working and that we can make things work more efficiently.  For example, in a city where we have four or five different offices operating in four or five different buildings, we might be able to make that work better by bringing everybody together and making sure they are connected properly.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the time frame and making that work, the Department is currently working on a review of what we currently have, what is working and what is not, as well as examining where we can expand our footprint.

It might mean a consolidation, using offices differently and so on.  What I would really like to know is whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was actually made aware in advance that the Taoiseach was going to make the announcement, given that it has massive implications for his Department.  Is work underway to identify regions, countries or markets for Ireland to expand into?  Have additional resources been allocated for next year to start this doubling of the footprint?  The response from the Minister of State today tells me that there is nothing behind this announcement.  That is not a great surprise, I might add but if the Taoiseach and the Government are committing to expanding the diplomatic footprint, they must do it and show us the plan.  They cannot just announce it when they are abroad to make themselves look good in front of another prime minister.  This is too serious.

That said, I will outline the current position.  There have been three rounds of negotiations to date, with the most recent round concluding on 31 August.  As this is the first phase of negotiations, and in line with the agreed sequencing, the focus has been on the withdrawal issues of citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement, other more technical separation issues and the issues unique to Ireland.  Both the EU and UK have used these early rounds of negotiations to clarify their respective positions, highlighting the areas of agreement and divergence.<\/p><p>Discussions on several issues have been reasonably constructive to date, with some progress being made in the areas of citizens&rsquo; rights and the other separation issues.  However, it is clear that difficult and complex issues remain, above all in regard to the financial settlement.  It is the area in which the least amount of progress has been made.  Although the UK has accepted that it will have financial obligations to honour on its departure, it has not yet advanced a more concrete position on the issue and has argued that its obligations are moral, not legal. <\/p> <p> It is imperative that sufficient progress is made on this issue, as well as on all of the other withdrawal issues, in order for the European Council to be able to make a decision regarding the opening of parallel discussions on the framework for future relations.  It will be in the second phase that trade and sectoral issues, including the question of transitional arrangements, will be discussed.  Given that these issues are of crucial importance to Ireland and our economy, the Government wants to see phase 2 begin as quickly as possible.  However, unless the UK demonstrates greater and more constructive engagement on these issues in the next two rounds of negotiations, it is unlikely that the European Council on 19-20 October will be in a position to decide on whether sufficient progress has been achieved in the first phase of the negotiations.  The Deputy will be aware that the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, will give a speech tomorrow.  While we can speculate as to what might be in that speech it is not until it has been made that we will be able to work out what implications it will have on the negotiations due to commence next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100018#R02000","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506005700,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

Dealing with long outstanding issues related to the legacies of the conflict in Northern Ireland is of the utmost importance to the Government.  A Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the all-party D&aacute;il motions on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  This year 17 May marked the 43rd anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which saw the biggest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles.  Deputy Charles Flanagan who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade participated on behalf of the Government in the commemoration ceremony that day and in addressing the commemoration ceremony he reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s determination to continue and complete our efforts to seek the truth of those awful events of 17 May 1974.<\/p>  <p>  The all-party motion on the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  The motions call on the British Government to allow access, as correctly noted by the Deputy, by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of the all-party D&aacute;il motions and has consistently raised the matter with the British Government.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, has spoken directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, about the matter and is actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on it, as are officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As part of this engagement, the Government underlines that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin and Monaghan atrocities.  The Minister has also advised the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and this House and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and will pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by the Deputy and the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100022#V01100","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1506007500,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

It is always done better between peers, namely, the elected members of two sovereign parliaments.  Not enough of this is happening.  It cannot just be left to Ministers.  It needs a concerted effort by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to look at how we can keep this at the top of the US legislators' agenda also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100026#Z00400","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1506009900,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Deputy Deasy will work under the overall direction of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ciaran Cannon.

Why do we supply Myanmar with humanitarian assistance to aid the people of Rakhine, including the Rohingya community, when they are being treated like this?

What is most shameful of all is that the winner of a Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi, is apologising for this stuff.  That is what she is doing.  She accused the Rohingya of being Bengalis and, incredibly, of burning their own homes, thus giving licence to the military, which has been doing this for years, to genocidally attack and ethnically cleanse the Rohingya in vicious Islamophobic violence, at an enormous human cost.

We know that on Saturday, 9 September, four Irish citizens, Elaine Daly, Fidelma Bonass, Joan Nolan and Stephen McCloskey, were deported from Tel Aviv in Israel.  They were deported because they were organising and travelling with a delegation of 31 people, primarily Irish citizens, on an awareness-raising visit to the West Bank.  I understand their itinerary was to include meetings with Israeli and Palestinian human rights organisations and individuals, a visit to a refugee camp and a tour of settlements, together with day trips to some of the main towns in the West Bank.  The aim of the trip was to bear witness to the everyday hardships suffered by Palestinian people as a result of the restrictions imposed by the apartheid wall, permanent checkpoints and settlements.  The other 27 members of the delegation, two of whom are present today, were allowed to continue into Israel&ndash;Palestine and they arrived back to Ireland a week ago.  The Minister accepted that we do not have a good explanation from the Israeli State.<\/p>  <p>  For all four deportations, the grounds given were considerations concerning the prevention of illegal immigration.  This is a utterly bizarre because the individuals were travelling on valid Irish passports.  An additional reason was given for Ms Elaine Daly involving considerations associated with public security, public safety or public order.  Again, this is complete nonsense.  She did not even participate in the completely legitimate protests in Bil'in in which she was accused of participating.<\/p>  <p>  The conclusion that is strongly pointed towards is precisely that the Israeli Government, at a time of increasing repression and oppression, is increasing the rate of illegal settlement-building and attempting to put an end to any possibility of a viable Palestinian state through brute force, effectively through house demolition, etc.  It does not want people to make these trips.  It does not want people to see the reality of what is happening.  In doing so, ironically, it demonstrates in a small way the absence of freedom of movement, repression and interference by security forces faced by the Palestinian people on a daily basis.  What is the Government going to do about it?  It can rightly state the explanation but that it does not really know what lies behind it.  More has to be done, however.<\/p>  <p>  I was deported from Israel four or five years ago, or maybe more, along with others.  At that time, the Irish Government said it was going to ask the relevant questions and that we would be out quickly and get back our laptops, telephones and everything else.  The authorities still have all the stuff they took from me then.  The Government did not make any very loud public pronouncements about it afterwards.  What is the Government going to do about this to illustrate the oppression facing the people in Palestine on a daily basis?  Has any contact been made with the Israeli ambassador in Ireland?  Have we had a meeting with him and asked for a clear explanation?  Has there been any mention of consequences if we do not get a clear explanation?  Can we get a commitment that we will not have these deportations in the future?  Will the Israeli Government just be able to discourage people from going to witness what is taking place and to witness the human rights abuses by deporting people in this completely arbitrary and illegal way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100027#AA01200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1506011100,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  As he knows, he Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was notified immediately by one of the persons concerned about their deportation.  They have since written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and his Department has further discussed the events with some of them to get a clear picture of what happened.<\/p>  <p>  The organiser and leader of the group has led 17 private study groups to the West Bank over a ten-year period.  The groups meet a range of Israeli and Palestinian NGOs and study issues relating to the occupation of the West Bank.  The tour leader had responsibility and, as was her usual practice, advised the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in advance of the dates and itinerary of the tour.<\/p>  <p>  Some 33 members of the group entered Israel, but four were deported.  No detailed response or reason for refusing admission to Israel was given to them other than a generic explanation that it was for immigration reasons and, in the case of the leader, because of unspecified public security or public order considerations.  No report or allegation has ever been made to the Department of Foreign Affairs, including by the Israeli authorities, of any concerns about the activities of these study groups.<\/p>  <p>  All four persons were asked about alleged previous attendance at a well-known weekly demonstration in the Palestinian village of Bi&rsquo;lin.  The group leader has stated that she has never taken part in any demonstrations in Palestine nor have any of her group's programmes included attendance at a demonstration.  I understand that two of those deported may have previously attended this demonstration while two had not done so.<\/p>  <p>  The refusal of entry may also have been on foot of Israeli legislation enacted earlier this year which provided for admission to be refused to any person who has advocated or is a member of a group which has advocated a policy of boycott regarding Israel or Israeli settlements in Palestine.  However, I am not sure that either explanation would apply to all four persons.  It would probably be best not to speculate further on what may have led to this unwelcome attention being paid to these individuals.<\/p>  <p>  Without a more specific explanation, it is difficult to do other than conclude that the exclusion of these persons contributes to efforts to suppress scrutiny and criticism of Israeli policies in the West Bank.  The Irish ambassador in Tel Aviv has already called to the Israeli Foreign Ministry and requested an explanation for this action.  We must, as a first step, allow the authorities to respond before commenting definitively and before further steps are taken with the ambassador here.  However, I am happy to restate that the Government is not aware of any concerns about the actions of these individuals or their group which would be a legitimate basis for concern, or exclusion.<\/p>  <p>  The Government does not accept the proposition that advocacy of boycotts is equivalent to support for violence.  The Government does not support trade or other boycotts of Israel, but citizens are entitled to support them as legitimate political options.  Similarly, we cannot accept that mere attendance at a legitimate and non-violent protest by Palestinians in their own village against the conditions of the occupation is a reasonable ground to exclude someone.  Any response received from the Israeli authorities will of course be shared with the individuals concerned, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade may also comment further at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100028#BB00100","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1506011100,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I welcome the fact the Government, in particular, has said it is difficult to make any other conclusion other than that the exclusion of these persons contributes to efforts to suppress scrutiny and criticism of Israeli policies in the West Bank.  That is completely accurate and is, unfortunately, precisely what is happening.  Will the Minister of State give us a timeframe in which we expect can a response from the Israeli Foreign Ministry?  We expect an explanation, and if we do not get an adequate explanation at that stage, we need to have a response to that, be it public statements or discussions with the Israeli ambassador in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I again welcome the fact the Government does not accept the proposition that advocacy as boycott is equivalent to support for violence.  That is very important in a context where, globally, including in France and other countries, there is an attempt to criminalise the expression of support for BDS.  Representatives of the Bank of Ireland came before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach today.  The bank shut down the accounts of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, one of a number of actions taken by banks around the world, it is to be presumed under pressure.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome that the Government cannot accept mere attendance at legitimate non-violent protest by Palestinians as a reasonable ground on which to exclude someone.  I refer to a statement from Stephen McCloskey, one of those who was deported.  He said he was denied entry because he had participated in a protest in Bi&rsquo;lin, a small village west of Ramallah, a year ago.  Bi&rsquo;lin has resisted the construction of Israel's illegal separation barrier, better known as an apartheid wall, on the land there for 12 years.  Irish activists, Mr. McCloskey included, joined the villagers in their weekly non-violent protest against the construction of the wall which the International Court of Justice deemed to be illegal in 2004.  In opposing the wall, Irish activists were upholding the law.  By deporting him and three other Irish citizens, all of whom were non-violent activists, Israel denied them the right to travel and freedom of expression, just as it does to Palestinians every day.  It was breaking the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100028#BB00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1506011100,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

This case is very notable in that the persons concerned may have been excluded not on the base of the actions they undertook but because of a political view they may have espoused at home.

In recent years, millions of people have marched on the streets of Barcelona to demand, in a very colourful and dignified way, the right to vote in a legally binding and democratic referendum on independence from Spain.  Just last week, on 11 September, Catalonia's national day, 1.5 million people joined the annual pro-referendum march.<\/p>  <p>  Recent polls indicate that 70% of Catalans, not all of whom are pro-independence, want a referendum.  Some will vote \"No\" in the referendum, but they all want the right to vote.  The current Catalan Government was elected in January 2016 on a legitimate and reasonable platform which stated it would establish a binding referendum on independence.  Despite the best attempts of the Catalan Government, the Spanish Government continues to deny this democratic mandate and the demands of the Catalan people for a democratic referendum.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding is that a majority of the members of the democratically elected Catalan Parliament have approved legislation to allow a binding independence referendum to take place on 1 October 2017.  Yesterday, some disturbing events unfolded in Catalan when the Guardia Civil raided the headquarters of the Catalan Government, arresting 14 high-ranking civil servants and public officers and entered the offices of at least one major political party.  That is unprecedented in recent times.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in recent days armed police have visited newspaper officers, shut down websites and raided storage warehouses and printing centres, seizing voting boxes, ballot papers and political posters.  More than 700 Catalan mayors who support the referendum have been threatened with judicial prosecution.  The President of the Catalan Government said Spain has now de facto suspended self-government and applied a de facto state of emergency.  He described the move as an unacceptable situation in a democracy, and I agree with him.  What is the position of the Irish Government?<\/p>  <p>  When elected officials are detained for political reasons and ballot boxes for a popular and demographic referendum are seized, we have to speak out.  If we do not, who will?  When newspapers are threatened and democracy is denied, surely we have to say, \"Stop.  Enough is enough.\"<\/p><p> These raids and arrests have triggered massive demonstrations, all of which were peaceful despite some provocation in some areas, and which saw tens of thousands of Catalans demand the most basic of rights - the right to vote in a democratic referendum.  In this country, we would like to see more and more people vote yet in this other part of the world, they are telling people that they cannot vote.  Thousands of people in the Basque country and Galicia have also taken to the streets in support of their Catalan brothers and sisters.  <\/p> <p> These unprecedented attacks on fundamental rights and civil and political liberties are putting democracy in Catalonia at risk.  Does the Minister of State share my concerns about these events?  Is she in any way uncomfortable or even disturbed that government departments in Catalonia are being raided and that civil servants are being arrested for purely legitimate, and I would argue, reasonable demands for a referendum on independence?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100028#BB00500","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506011700,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Ireland enjoys very close relations with Spain.  These relations are, of course, deeper and more textured than simply involving periodic government-to-government relations, developing trade ties or occasional encounters at multilateral events.  Our close friendship has at its heart an empathy nurtured by generations of contacts between our people.  What happens in Spain is, therefore, of great interest to their Irish friends here in this House and in the society we represent.  It makes complete sense that the differing opinions we are now seeing between different institutions and citizens in Catalonia and across Spain should find reflection in different opinions in this House.  This is to be expected and respected and I welcome this opportunity to set out the Government's position on this sensitive matter.<\/p>  <p>  Just last month, we were all shocked and saddened by the loss of so many innocent lives and the injuries caused to so many people as a result of the horrific attacks in Catalonia.  As the Taoiseach noted in his letter of support and solidarity to Spain's Prime Minister, attacks of this nature are both wanton and cowardly and have no place in our society.  We must continue to work together in Europe and with the international community to challenge ideologies of hatred and to uphold the values we hold dear.<\/p>  <p>  At present, we are following developments with regard to Catalonia.  We have enormous regard for the Catalan people.  Europe is enriched by flourishing national identities across this European Union.  This richness is explicitly promoted and protected in the Treaty of the European Union.  As I said earlier in the House in reply to a parliamentary question on this topic, the Government's position is that the constitutional and political arrangements in any country of the European Union are matters to be determined by their own citizens through their own democratic institutions in adherence with the rule of law.<\/p>  <p>  As I said already, clearly what happens in Spain is of great interest to us but we believe the issues at hand are domestic issues.  Political developments in democracies take place within a legal framework.  This is what protects the rights of all of our citizens.  In a reply to a Spanish MEP on this topic, the President of the European Parliament wrote recently that the rule of law is the backbone of modern pluralist societies and constitutional democracies.  Respecting the rule of law and the limits it imposes on those in government is not a choice but an obligation.  The Government and I share this view.  I believe it is for all Spanish citizens to determine for themselves, using their democratic institutions and legal safeguards, their preferred constitutional and political arrangements.  I do not consider it either appropriate or helpful that Ireland would enter the debate.  I am confident that our Spanish friends can chart their own internal political developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100029#CC00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1506011700,"counter":301,"content":"<p>It is not the first time that an Irish republican said that what happens in Spain affects us all.  Clearly, the idea of standing idly by and watching what is unfolding in Catalonia is unacceptable.  The Minister of State's response is deeply disappointing.  I do not think it reflects the views of people in Ireland.  Yesterday, we saw heavily armed police try to frustrate attempts to have a democratic referendum and to stop a democratically-elected government from carrying out its electoral mandate.  I have a problem with that.  Perhaps the Irish Government does not have a problem with it but I certainly do.  As Ireland's Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, the Minister of State should have a problem with that.<\/p>  <p>  On every level, this goes against the European values of democracy and the right of a people to self-determination.  Yesterday, three ferries with capacity for 4,000 members of the Guardia Civil docked in Catalan ports.  What did they plan to do?  Where is this leading us?  How is this an acceptable or credible response to a people's democratic demand for a referendum?<\/p>  <p>  We have seen important referendums on independence in Scotland and Quebec in recent years.  On both occasions, the pro-independence lost the popular vote but it showed how normal and important such referenda are in the democratic process.  Yesterday, I met a group of Catalans outside the D&aacute;il who told me why they were protesting against the Spanish Government's actions.  They were extremely upset about the attacks on the democratic rights of the Catalan people and I can understand that.  They pleaded with me and other Deputies to speak out and support Catalans' right to self-determination.  We have a responsibility.  We must stand up and speak out against repressive and regressive actions that threaten democracy in Ireland and around the world.  This is one of those moments.  A red line was crossed yesterday.  As Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, the Minister has a responsibility to speak out against this policy and these actions.  The people of Catalonia have the right to democratically decide their own future in a legal referendum on 1 October.  The Spanish Government should refrain from using heavy-handed tactics in an attempt to stop this democratic vote.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100029#CC00300","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1506011700,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his response.

I understand that Deputy Sherlock put it down as a Topical Issue yesterday and it was not selected.  He cannot be here today so I want to acknowledge that.  Since we last spoke about this issue on which we hoped we would make some progress, unfortunately, we have regressed somewhat in that the HSE decided during the summer not to reimburse the drug for various reasons, to which I will return in a second.  CSL Behring has been providing the drug as part of a compassionate access programme to 21 patients.  I understand that 17 of them are in this jurisdiction.  This will be withdrawn at the end of September.<\/p>  <p>  I, along with Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin and Kelleher, have written to the Minister for Health on foot of this decision and the reply we got was interesting.  The Minister outlined that the HSE suggested the drug has not proved itself to be clinically efficient.  This is where the big problem lies.  I have met the patients who are getting this drug.  I have met most of the 21 patients who are getting it and they have made presentations to Members in the AV room.  I ask the Minister to talk to John Hannon in Mallow who has been receiving the drug.  That man was breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank before he got the drug.  He had to retire early from this job as an engineer, a job he was very good at but where, unfortunately, he could no longer function.  Since he has been taking that drug, he has been functioning as a normal human being.  I ask the Minister to speak to James Coffey in Killorglin who has the combined condition of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and panniculitis, which basically rendered him bedridden for two out of every four weeks and put him in hospital for months upon months of each year.  Seven years ago, he received the Respreeza double dose, which deals with the issue, and has been living a normal life ever since.  <\/p><p>I might revert back to that particular situation because there are two other individuals in the country who suffer from the condition of combined alpha-1 deficiency and panniculitis and they are receiving a sister drug of Respreeza called Prolastin.  They receive it from the HSE and get on with their lives and I think we have to do the same for James.  We are caught in a dilemma.  CSL Behring is providing the information.  The HSE is saying, in good faith, I am sure, that the information is not sufficient.  The cost of the drug is another issue that we have to come to terms with.  In the meantime, there are 21 people, 17 of them in our jurisdiction, whose lives are being affected.  Those are the people I represent and for whom I am trying to get reimbursement for the drug over the line, to let these people get on with their lives.<\/p> <p> There seems to be more confusion in that the HSE has not been formally informed.  The drug has been provided to the Alpha One Foundation which Professor McElvaney is involved with.  The Alpha One Foundation administers and distributes the drug, and it has been informed that the compassionate access programme has come to an end.  Lest there be any ambiguity, I have asked the Alpha One Foundation to contact the Minister's office directly and confirm to him and the HSE that this drug is no longer available as of 30 September, so we really have only one week to try to sort something out, in particular for the 21 people, of whom 17 are in our jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100029#CC00600","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506012300,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy John Brassil for raising this issue.  I appreciate the sincerity with which he approaches it.  I think we can all agree in this House that medicines clearly play a vital role in improving the overall health and well-being of patients.  The pipeline for new medicines is very strong and it is estimated that in the region of 45 new molecules are due to receive market authorisation in Europe each year over the next five years.  It is vital that all new medicines are thoroughly assessed to determine both their clinical and cost effective value to ensure that resources are committed to medicines that deliver a high clinical and cost effective return.  The HSE has carefully considered the pricing and reimbursement of Respreeza through its decision-making process which was aligned with the statutory criteria set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to highlight the importance of that Act.  That was an Act that this House passed to give powers to the HSE, and not the Minister for Health, to decide which drugs to reimburse or not to reimburse.  I do not mean this in relation to Deputy Brassil directly, but if Deputies in this House have a difficulty with that, they should come forward with an alternative.  That is the law of the land.  It is the law that was passed by this House.  The HSE has the statutory power, not the Minister of the day, to decide to reimburse or not reimburse.  It is important that, as legislators, we accept the responsibility that we have in that regard and the legal reality.<\/p>  <p>  Following an extensive review process over the past 18 months, the HSE has written to CSL Behring, the manufacturer of Respreeza, advising it that the HSE will not support reimbursement at this time.  The HSE informed me that it was unable to recommend Respreeza as there is not enough evidence to suggest that patients will derive a clinically meaningful benefit from augmentation therapy with the human inhibitor.  It is not my view but the clinical view put forward by the HSE.  The HSE also considered its cost-effectiveness and deemed that the current price was not a cost-effective use of resources.  I appreciate Deputy Brassil's point in this regard.  Many in this House have heard that this drug is being provided at a much cheaper cost to other countries and it is despicable that any drug company would try to exploit our patients or our taxpayers for a higher price than it is demanding in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are a number of patients on a compassionate access scheme for Respreeza which is operated by the drug company.  Following recent media reports, it appears that the company could be considering terminating this scheme.  However, no formal notification has been received by the HSE from the manufacturer of its intention to discontinue access to this scheme.  I take the point Deputy Brassil makes about the Alpha One Foundation but I suggest that this company should come out and make a statement on this and on why, if it intends to do so, it would behave in such an unethical way.  As I have stated previously, and I hope it is something that all politicians in this House would agree on, there should be no link between compassionate access schemes and reimbursement decisions.  That is not just my view.  The World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects indicates that, in medical research involving people, informed consent requires that these subjects are adequately informed of a range of criteria including post-study provisions and that post-study provisions should be provided for in advance of a clinical trial.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness to our own Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, it is clear publicly, in its view, that there should be no link between clinical trials and reimbursement.  There is no reason this patient should not receive the drug.  While rightly raising it in this House, I would hope that we would all call on the company to comply with what is normal ethical practice with regard to decoupling clinical trials.  It should be decoupling clinical trials from the reimbursement process.  I have requested and directed the HSE to seek assurances from the relevant hospital, Beaumont Hospital in this case, that appropriate care arrangements are in place in the event that any access programme is discontinued in an unethical fashion, and that appropriate guidelines have been and continue to be followed in relation to all aspects of the clinical trial and access programme.  It is the responsibility of both the company and what is known as the investigator, in other words, the clinician, to ensure that they have considered and made arrangements for their patients, including in circumstances where the product is not reimbursed by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>   It is completely inappropriate and unethical for any company to link reimbursement decisions to compassionate access schemes.  When I attend round table meetings with other EU Health Ministers, drug companies and the drugs industry, they are at pains to tell us that there is no link between reimbursement and clinical trials.  I do not want a situation where they are using as leverage human beings who are concerned about their health and well-being.  I genuinely appreciate the Deputy's issue of concern.  I hope that in the next week, we can all work together to ask this company to behave in a normal ethical way.  I do not think that is too much to expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100030#DD00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506012300,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I have no issue with the methodology by which Professor Barry operates.  I have met him specifically on this issue and he has told me specifically that if the company comes forward with more detailed clinical information, he will look at it.  The problem I have, as I stated in my earlier contribution, is that I can see the obvious clinical benefit by meeting the patients who are getting the drug.  Something is falling between the stools here.  Is the company not submitting enough data?  Is it not presenting them in such away that it allows Professor Barry to get it over the line?  We have mentioned reimbursement.  We are led to believe that the costs of reimbursement offered to some countries is much lower than what is offered in Ireland.  All those are issues but next week, and I have absolutely no doubt about this, regardless of how poorly the company may have informed or not informed as the case may be, those patients are going to lose their drug.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister, Professor Barry, John Hennessy, who heads up primary care in the HSE, Professor McElvaney in the Alpha One Foundation and CSL Behring to sit around the table and thrash out a solution, if not the long-term solution over the provision of the drug to the general population, then specifically for those who are on the compassionate access programme.  We need to do something for those patients.  I mentioned an individual who has the double condition of alpha-1 and panniculitis.  That is critical for that particular individual.  He will be in a hospital bed in a week's time if his drug is withdrawn from him.  The likes of John Hannon and his colleagues who I met have had their lives changed.

However, we cannot have a situation where a drug company is breaking all the normal rules.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, the representative body for drug companies, does not behave or believe in behaving in this way.  There is not meant to be, internationally or nationally, a link between clinical trials, compassionate access programmes which a company puts in place and the HSE reimbursement process.  I have directed the HSE to make contact with the hospital and the clinician responsible to ensure that individual care plans are put in place for each of the patients.  My concern is for 17 patients in this jurisdiction, and 21 patients on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p> I suggest, as the Deputy has done, that the company in this case should come forward with more information.  It should reflect on the price it is seeking in this jurisdiction versus others.  While that is happening, patients should not be used as pawns.  The Deputy makes the point that while it might not be particularly relevant to the patients, it is important for the record of this House to state that, according to its annual report, CSL is a $45 billion company, with sales in 2016 of $6 billion and net profits in that year after tax of $1.2 billion.  Its CEO was paid salary and bonus of $8.1 million and the nine other directors of the management team were paid amounts ranging from $1.5 million to $3.2 million each in 2016.  That is all in its annual report.  Surely to God it can continue a clinical trial for 17 of our patients.  I ask for cross-party support in sending out that very clear message from this House while at the same time expecting the HSE to engage in respect of any further information presented to it.  That is very important and I will certainly keep in touch with the Deputy on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100030#DD00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Action Plans","time":1506012900,"counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100031#EE00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1506012900,"counter":311,"content":"<p>The Minister and I have discussed the scandal of lengthening hospital waiting lists on many occasions.  Thanks to the very great efforts of campaigners such as the Scoliosis Advocacy Network and staff in RTE, this issue has been highlighted.  It is only a tiny part of what we now refer to as the \"waiting list scandal\".  As the Minister is aware, the Government has presided over that scandal as it continues to worsen.  As is the form with this Government, people who get the opportunity to appear on RTE then find themselves in a situation where they get an answer to some of the questions they have been asking.  The Minister is looking at me quizzically but he knows that is true because it has happened on more than one occasion.  I accept fully the Minister's bona fides and that he stated he regrets that this has happened.  The Minister went on to say that this matter would now be a priority for the Government.  I am at a loss to know what would be happening if it was not a priority for the Government, but I welcome that the Minister has set himself a target.<\/p>  <p>  One aspect of the target to which I refer is a reliance on outsourcing some procedures, as I understand it, to two facilities in England and one facility in Germany.  Five children have travelled to England to have procedures.  Those children were on a waiting list of 300, so what is happening does not exactly represent making significant progress.  Five children have had procedures but, to date, the Minister has not signed a co-operation agreement with the other two facilities - the second one in England and the one in Germany - which means that we are at least three months away from any child being able to access the relevant services.  It is not simply a case that the Minister can snap his fingers and these children will be transferred.<\/p>  <p>  I have some fairly particular questions to ask the Minister.  The first relates to the theatre in Crumlin, which is only open three days a week.  That is an scandal.  If this matter was a genuine priority for the Government, that theatre would be open seven days a week to take account of the 300 children who are awaiting surgery.  I ask the Minister specifically what can be done for those children who have been transferred from Crumlin to the Mater and then back again.  It strikes me that is a way to massage the figures.  Those patients disappear off the list in Crumlin and they do not appear for a while on the list in the Mater.  When they do appear on the list in the Mater, they are then told they have to go back to Crumlin because they are not suitable for treatment in the Mater.  That is cruel.  Those patients have been waiting for years, notwithstanding the fact that it takes two years to even get an appointment.  It strikes me that there is not a plan in place that will, by the end of the year, deliver on the commitment that no one will have to wait four months for treatment.  I say this because it will take at least three, if not four, months to get these children to either Germany or England.  Their parents have not even received letters initial appointments.<\/p>  <p>  What will the Minister do for those children who are waiting.  What will he do, specifically, for the 68 children who have conditions that are medically complex?  These are not spinal fusion cases.  I understand that the majority of the spinal fusion cases will be dealt with through outsourcing.  The Minister knows well my views on that and I will not repeat them.  However, what will happen to the 68 children to whom I refer?  The theatre in Crumlin is only open three days each week.  They are being shuffled around from Crumlin to the Mater and to Cappagh and then back to Crumlin.  This is not fair.  If the Minister has a plan, I ask him to outline it.  If the targets are not going to be achieved, he should be at least honest with those children and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100031#EE00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1506012900,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for concluding right on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100031#EE00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1506012900,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this serious matter and for giving me an opportunity to update the House on the position.  I assure colleagues that improving scoliosis services is an absolute priority for both me and the Government.  I am monitoring closely - indeed, on a weekly basis - the progress being made on addressing waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE, working with a number of stakeholders, is currently implementing the action plan it developed for 2017 in order to ensure that, where clinically appropriate, no patient who requires surgery will be waiting more than four months for scoliosis surgery by the end of the year.  Both the director general of the HSE and the Children's Hospital Group have confirmed that they are committed to ensuring that no child will be waiting over four months by year end - contrary to what I sometimes read in newspapers, they recommitted themselves to that publicly in recent days - and they are focused on maximising all available capacity, both internally and externally, to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  Additional nurses are now in post in Crumlin and Temple Street.  An additional consultant orthopaedic surgeon commenced in Crumlin earlier this month.  Up to 15 September, a total of 216 scoliosis surgeries have taken place in Crumlin and Temple Street and the hospitals are committed to delivering their activity target for scoliosis services this year.<\/p>  <p>  The following important fact needs to be acknowledged because there is a great deal happening.  These hospitals have already equalled the number of surgeries that were undertaken in the whole of last year, with over three months still remaining this year to undertake further procedures.  Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals have appointed liaison officers to support patients and families during the treatment process.  In addition, a project manager and co-ordinators have been appointed to ensure the efficient and timely management of this action plan.  Since February of this year patients are also being transferred for treatment to the Mater, Cappagh and Stanmore in the UK and up to 15 September, 22 surgeries were completed in these hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE, as the Deputy correctly says, has also completed an international tender for paediatric spinal fusion procedures and three hospitals have been successful in their applications.  To assure the Deputy, two of those hospitals, the one in Germany and one of those in the UK, have already signed their contracts and begun reviewing patient files with a view to commencing treatment in October - there will not be a wait of three months.  They are telling us, as per their tenders and the contracts signed, that next month they will start treating patients whose families take up the offer of having procedures carried out in overseas hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is also developing a forecasting model to predict, on both a weekly and a monthly basis, the numbers of patients expected to have surgery by year end.  This will assist the HSE and my Department in continuing to monitor the progress made in achieving the target.<\/p>  <p>  To improve scoliosis services in the long term - I agree with the Deputy that sending children abroad for treatment is not what we want to do and that we need to do when we meet the four-month target in terms of a sustainable service in this country - the Children's Hospital Group established a co-design group, which includes scoliosis advocacy groups, to design a comprehensive contemporary and patient-centred approach to the delivery of scoliosis services.  This has provided an important and useful forum for discussing and working through issues of concern.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the overall number of patients awaiting scoliosis procedures has been reducing throughout the year and fell from 312 in February to 252 as of 15 September.  Progress is continuing in order to deliver on the HSE's four-month target by the end of 2017 in a planned, safe and sustainable way.<\/p>  <p>  Criticism of the HSE is often rife in this House and is often deserved.  In this instance, however, I assure the Deputy that everything that can be done by a range of staff - in the individual hospital, at Children's Hospital Group level and right up to the director general - is being done.  Progress is being made.  The target of reducing the waiting time to four months is ambitious and would bring us in line with the position in the NHS.  The HSE has recommitted to the target.  I will come back to the Deputy on the specific cohort of 68 patients she mentioned.<\/p><p>I am assured by the HSE that it is going to move might and mane to achieve this target by the end of the year.  That is its public commitment and we expect the executive to get on and deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100031#EE00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506013500,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I was contacted very recently by a mother whose 19 year old son was waiting for treatment in Crumlin.

He needs surgery and the doctors have said that he must have that surgery but he has now been sent back from the Mater.  She described her mood at the moment as both \"confused and angry\".

The Minister did not say anything about the operating theatre, which is only operating three days per week.  This is supposed to be a priority.  The Minister is right that sometimes we criticise the HSE where that is in order.  Indeed, sometimes we criticise the Government and individual Ministers where that is in order.  We are also capable of recognising where progress has been made but it is cruel to tell parents and their children that they will have a procedure when that does not look likely in many instances.

We had a theatre that was closed, that was not performing surgeries.  We have hired nurses, the theatre is open and we have an additional consultant.  The Deputy is right - the theatre is operating three days per week.  If it can do more, I am assured that it absolutely will but I am not going to tell people false information.  The theatre is open and is providing more surgeries.  Already Crumlin and Temple Street have done the same amount of operations this year as they did in all of last year.

The issue of planning for wind turbines has caused huge conflict across rural Ireland but particularly in the midlands, in my constituency of Laois and in Offaly.  This Sinn F&eacute;in Bill is about putting in place solutions to the problems.  Rural Ireland will be central to the production of renewable energy in this State but we need to get people in rural Ireland fully on board in order to tap into the immense and diverse supply of renewable energy, which will also provide economic growth and jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill I have put forward follows on from a previous Bill originally produced in 2014, which the Government at the time did not oppose.  I will now outline the provisions of some sections of the Bill.  Section 3 deals with the issue of local democracy.  Wind turbines can only be located in areas designated by local councillors in their county development plans.  That rule is supreme and cannot be undermined.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for greater community consultation, with the requirement to have public consultations on the effects on health, community and the environment.  Section 5 protects homes from both noise and shadow flicker, which is very important.  It provides that setback distances should be such that the noise does not exceed specified levels set down by the World Health Organisation, WHO.  Section 6 deals with minimum setback distances, with turbines over 25 m required to have a setback distance of not less than ten times the height of the turbine.  Under section 10, the developers must pay a bond for the repair of infrastructure.  A bond agreement must be entered into between the developer of the wind turbines and the relevant local authority to ensure the infrastructure is repaired and upgraded in a timely manner.  Section 11 deals with the option of co-ownership for local residents, which is the norm in many countries.  Wind turbine developers must at least offer local residents the opportunity to purchase a stake of up to 20% in the development.<\/p>  <p>  We are proposing a setback distance of ten times the height of a turbine for all turbines over 25 m high.  This gives legal protection to those families and home owners across the country, particularly in the midlands, who have been subjected to infringements by huge turbines.  Fianna F&aacute;il has previously recommended a setback distance of six times the height of the turbine, while the Government's current consultation document refers to a setback distance of four times the turbine's height from the nearest residential development, with a minimum setback of 500 m.  The All-Ireland Research Observatory, AIRO, at Maynooth University states that a setback distance of 2 km would leave 3% of the total land area of the State available for wind development.  If the landmass of the Twenty-six Counties is 70,282 sq. km, then 3% of that equates to 2,108 sq. km available for wind turbines.  I have heard the argument made that if we used the Sinn F&eacute;in setbacks, we would not be able to have wind turbines anywhere.  We have researched the issue and I can tell the Minister of State that even a setback of 2 km will leave us with 2,108 sq. km for wind development.  That figure was also quoted by Deputy Charlie Flanagan two or three years ago during a debate in this House.  That is with a 2 km setback but we are not looking for such a setback.  If the wind turbine is 100 m in height, then a setback of 1 km would suffice.  In that context, we would have multiples of the 2,108 sq. km available, which would provide wind turbines to power half of Europe.  That is the fact of the matter.  This would provide a huge level of protection and would allow wind farms to be developed in a sensible, sane and balanced way, without impinging on rural communities.<\/p><p>The argument that this Sinn F&eacute;in Bill will halt wind farm development is blown out of the water.  It is false.  For a one-off small-scale commercial wind turbine development the height cannot be greater than 20 m and, interestingly, it must be 100 m from the nearest dwelling, which is five times the distance.  We already have a specific setback distance in place for small-scale turbines but nothing in respect of larger ones.  The turbines in Mount Lucas and Ballaghmore in Laois are ginormous.<\/p> <p> On health affects, there are various reports on the adverse health affects stemming from noise and shadow flicker and a number of cases have been taken to the courts on such grounds, which means this issue is now bogged down in the legal process.  In terms of this Bill, we are trying to address the quality of life issue in respect of which, as I said, cases have been already taken.  We need to legislate for the limits set by the World Health Organisation guidelines.  The Bill also provides for greater public consultation on potential adverse health affects.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, publicly stated at the Energy in Agriculture Conference in Gurteen on 22 August that there were concerns that in the past developers were allowed to get away with not engaging with local communities and he stressed the need for early and meaningful engagement by developers with the local communities.  We agree with him.<\/p> <p> I read this week that in County Waterford people are claiming that they have to take sleeping pills because of the noise from wind turbines close to their homes.  The issue of community ownership is provided for in this Bill.  This should be optional.  This works in other countries and it can work here.  The Government White Paper on Energy references energy citizens and energy communities.  It further references \"agents of change in how we generate, transmit, store, conserve and use our energy and that communities must do this.\"  Surely, it must be the stated goal of the Department that there would be an option of buy-in and shared ownership for local communities.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that in his response.<\/p> <p> To date the State has supported the developers while the door to communities has been closed in terms of their rights.  We need to move away from that.  The only example of community ownership, of which I am aware, is the Templederry wind farm in Tipperary which I visited last year.  It is a huge success.  <\/p> <p> Like much in regard to renewable energy we lag behind other states.  In Denmark, the community option is set at 20%.  Over 50% of renewable energy sources in Germany are owned by communities, farmers and local people.  Currently, we have an outflow of money from rural communities for fossil fuels.  We continue to import almost 90% of our fuel for energy.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to turn this around by having energy sources in local communities, such as biomass, wind, hydro, solar and electricity generation in local communities, thereby creating jobs and wealth in local communities.<\/p> <p> I want to open up the broader debate on renewable energy.  Renewable energy does not mean only onshore wind.  Currently, we produce 27.3% of our electricity from renewable sources, which is good.  However, the vast majority of this is from onshore wind and this leaves us vulnerable because it is an intermittent supply.  Government policy in terms of renewables has concentrated on the single option of onshore wind.  We are dead in the water when it comes to having a diverse range of sources such as biomass, biogas, solar and other micro-generation projects and offshore renewables.  For example, Denmark produces 1,271 megawatts offshore and Scotland, a close neighbour of ours, the second Celtic nation, produces 197 megawatts offshore.  We have only one offshore project, Arklow, which is pathetic.  There is huge potential here in this regard.  While costs are higher for offshore wind, having spoken to people in the industry over the past year or year and a half since I took up this brief, I understand that cost is tumbling.  We need to re-examine this area.<\/p> <p> Biogas production can include farm waste.  We are in the crazy position that we are once again looking for a derogation from Europe in regard to the spread of slurry.  I support the call for that derogation because we have nowhere else to go.  Large quantities of pig slurry are being produced here and we have sat on our hands and done nothing in terms of trying to come up with solutions.  There is an over-concentration of slurry being spread on land such that we now have to seek a derogation from the EU.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports that proposal as a stop gap measure.  I have met the IFA on that issue.  Why are we not using slurry to produce biogas?  The only anaerobic digestion, AD, plant we have that is of any significance is the one in Kildare which is producing gas for Diageo, which is a huge company.  One farmer is supplying Diageo with gas.  He is feeding it into the grid and Diageo is buying it from him.  Why can we not have more of those plants?  Germany has 8,000 anaerobic digestion plants and Britain has 600 of them.  Britain is not even a world leader in energy but it has 600 AD plants, which is a long way off what we have.  Some Scandinavian countries, such as Sweden, source close to half of all their gas requirements from renewable sources such as biomethane.  There is huge progress to be made in this area.  A Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, representative stated that we are second last of 24 European states for producing electricity from biogas despite having a huge agriculture sector.  We now have an opportunity for a win-win.  We need to deal with the slurry issue and find a way of managing it sustainably.  If we produce electricity, we create jobs and we put money into farmers' pockets or the pockets of whoever is developing it.<\/p> <p> In regard to biomass, we must change from peat to biomass.  This is happening gradually because we cannot just shut down plants, even though some people want them closed straight away.  We are importing biomass from South America.  We need to be growing it here.  Bord na M&oacute;na launched its renewable energy document at the Ploughing Championships.  It does not have the supply of raw material necessary for its plants.  That is the problem.  In regard to solar micro-generation, there are huge planning issues, with even greater problems for grid connections for the solar industry.  The missing piece is policy by the Oireachtas.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, and his officials to look at how we can get solar connection.  We are not blessed with a huge amount of sunlight but we do have significant amounts of it.  We are blessed with long days for six months of the year.  In comparison with other countries, we have more sunlight.  In terms of the new technologies available we need to be developing solar energy.<\/p> <p> This Sinn F&eacute;in Bill is an attempt to deal constructively with this issue.  We have had two Governments in the past few years and approximately three Ministers and three Ministers of State have had responsibility for this area.  I do not blame them or anybody else for the fact that we have not yet properly addressed this issue but despite all of that we still do not have guidelines in place.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment issued a consultation document on the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, process but according to the Department officials to whom I spoke today at 12.30 p.m. that process has not yet commenced.  My understanding is it will take a minimum of six months.  I am open to correction if I got that wrong but that is what I understood from the officials.  We are not even off the blocks on this issue.  What is going on?  Does the wind farm industry have somebody's arm twisted up their back?  What is going on?  To whom is the Government listening?  Wind farms are being built without proper planning regulations or guidelines in place.  The wind farm developments steam on and there is no protection for the environment or local communities.  All of the emphasis is on the wind industry, with no focus on the wider range of renewable sources available.  This Bill presents an opportunity to deal with the issue.  I am aware that it now requires the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, process.<\/p><p>Some campaign groups pointed that out a few years ago.  They had copped on to that.   I heard them say that four or five years ago.  Will the Minister arrange for that process to be up and running?  Legislation also needs to be introduced.  We are putting forward a practical solution.  We are trying to be constructive.  We want to get jobs into rural areas.  We want to generate electricity in rural areas from a range of sources.  Six or seven sources, along with wind energy, can be used.  The source does not have to be solely wind energy, but we need protection from huge wind farm developments.  The midlands and other counties do not have that.  Communities will not accept what has been happening to date with wind farms.<\/p> <p> We have the potential to be a world leader in this area.  Let us getting moving with this and put a proper planning framework in place for the development of wind farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100032#FF00700","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506014700,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanley for bringing forward the Wind Turbine<\/p>  <p>  At the outset of this debate, it is necessary to set out the wider context of this issue.  The development of renewable energy, including wind energy, is at the centre of this Government&rsquo;s energy policy.  The availability of indigenous, sustainable power is a valuable national asset which is vital for achieving energy security and reducing fossil fuel imports, as well as for achieving challenging EU emissions reduction and renewable energy targets.  A hallmark of our energy policy approach to date has been to encourage green energy investment.  Maintaining a favourable investment climate for the renewable energy sector and sustaining regulatory stability in Ireland has been critical in facilitating the build out of renewable energy infrastructure to this point.<\/p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s heavy over-reliance on imported fossil fuels, the development of indigenous onshore wind, which in June 2017 accounted for more than 2,800 MW connected to the grid, is making a positive contribution to our energy security and avoiding approximately 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the wind sector in Ireland is subject to the planning code in the same manner as other forms of development.  Local authority development plans are required to achieve a balance in harnessing the wind energy resources of the planning authority&rsquo;s area in a manner that is consistent with national policy objectives and proper planning and sustainable development.  In this connection, planning authorities are required to have regard to my Department&rsquo;s Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006 which contain advice to assist planning authorities in drawing up their local development plans and making determinations on wind farm planning applications.  In effect, this guidance is aimed at ensuring a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification in local development plans of suitable locations for wind energy development as well as in the treatment of planning applications for such developments while also having regard to relevant national Government policy, including energy policy.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a targeted review of the 2006 guidelines has been under way since 2013.  As set out in A Programme for Partnership Government, the Government is committed to concluding the review of the guidelines as speedily as possible with a view to offering a better balance between the concerns of local communities and the need to invest in indigenous energy projects, informed by the public consultation process and best international practice.<\/p>  <p>  Since reaching agreement on A Programme for a Partnership Government in May 2016, there has been close engagement on the review of the guidelines at both ministerial and official level between my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, given its responsibility for renewable energy policy.  On foot of this engagement, in June this year the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment announced a key milestone in the review of the guidelines by announcing details of a proposed preferred draft approach to key aspects of the review which will now be subject to a strategic environmental assessment before the guidelines are finalised and adopted.  I confirm that assessment has to go to tender and the publication in respect to applications for that tender will take place tomorrow.  There will be a period of a month within which people can offer to apply to do that strategic environmental assessment project.  That is the update on that aspect that the Deputy sought.<\/p>  <p>  This preferred draft approach was outlined to provide an update to the public, industry stakeholders and planning authorities on progress being made on the review.  It sets out proposals to deal with aspects of the guidelines relating to noise, setback distance and shadow flicker, community engagement and benefit, and also policy on grid connections from wind farms to the electricity transmission and distribution system.<\/p>  <p>  On the specifics of the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill which is the subject of this debate, I would like to outline how the Government is addressing some of its key provisions.  Regarding section 2, which provides limits on the export of power generated from wind turbines, the Government&rsquo;s current policy on the export of electricity is set out in the 2012 renewable energy strategy which, in accordance with European law, supports the export of renewable energy to other EU member states.  However, it is a precondition that any such export would bring clear and significant benefit to the Irish economy at no net cost to the Irish consumer.  This policy is currently being reviewed in the context of the draft renewable electricity policy and development framework being developed by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and his Department, which will update policy on potential future energy exports.  The setting out of national policy on this matter, in Government strategies or policy frameworks, is a more appropriate approach than providing for it in primary legislation as proposed in the Deputy's Bill.  In addition, the provisions in section 2 could result in significant operational and market design implications for EirGrid, in the management of energy flows on the east-west interconnector and potentially for future interconnectors.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 relates to the location of turbines, providing that all locations for proposed wind turbines must be designated in county development plans, be consistent with the development plan and be designated with the approval of the elected members.  This is already largely the case but the key point that is missing here is that local development plans must also have regard to national policy, including energy policy, as well as section 28 guidance issued by the Minister to local authorities on the drawing up of development plans.  Section 3 is particularly problematic in that it proposes that local authorities could effectively act independently and set their own local wind energy development policy in their development plans without having regard to national policy or guidance.  This would be a retrograde step which would militate against the achievement of national policy objectives and, accordingly, the Government strongly opposes this section.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address sections 4, 5 and 6 in regard to public consultation, noise limits, shadow flicker and wind farm setback distances.  In this context, it should be noted that the recently announced preferred draft approach addresses these issues by proposing the following: the application of a more stringent noise limit, consistent with World Health Organization standards, in tandem with a new robust noise monitoring and enforcement regime to ensure compliance with noise standards; a visual amenity setback of four times the turbine height between a wind turbine and the nearest residential property, subject to a mandatory minimum distance of 500 m; the elimination of shadow flicker through requirements to operate automated wind turbine control mechanisms as a condition of the grant of planning permission; and the introduction of new obligations in regard to engagement with local communities by wind farm developers along with the provision of community benefit measures.  In this connection, a wide range of community, spatial planning, energy policy, environmental, technological and industry considerations need to be appropriately balanced.  The proposed preferred draft approach is aimed at achieving this broad balance which would not be possible under the provisions of the Deputy's Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the concerns I expressed in regard to section 3, we must also oppose the setback distance provisions in section 6 which proposes that turbines with a height of greater than 25 m shall be located not less than a distance of ten times the height of the turbine away from any dwelling.  This provision would significantly reduce the amount of land available throughout the country for wind farm development, thereby stymying the industry and minimising the possibilities for achieving our renewable energy targets while simultaneously exposing the State to substantial EU fines.<\/p>  <p>  Another aspect of the Bill to which I would like to refer to briefly is the section 11 provisions on co-ownership of wind farms for local communities.  In this regard, the Government recognises that community consultation and community dividend are important components of future wind farm development, with both community ownership and part-ownership of wind energy projects by local communities being encouraged.  Under the preferred draft approach, it is proposed to oblige developers of wind farm projects to engage in active consultation and dialogue with the local community at an early stage in the process prior to submitting a planning application.  It is further proposed that planning applications shall contain a community report prepared by the applicant outlining how the final proposal has been modified to take account of the community consultations undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the new renewable electricity support scheme, for which a consultation was launched on 4 September 2017, has community participation and ownership designed into its fabric.  The consultation sets out a number of policy options to support both community-led projects and developer-led projects with material community involvement and benefit.  In particular, the consultation is examining how to facilitate the development of community-led renewable electricity projects by providing initial funding, technical and legal advice to communities seeking to develop renewable projects.  The Deputy asked me whether we would be supporting communities.  That is the intention in that respect and that is set out in that consultation document.  Furthermore, multiple support mechanisms, including financial supports, infrastructural supports, including facilitating access to the grid for community-led projects and technical support for communities as their projects progress through to commissioning, are also being assessed.<\/p>  <p>  Larger-scale developer-led renewable electricity projects will have to meet certain criteria in terms of offering investment opportunities to local communities.  The ownership policy option is not limited to offering an equity stake, however, and the proposals put forward are aimed at maximising citizen and community participation.  The consultation also proposes a formalised community benefit payments register which will provide financial benefits to the entire community, including those unable to participate in the ownership proposals.  As each project and each community will be different, I do not believe it is appropriate to provide for co-ownership of wind farms by local communities in the quite prescriptive manner as proposed in section 11 of the Deputy's Bill and that, instead, this issue can be better addressed in the manner proposed in the preferred draft approach and in the draft renewable electricity support scheme.<\/p><p> I will respond to some of the Deputy's comments and I will come back in towards the end of the debate with other comments.  He mentioned offshore wind development.  The State is investing a great deal of money in research projects involving many stakeholders relating to the offshore possibilities of wind and other renewable energies.  Many good projects are emerging in conjunction with the research community.  Hopefully, there will be potential to develop offshore wind energy and we will achieve success.  As an island nation, we could lead on some of these projects and that is what we are trying to do.  We recognise it is more difficult in some of our waters compared to other parts of Europe to develop wind energy and that adds to the cost.  We are making significant investment in technical solutions as well and we will be successful.  In my previous role as Minister of State with responsibility for research and development, I witnessed first hand some of the work that is going in on and I am confident there will be great progress in this regard in the near future.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also mentioned other renewable energy proposals, which we very much encourage.  He referred to pig slurry and anaerobic digesters.  That is a conversation for local councillors and local communities who are not always supportive of these plans.  I agree with him that there is great potential in this regard.  Projects have been knocked for planning reasons and there have been other objections.  Sometimes their scale is too vast.  Along with others, I visited projects abroad and if they are done on the right scale, they can be favourable to communities.  That is something we can probably work on together and I would be happy to do that along with other Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100034#HH00200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506015300,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate and I thank Deputy Stanley for initiating a debate in the House on this issue.  All of us who represent rural communities will be familiar with the concerns of our constituents in many parts of the country who have had in their view a negative experience with infrastructure such as wind turbines.  While the Deputy and I share their concerns, in many ways we differ on how they should be resolved.  Support for the Bill will not bring about the kind of resolution that is required.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il opposes the Bill for a number of reasons, all of which centre on the interests of the people.  In the first instance, the provisions of the Bill would effectively stop any further developments of wind turbines in Ireland due to the extreme restrictions proposed.  Second, this Bill entirely circumvents the consultation that has been opened on the wind energy guidelines, a draft of which was published in June 2017.  My party and I are strongly of the view that this consultation gives everybody an opportunity to have their say and, ultimately and collectively, we can find an appropriate solution that meets the needs of all sides rather than rushing to a conclusion through the passage of this legislation, which would not be in the long-term best interests of our objectives in renewable energy while, at the same time, ensuring the needs and expectations of people living in rural areas who want to enjoy that amenity are also protected.  We recognise and sympathise with the considerable issues that irresponsible wind development has caused for people in recent decades, and it is crucial that we conduct a full and exhaustive consultation to protect communities from further encroachment.  To this end, we will fully engage with the consultation process that has been put in place, and ensure public consultation is to the fore of any legislation and guidelines that are put in place.<\/p>  <p>  By contrast, simply overriding existing consultative structures would deny people an opportunity to shape wind energy policy.  That is my only concern about the passage of Deputy Stanley's Bill.  It would bring to an end to the consultation process.  This process, however, can only be of immense benefit.  He is entirely well-intentioned.  I sit on the environment committee with him and I am aware of his personal desires and of his vast experience in this area but we have to ensure there is not a populist race to see who can appear to be most tune with where people are at.  I do not suggest that is the case with him.  He mentioned in his contribution that the Government proposed a set back distance four times the current distance while Fianna F&aacute;il in the past suggested six times whereas he is suggesting ten times.  We have to be careful that we are not just looking for headlines using soundbites in a manner that will meet the needs of those who are most concerned about a project in a particular area.  I am party spokesperson in this area and the Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, has reflected to me on many occasions on behalf of his constituents the concerns they have around the wind farm in Sliabh Bawn, County Roscommon, and the necessity to tackle issues that arise there.  In attempting to resolve those extreme cases-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100035#JJ00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1506015300,"counter":326,"content":"<p>They are the norm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100035#JJ00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1506015300,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Perhaps they are not extreme because there are other cases.  Decisions were taken in the past that were not in the best interests of communities but in our desire to reflect the concerns of those affected, we should not undermine the potential of onshore wind energy, which will play an important role in our climate change agenda.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Bill contains provisions which would leave Ireland open to huge legal liabilities.  For example, section 2 mandates that Ireland may not export wind energy until such time as Ireland is entirely self-sufficient in energy consumption.  This is an entirely incorrect understanding of the global energy market, and in particular, of the Integrated Single Electricity Market, I-SEM, from which Irish consumers can only benefit significantly.  Climate change poses a threat to humanity, with Ireland being no exception.  As a coastal nation with a huge economic reliance on our abundant natural resources, we are exposed to climatic shifts, such as increased storms, increased or changed precipitation patterns, droughts, and coastal erosion.  As a nation with a proud record on the international stage, we must set an example for other nations to move toward a cleaner and greener mode of living.  Wind energy, while not a fix-all, will, and should, play a role in this.  As politicians, we must do the right thing and support wind energy development, where it is appropriate and does not infringe on our people.  There is an element of a trade-off; it is not one or the other.  We must find an integrated way for wind energy projects to live in harmony with people who reside in rural areas based on the broadest and deepest level of consultation.  Mistakes were made in the past and we must be careful not to rush to judgment in a way that could be perceived as populist and driven by a soundbite suggesting that one party or grouping or one side of the House or the other has all the answers to this problem.  The best way forward is the consultative forum that has been established.  <\/p>  <p>  We are all aware of the importance of renewable energy and its global backdrop.  The EU has set 2020 renewable energy targets for each member state.  Ireland is obliged to meet the target of 16% for all energy generated from renewable sources by 2020.  This renewables target is to be met by 40% from electricity, 12% from heat and 10% from transport.  We are falling way behind on heat and transport.  With the world population projected to be more than 9 billion by 2050, the demand for remaining fossil fuels can only intensify, driving oil and gas prices skywards.<\/p><p>This, married with growing geopolitical instability, is threatening energy security.  Ireland is not fully self-sufficient and we are excessively dependent on energy imports to power homes and businesses.  It is imperative that we plot a course towards carbon-neutral self-sufficiency to meet the emerging energy supply challenges.  A lack of engagement with communities has, unfortunately, been all too common in renewable energy project development and this has caused widespread distress and inconvenienced many communities.  That was the catalyst for the Deputy in bringing forward the Bill.  Strong community support must be integral to further renewable energy project development.  Until now, community benefit schemes have primarily taken the form of amenity payments such as donations to a local GAA centre or other community related activities.  This has worked well for some communities, but there are others for which it is not an attractive option.  We must look for new and different ways for communities to benefit from local energy project development.<\/p> <p> In other jurisdictions such as Denmark a minimum number of shares must be offered on a preferential basis to the local community.  Furthermore, in Scotland community development of renewable energy projects, whereby a community sets up and owns a renewable energy project, enjoys far greater logistical and financial support.  Community developments have the added benefit of involving citizens more fully in the production of energy.  For that reason we must more broadly engage the community.<\/p> <p> We want to replace outdated wind energy project planning guidelines with new guidelines to be put on a statutory footing.  This must be done through a full public consultation process, as initiated for the draft guidelines.  As I stated, my party will engage fully with in process and bring forward its own ideas on how a community can benefit from these developments in a way that will address some of the concerns and ensure we do not eliminate the potential for the development of onshore energy projects through the wind energy sector.  We believe in the commissioning of a full economic review of wind energy, its impact on energy prices and the long-term sustainability of the sector in supplying the national grid.  We want to ensure all county development plans will involve a wind energy strategy being submitted for public consultation in advance of any wind turbine construction.  We also want to introduce a new community share options scheme for proposed wind farms whereby the local community must be given the option of purchasing a minimum of 20% of the shares, creating a sustainable wealth source for it.  We also want to introduce a new compensation provision for properties with a decreased property value as a result of the construction of wind turbines.  I will expand on this in our submission.  <\/p> <p> The party would introduce new noise and shadow flicker restrictions, reflecting international best practice, and examine the potential for increasing the number of offshore wind farms in Ireland and mapping areas where such a development could take place.  This will require support from the State.  From my discussions with those involved in the offshore wind energy sector, the greatest potential lies off the western seaboard, but there are very challenging conditions that must be addressed through support schemes.  We must consider the same support we see for the development of tidal and wave energy technologies.  In the first instance, we must support investment in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100035#JJ00400","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506015900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to have a debate on this very important matter and commend Deputy Brian Stanley for bringing forward this legislation.  The context is very important.  As the Minister of State indicated, the targeted review of the 2006 guidelines has been under way since 2013.  I was in the Department as a Minister of State when we started this work, which is an indication that we must come to a conclusion on this issue as it has been debated and batted backwards and forwards, particularly in rural communities.  The context is that we must have no doubts in bringing our carbon output down to levels we are both obliged to and want to achieve as a community.  We want to get to a point where we are carbon neutral and can address these matters.<\/p><p>There is also a context in which changing technology must be taken into account.  Onshore wind energy projects have made a great contribution.  The Minister of State spoke about the 2,800 MW connected to the grid that makes a positive contribution to our energy security and leads us to avoid 2.5 million tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions annually.  That is true and it will continue on existing wind farms and those which it will be appropriate to develop in the future.  The most exciting technological changes are offshore, as Deputy Timmy Dooley mentioned.<\/p><p>There is another context related to the consultation process for the national planning framework that has been ongoing.  It is due to come to a conclusion and the Government plans to publish the framework next month.  One of the key questions asked in the consultation document concerned the infrastructural investments required to maximise the potential of our ocean resources.  It comes under the heading of integrated land and marine development.  I agree with other speakers that the potential offshore is very encouraging.  There are cost reductions and we can look to countries such as Scotland as an example.  We need to accept that the dynamic is changing constantly and that what might have been the case in 2013 has changed as a result.  As the guidelines will be reviewed again, we must come to conclusions now.<\/p><p>I will quote from the submission I made on behalf of the Labour Party in the consultation process on the national planning framework under the heading of land and sea.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The national planning framework will need to incorporate a marine spatial strategy that defines the optimum relationship with the sea around us, including planning for coastal zones, the foreshore and its interaction with the land.  Ireland's potential to replace fossil fuels with offshore energy sources is an opportunity that simply must be exploited during the lifetime of the plan.  Technology is advancing in terms of the cost-effectiveness of wind and wave energy.  The plan must commit to the necessary research and investment in what is potentially a huge win for the environment, the economy and the coastal communities of Ireland.<\/blockquote><p>I linked the matter with the west coast, as Deputy Timmy Dooley has done, citing the example of the Wild Atlantic Way in bringing jobs and opportunities to that part of the country.  So too could offshore energy projects.  We are all supportive of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but there must be a focus on other resources.  Others have mentioned sectors such as hydro, solar, geothermal, biomass, wave, tidal and biofuels, etc., which must all contribute to a sustainable outcome for the future.<\/p><p>On balance, we have decided to support Deputy Brian Stanley's Bill.  My colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, has published a related Bill and although we do not agree on every item in this legislation, the Government might accept it, as has happened many times before.  It has accepted Bills on Second Stage and amended them on Committee Stage.  It is a reasonable and balanced approach.  There are elements about noise levels that could probably be agreed to across the Chamber and the issue of shadow flicker has been debated extensively.  There are differing views on setback distances, but relating height to setback distances is something on which everybody agrees, although there are different views on how it should be measured exactly.  There is also the matter of community gain and consultation.  The co-ownership idea put forward by Deputy Brian Stanley has been labelled as problematic by the Government, but at the same time there is broad agreement on the need for consultation with local communities, which is vital, and for the community to have a gain, a stake and a say.  Nothing will be successful, unless the community can believe it is getting something from it.  It is an important element of what Deputy Brian Stanley has proposed.<\/p><p>We will support the Bill on Second Stage, although, as I mentioned, we may not agree with every line of it.<\/p><p>The context has to be ensuring that we reach our targets and exceed them in ways I think is possible.  However, that will be dependent on more than just wind energy.  There is large potential in other areas of renewable energy.  Biomass energy has not been exploited in the way it should.  Offshore energy is particularly encouraging and solar power can also be harnessed.  I have a particular attachment to hydroelectric power because I grew up on the banks of the headrace of the Ardnacrushasa hydroelectric power station, with which Deputy Dooley is also familiar.  That was a very brave move by the Government of the time in terms of embracing the idea of alternative energy.  That was done very successfully.  At the time it was thought to be slightly off the wall but it has since proved itself.  We have certainly got plenty of water in Ireland so that is another area of potential.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party will support the Bill in principle on Second Stage.  It is disappointing that it appears the Bill will get no further.  It is a debate that must be continued and is dynamic in terms of changing costs and technology.  No Member should take a fixed position on the issue because it is constantly changing.  Guidelines are needed.  All Members have prevaricated long enough on settling on those guidelines.  In terms of the preferred draft approach, there will be a strategic environmental assessment.  I am not sure how long that will take, but the Minister of State said the tenders will be called for tomorrow.  I do not know if he can tell us how long it will take but it is an area on which there are strong feelings across the country and on which decisions have to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100036#KK00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506016500,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I commend Deputy Stanley on bringing it forward.  His views on wind turbines are somewhat different from mine.  I have listened with interest to the points made by Members and I have noted the references to the public consultation.  If there is to be public consultation, one needs to get to the nub of the issue.  Communities in parts of rural Ireland where there are wind turbines, for example, that are 100 m in height and 500 m or 600 m setback - Deputy Dooley said that a setback of 600 m is Fianna F&aacute;il policy - are experiencing serious problems.  People are not making things up.  They do not complain for the sake of complaining, nor are they against things for the sake of being against them.  Many of those people embrace different forms of energy.  There can be problems even if there is 700 m setback.  In countries where turbines are at a ratio of 10:1 there have been no problems.  It was said at Government talks that suitable areas would be limited to approximately 5% of the country.  Members and the country as a whole need to decide if we will put our people first or if we will listen to the EU ramming something at us under our so-called obligations.  We should ensure that people in those areas do not have to live a life of hell.  There are people who never objected to the establishment of wind farms but cannot now stay in their homes at night because of the noise.  The experience of people living near Sliabh B&aacute;n wind farm is an example of that.  That is the reality.  It is not made-up stuff.  Unfortunately, some elderly people had to leave their homes due to flooding.  Part of that is currently being resolved.  The three issues that Members need to decide on in regard to wind turbines are setback distance, flicker and noise.<\/p>  <p>  Members have said that we need to move away from fossil fuels.  They are entitled to their opinions.  However, they have said that we are exporting the money out of the country.  I point to the fact that most wind farms in Ireland have been bought up by foreign vulture funds and Japanese companies.  How will that money stay in Ireland?  This is a sickening thing that is happening.  I read recently that 60% of a wind farm has been bought by a Japanese company.  That money will not stay in Ireland.  Members will be aware that Bord na M&oacute;na is going to America to produce a product that the person who grows it, the person who hauls it and the boat that brings it across the Atlantic will get more out of than anyone in Ireland.  Where is the benefit in that for the Irish people?  This issue is particularly relevant to people in the west of Ireland, with the resources there.  Members need to ensure that if this is the road that is being taken, offshore wind energy is considered, as the Minister of State mentioned.  That may be a way of going forward.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be very straight with people on the proposed consultation.  I have seen many documents go out to consultation, all of which came back.  There is currently a proposal that a wind turbine cannot be closer than 500 m to a residence.  However, if it is 120 m or 130 m high and just over 500 m from housing, residents will have problems.  We can have all the consultation in the world but we must decide whether people in certain areas of the country are going to be tormented by wind turbines because the Legislature did not set a sufficient setback distance.  When wind turbines are set back 1000 m, there do not appear to be any problems.  That is the best guide by which one can go.<\/p>  <p>  In a similar way to how if one works the land, one knows the land, if one is beside or a certain distance away from a wind turbine, one knows what is and is not a problem.  That is very easy to assess throughout the country.  The big problem is that many people will go through the consultation process but thereafter one must deal with the EU and our so-called obligations.  If that means there must be a setback distance of 400 m, 500 m or 600 m, that is what Members will vote on in the House and if there is a majority, it will be passed.  Unfortunately, that would lead to problems for people in certain areas.  There has already been a court case in Ireland in relation to flicker from a wind turbine.  People should not have to live a life of hell.  They were there before the turbine was there.  They might have worked the land for possibly the past 100 years and now because of turbines in the area, it has gone up.  There are certain parts of this country in which there would be no problem achieving a 10:1 radius.  I do not understand why the Government does not focus on that and ensure that, on one side, there is adherence to whatever agreements are made and, on the other, that rural communities can live in peace.<\/p>  <p>  There are huge opportunities in renewable energy.  I spoke to a person in Kildare in recent days who discussed biogas and the potential of silage.  That may be of help to a farmer if the beef barons think they will keep him or her at bay with the price of cattle.  If it works out and is efficient, that will be welcome.  Members have discussed exporting electricity and so on.  Based on what England has done, Ireland is not exporting very much power.  An interconnector to bring power in from France has been proposed.<\/p><p>The public service obligation, PSO, levy has risen again this year for the ordinary people to subsidise something.  Peat was subsidised but I do not agree with that.  Every year the price is raised by the back door because we are dealing with things that cannot stand on their own and are not viable, for the sake of legislation to which we have signed up.  Electricity will have to become much dearer to make viable some of the systems that are in place.  We will then lose out on the manufacturing side because we will not be able to compete with countries such as Germany.  There are some companies in the west of Ireland who were at the National Ploughing Championships yesterday which have had incredible success.  We do not need to put barriers in their way.<\/p> <p> Not every area is affected by this but everyone in the country is important no matter where they live, north, south, east or west.  If one goes around the country there is no need to have a consultation period because it is there to be seen, problems of between 400 m and 800 m.  If one is a kilometre away there is no problem with the 10:1 ratio if it is 100 m high.  It is achievable if we want to go down that road.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider and support this Bill.  Everyone can have their say on Committee Stage.  We need to put people first and end the nightmare some people are having in certain parts of the country because something has been foisted upon them.  <\/p> <p> The Minister of State spoke about the councils but they have no say.  He said if they are not in compliance with the Department's guidelines they cannot make a decision.  Their hands are tied.  It is up to the main parties and the rest of the D&aacute;il to decide the distance back and I hope they go with Deputy Stanley's proposal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100037#LL00200","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506017100,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan that this is an area where things keep changing.  It is full of uncertainties.  I commend Deputy Stanley on his Bill and I understand that his motives are right and while there are many elements of it that I support, I cannot support the Bill.  I will explain in detail the reason.<\/p>  <p>  The one thing that is fixed is the physical atmosphere we operate in and the absolute certainty around climate science that it presents a real threat to all our people and we must respond to it.  In my reading of the Paris climate agreement and all the analysis of the scientific recommendations, if a country such as Ireland is to take this seriously we have to have a 100% decarbonised energy system in the next three decades or so.  I would even go more quickly but we are aiming for 2050.  That is what we signed up to.  It is not spelt out that this is Ireland's obligation.  It is not coming from the EU but from an agreement we were party to and rightly so.  Is there an understanding that we have agreed to do this?  It is an incredible goal to try to achieve, to remove fossil fuels from transport, heating and power generation.  That is what we have to do.  The scale of the transformation is huge.<\/p>  <p>  I would set us on course to do it both because it is the right thing to do for the future of our people and because it sets us up for a new economy from which this country will benefit.  A brilliant Irishwoman, Marie Donnelly, who is head of the European Commission's renewables section, spoke recently here in the Oireachtas audiovisual centre.  She made the simple point of asking why would Ireland, the country that missed out on the first industrial revolution, look to miss out on this new industrial revolution.  That is what it is.  Renewables are winning.  It is game over.  They are winning in China and in America, no matter what Donald Trump says.  They are now the mainstay of new electricity generation.  In Europe last year I think approximately 85% of all new power generation was renewable.  The same is true of electric vehicles and the development of efficiency technologies.  That is where all the economic development and opportunities are going.  For us to opt out would be to miss an incredible economic opportunity.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not believe we can do oil, coal or gas.  There is no working technology for storage of carbon.  Some of the modelling from UCC and others, Irish energy associations and so on talk about storing carbon but there is no working or economic model for that.  We have to stop burning fossil fuels quickly.  I heard Deputy Stanley say that Bord na M&oacute;na had launched its \"naturally driven\" campaign at the National Ploughing Championships a couple of days ago.  Nothing Bord na M&oacute;na is doing at present deserves to be called \"naturally driven\".  It cannot go out and buy up hardwood wild natural forests in Georgia, slash them, bring the wood over here and call it \"naturally\" anything.  It is a completely unsustainable model.  I have changed my view on that.  Ten years ago I might have thought maybe we could do something with biomass but we found out that the land use issue in that regard means we cannot do that.  We cannot go out and hold our head up high by chopping down other countries' forests and shipping them over here.  Two thirds of the energy goes as waste heat up a chimney.  That is not a viable solution.  Bord na M&oacute;na is looking for the Government to invest some of the national strategic investment fund in it.  If the Government invests in that I am sorry to say our credentials would be shot.  They are already in sufficient difficulty internationally.  We cannot go down that route.  <\/p>  <p>  I would love to see us take up ocean energy but that is a 20:1 bet and a 20:1 time horizon at best.  There is no working wave device, even among the best tidal power companies in the world.  We do not have a big tidal resource.  I would love to think, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan does, that hydro energy is available to us but we have used up most of the big resources there.  Even with hydro energy there are environmental problems.  That is not somewhere we can turn.  <\/p>  <p>  We can turn to a mixture of wind and solar development, particularly offshore wind, and interconnection.  This new electricity system will work by an incredible complex balancing system, which the EU is getting ready to legislate for at the moment.  This will be done on a regional basis, not just us with the United Kingdom, but with the UK and France and Denmark and Belgium and Norway in a north-west European grid which balances the variable supply and demand.  Interconnection is key.  We cannot cut ourselves off as an island and think we could be energy efficient.  Deputy Stanley should note that were we to do that, it would make us incredibly expensive because there has to be an expensive back-up system.  The better, cheaper back-up system is for us to connect with our neighbours and be part of this new evolving system.  That is the primary reason why I cannot support the Bill.  Section 2 states we must be energy self-sufficient first but that is not the clever way to go.  We have enough difficulties without the North-South interconnector and cutting ourselves off from the North and the problem with Brexit.  We cannot think we can double down on that and cut ourselves off.  I have considered this in real detail and it is not the correct economic approach.  That is my main concern in respect of this Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Deputies who reflected concerns outside here and we do have to be absolutely attentive to the concerns of communities in regard to the development of wind power.  There are many complicated questions around that.  We have learnt in recent years that small scale wind turbines do not work.  We thought some years ago that micro turbines would work but there is no evidence for that yet.  Maybe somebody will develop new technology for them but they are not economic.  Do we want a large number of small turbines or a small number of large ones?  <\/p><p>Where we should go next is a massive offshore campaign.  What has happened to offshore wind in the past two or three years is dramatic.  Three years ago the price of offshore wind would have been around 15 cent per kW\/h.  Because of a new bidding system adopted by the Dutch, the Danes and even the British, the price of offshore wind this year is down to 60 cent per kW\/h.  It is cheaper than any other potential supply.  Some people suggest nuclear energy but that is two or three times that price and we do not want these massive power stations.  We need to move towards flexible, variable supplies.  We should go towards offshore wind and massively towards solar energy, particularly solar panels on roofs so that we get it in the ownership of people, not necessarily of the big corporations.  We have to make a conscious significant switch towards it being owned locally and I agree with those who spoke earlier about that.  The Government should be proactive in that.<\/p> <p> On using semi-State companies, during the Green Party's time in government we had a massive programme of expansion of Bord Gais as well as ESB, Coilte and Bord na M&oacute;na into renewables.  Some outside said we should not have four State companies doing it.  To my mind, the more the better and the more State ownership the better.  I regret that policy was stopped when Bord Gais energy assets were sold off.  We could return to that.<\/p> <p> We need to go to energy co-operatives not only in the 20% provision, which I welcome although one could look at a higher figure of 30%, but we ought actively to support energy co-operatives that are supply companies as well as generation companies, such as Ecopower in the Flemish part of Belgium, which is doing a balancing act between variable supply and variable demand.  There could be co-operatives where people who live close to power stations would get their electricity at very cheap prices to run electric vehicles, so one would run one's car off the local turbine and get cheap prices for the heat pump system that we can use to electrify our heating systems.  We should have the sort of emphasis which the Tipperary Energy Agency has in supporting not only the generation of ownership but also the retrofitting of houses, the electrification of transport and heat, the consumer being involved in owning part of the generation but also benefitting from all the new sophisticated energy supply and demand management mechanisms, which we should look at so they are the best they can be.<\/p> <p> Yes, we need to stop flicker.  That can be done by stopping the turbines when the sun is at a certain height.  We need to be conscious of noise issues and setback issues.  If we are not going to do that with wind and solar interconnection, how are we going to power our country in a way that is carbon neutral, that is responsible and sees us at the forefront of the industrial revolution taking place rather than holding back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100038#MM00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506017700,"counter":335,"content":"<p>To echo some remarks made earlier, we have had 16 of the 17 warmest years on record since 2000 and we routinely break records on drought, rainfall and so on.

In recent days, Ervia, the mother company which looks after Irish Water and the distribution of gas, released a report which indicated that Ireland's gas reserves are very healthy and have probably never been healthier.  The Minister whose remit covers the environment and climate change seems to think that it is okay to issue exploration licences for what is potentially the extraction of a huge amount of gas and oil from the Porcupine Basin in coming years when all the advice from scientists across the globe is that it should be left in the earth.  We have huge reserves of carbon and fossil fuel.  Our problem is the more of it we burn, the more we threaten the environment and the planet.  Like others in this House, I take great interest in renewable energy and the role which solar and wind energy can play.  I find it difficult to understand why we are failing to unveil or roll out projects that would be popular in this country to deliver carbon neutral energy.<\/p><p>I agree with other speakers that this would be a no-brainer and a win-win for Ireland's industrial prospects.  Let us compare ourselves with Germany, for example.  In Germany the minimum distance allowed for a wind turbine from any home is twice what we allow, at 1,000 m.  In other countries across Europe, particularly in northern Europe, there has been huge investment in offshore wind turbines.  The distances they allow for are considerably beyond what we allow for here from the shore, for the shore's protection.  They allow for 22 km or 12 nautical miles from the shore.  We do not allow anything near that.<\/p><p>One explanation for why there is always such opposition to windmills and wind power in this country is not that the people of the midlands or north Meath are so parochial and NIMBYist that they do not want to see renewables, but they are worried about their regulation and how they are introduced.  There is no democratic debate with local communities and no buy-in for local communities because most, if not all, of these projects are owned, run and have vested interests invested in them by global corporations.  The reliance on the market means that these companies will profit hugely from wind turbines.  Local people are not thick.  They recognise that and so there is no buy-in for their lives being hugely discommoded and their environment affected.<\/p><p>I want to see the regulations proposed in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill being discussed and examined seriously by the Government as they have the potential to offset concerns among local people.  The investment in offshore wind must be looked at in a serious way.  That means massive State investment to end our dependence on fossil fuels.  It also means employing high standards in how we do this or else we will meet with increasing opposition from people.  We must recognise that it should not be all about generating profit for multinationals.  There must be a greater role for the local population in developing an alternative to fossil fuel.<\/p><p>We support this Bill for wind energy and understand the importance of providing energy for this country.  Deputy Ryan said he disagrees with section 2 of the Bill which states:<\/p><blockquote>the Minister shall, in determining whether such product is excess product, have regard to whether the product generated from wind turbines and other forms of renewable resources is of an amount that is greater than the amount of energy needed for the island of Ireland to be deemed self-sufficient in the generation and consumption of electrical power...<\/blockquote><p>However, it is possible to amend this Bill to ensure that the energy generated is shared with our neighbours and the wider EU.<\/p><p>We support this Bill and more generally we will adopt more guidelines that work in other countries.  We do so supporting the idea of massive investment in renewables, led by communities and supported by the State and not left to the vagaries of the market and those who seek to maximise their profits but with the interests of the environment and the future of the planet and its people at its heart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100039#NN00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1506018300,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I thank Deputy Stanley for tabling it.  It is great to have an opportunity to discuss renewable energy in the D&aacute;il in the first week since we returned from our summer recess.  While the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is opposed to certain elements of the Bill, it has some very positive elements.  It is regrettable that once again it is left to the Opposition parties to raise one of the major issues facing our people and this country.  The reason there is such anxiety, worry and fear in communities about renewable energy, in particular wind energy, is due to the manner in which the Government and the previous Government handled the debate.<\/p>  <p>  A year into the previous D&aacute;il term, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the then Government and the UK Government which would have enabled large-scale industrial wind farms to be erected in the midlands, with all the energy being exported to the UK.  There was no local buy-in or local consultation.  At the time, the then Government wanted to power ahead with this proposal, so much so the people in the midlands were only saved from the industrial wind farm by virtue of the fact the UK Government pulled out of the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  For more than six years, since Pat Rabbitte was the Minister, we have listened to Ministers stating the publication of new wind energy guidelines would be done without much further delay and that they were only a matter of months away.  Those months have turned into years.  Despite the fact the previous Government carried out a wide-ranging consultation process, nothing has happened since.<\/p>  <p>  In the previous Government, the Ministers, Deputy Kelly and Alex White, could not come to terms or agree on the best way forward.  In this Government there also appears to be a difference of opinion between Ministers on the best way forward.  This is something that needs to be addressed.  My party published its own wind energy guidelines more than four years ago, and it is regrettable the Government has not progressed this further at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Only today, I met a representative of the motor industry who spoke about the need to try to encourage people away from the use of diesel cars to hybrid cars.  In the case of one particular brand, 4% of new passenger vehicles sold in 2015 were hybrid.  In 2016, this had increased to 12% of passenger vehicles sold, and if we look thus far in 2017, 28% of all new passenger vehicles sold are hybrid.  The general population realises fossil fuels are not never-ending and we need to look to a new way of ensuring we have sustainable energy to power our homes, businesses and cars.  However, the Government is not responding.<\/p>  <p>  A number of years ago, I went with my party leader to Denmark, which is possibly a world leader in how it has embraced renewable energy, particularly in how it has embraced wind energy.  It took its lead in the 1970s when there was an oil crisis.  At that stage it stated it would not be dependent on a resource over which it had no control.  It started to diversify away from fossil fuels to wind energy.  Now, more than 30% of its overall energy is from wind.  A large proportion of this is wind on land.  In latter years it has moved to offshore wind energy.  As someone who was very much a vocal opponent of wind energy a number of years ago, I visited a number of wind farms, and they can work in the right locations.  With the advance of technology, we can address the issues of noise and shadow flicker and the concerns of the people.  However, the only way they can be addressed is to consult people, listen to their concerns and show them where international best practice works.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there are people in our country who will say they want wind turbines but not in their own location.  This is a fact.  There are also people who will use and exploit people's fears for their own political gain.  This is a fact.  As national politicians and legislators who want to ensure we can make a lasting difference on the future, we need to ensure people are informed of the facts and that we have proper legislation and proper guidelines in place to ensure people's lives are not severely and negatively impacted.  The Government has failed to do this.<\/p>  <p>  There is plenty in the Bill that is very positive but there are elements of the Bill about which we have concerns.  One of these elements is that the Bill states all locations for proposed wind turbines must be designated in county development plans and be consistent with the plan.  This is all very well in certain parts of a county.  I do not know what part of Laois Deputy Stanley lives in, but where I live in Westmeath is two miles from the Longford border.  There are people who live much closer to various county borders.  A plan adopted in one county might not necessarily be the same plan adopted in the county beside it.  It might be at total variance to that of the county beside it.  A person living near a county border might be more adversely affected by the plan adopted in the county across the border than the plan of the person's own county.  It is important we have a national policy on this.  Each county should not work in a silo or in isolation.  We need a national policy, which is why I urge the Government to be upfront and straight, tell the people what it is doing and listen to the suggestions that have been made.<\/p>  <p>  Something that made a huge difference to engaging with officials in Denmark, where we visited a number of years ago, was that people had local buy-in.  The reason they had local buy-in was they had a tangible benefit from the renewable energy.  I am not speaking about a multinational company coming in and giving &euro;10,000 to sponsor sports jerseys.  While this would be very welcome by a local GAA club and it would do good work in the community, what was done in Denmark was a co-operative style system was put in place and the local people benefited from cheaper electricity.  This is not what was proposed originally by the previous Government, which was to export the energy across the water, with no tangible benefits for the people who would have to see the turbines being erected on their land.<\/p>  <p>  We need to set a required distance from any residence.<\/p><p>We need strict noise controls and to restrict shadow flicker but I believe wind farms have a role play in the right locations, including inland.  More important, we should be considering the role of offshore wind energy generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100040#OO00100","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506018900,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss further this important issue.  I acknowledge the contributions of Deputies on the Bill, as proposed by Deputy Stanley.  This issue generates much interest and debate among all relevant stakeholders, interest groups and the wider community.  It is certainly worthy of discussion here.  That is why we are to have consultation over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley is correct that it will take about six months to go through the whole process.  The initial phase will involve the strategic environmental assessment, SES.  That will start tomorrow.  We will get it moving then.  The process is now under way.  It is important that we have it and that we discuss the draft guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  While I note the merits of some provisions of the Bill, as mentioned, the Government has already committed to addressing most of the issues raised in the Bill as part of the ongoing review of the 2006 wind energy guidelines.  We believe this is the appropriate approach.  I recognise the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill was produced in good faith but that is our view.  Statutory planning guidelines are the most appropriate way to deal with these issues rather than primary legislation, as proposed.  In this regard, ministerial planning guidelines issued under section 28 of the planning Act provide sufficient flexibility in the application of the advisory nature of the guidelines at local level while also ensuring consistency of approach, having regard to relevant national Government policy, particularly energy policy.  In the proposed revisions of the guidelines, as contained in a preferred draft approach published in June of this year, the Government aims to strike an appropriate balance between addressing the concerns of local communities regarding wind farms, with which concerns I am very familiar as I represent areas that are greatly affected and in respect of which I have had ongoing discussions, and the need to invest in indigenous renewable energy projects for the purpose of enhancing our economic and environmental sustainability while also assisting in the achievement of our EU climate and energy targets.  People want to achieve the targets because they represent the right thing to do.  Deputy Eamon Ryan addressed this.  Irish people believe in this but it is a question of how we manage and balance our energy development and do what is right in the right places.  That is what the guidelines will attempt to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  A particular focus of the preferred draft approach is to underpin the principle of early and active engagement by developers of wind farms with local communities, combined with the provision of community benefit measures in locations where wind farms are proposed.  Even when I was a counsellor, I always encouraged engagement with the community from day one with regard to any proposal or development.  One should get the balance right, obtain support and try to bring the community with one when one can.  It is possible in most cases because most people are reasonable.  There are fears, however, so there is a duty to do all that can be done to allay those fears.<\/p>  <p>  The development of projects is carried out quite well in other countries.  We have done it well ourselves in many cases but it is a question of enhancement and streamlining our approach to ensure communities gain and do not suffer.  That is the most important part.<\/p>  <p>  The preferred draft approach also proposes stringent noise controls consistent with WHO standards, the establishment of a robust noise-monitoring regime for wind farms, the elimination of shadow flicker through inbuilt automated control mechanisms on wind farms, and the introduction of revised setback distances from residential dwellings to protect visual amenity.  These are all possible because of technology changes.  What people would have called for years ago is now possible.  There is no reason to be having this debate on shadow flicker.  We can deal with it and put it to bed.  That is what we should do.<\/p>  <p>  All these proposals will be subject to a strategic environmental assessment, as required by EU legislation, including a public consultation process, before they are finalised.  That process will be kicked off tomorrow.  I hope we will be at the implementation stage in November after the tenders are dealt with in the month of October.  All the provisions in the Deputy's Bill are being addressed as part of other policy initiatives, such as the renewable electricity policy and development framework, being developed by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, and his Department.  It will incorporate policy in line with EU requirements in regard to potential future energy exports, thereby setting updated national policy in this regard.  Also to be considered is the renewable electricity supply scheme, RESS, which is to be finalised in the coming months.  It is aimed at fostering and strengthening concepts of community participation and ownership in renewable electricity projects while further supporting the community benefit concept, as proposed in a preferred draft approach.<\/p>  <p>  There is a further aspect of Deputy Stanley&rsquo;s Bill that I would like to address but which I omitted in my intervention earlier this evening.  It relates to section 7, pertaining to transitional provisions that would require existing wind turbines already operating and well established in local communities to comply with the ten-times turbine height setback distance proposals in section 6 within a 12-month period after the enactment of the Bill.  These provisions would entail existing wind turbines either having to be reduced in height in their current locations or moved to other locations in order to comply with the setback requirement.  The proposal in the Bill in regard to existing wind turbines is not feasible from either a legal or practical perspective.  I acknowledge the Deputy's intentions but there are State obligations to be adhered to.  We must be careful that we manage these.<\/p>  <p>  As I have outlined, many of the provisions of the Bill have already been addressed in the context of the ongoing review of the 2006 guidelines and in policy initiatives being progressed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and its Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten.  I accept that this has dragged on for a long number of years.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to her time in my Department.  This has been going on too long.  The agreement reached in June of this year with the two Departments and two Ministers on the preferred approach is a welcome step and an important milestone.  Tomorrow will comprise a part of that, in addition to what will occur in the months ahead.  It is time to end this conversation, make decisions and offer people some certainty with regard to plans and proposals.  It is important that we do so.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the review of the guidelines and the other Government policy initiatives mentioned will collectively provide for a clearer, balanced and more robust system of appropriate controls for wind energy development.  Accordingly, I wish to confirm that the Government is opposed the Bill at this stage because of the proposals we are involved with.  I hope that is understood by most people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100041#PP00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1506018900,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I listened carefully to the replies.

We disagree with it and believe we should go a bit further.  It is not a populist position.  I explained earlier the amount of land available with even a 2 km setback distance, based on research from National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  It is substantial.

I circulated our position five years ago throughout our party, and we try to get a joined-up approach at local level.<\/p> <p> I welcome the proposals from Fianna F&aacute;il.  We believe it should go further.  We have produced research to show that there is sufficient land with a 1 km or 1.25 km setback in order to provide substantial wind farm developments.<\/p> <p> We are not saying our Bill is 100% perfect.  This is Second Stage of legislation into which we put a lot of effort, research and work, and it was legally proofed.  We are not pretending we have all the answers and I would never be so arrogant as to say that.  We spoke to environmental groups and people working in the industry, and we believe it is a good starting point.  The House should allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage where amendments can be put forward.  This is our opening shot, and I say that in a very constructive way.  <\/p> <p> I welcome that the Minister of State said the tendering process for the SEA is commencing tomorrow.  That is good news.  I do not know what triggered that for tomorrow.  Perhaps it is a coincidence, given that we are debating this Bill today.  I welcome it.  We need to move on.  Deputy O'Sullivan, who is a former Minister, said we started the process in 2013.  I remember it.  Commissioner Phil Hogan was here at the time.  We are in 2017, with only a few months left to 2018, so let us move on.  Wind farm developers are building in the meantime.<\/p> <p> The Green Party put forward a case against the Bill, and I accept it is genuine in what it believes.  It left out many other sources of energy, such as anaerobic digestion and hydropower.  I know hydropower has its limitations.  Deputy Ryan did not mention other sources of energy.  We agree that, based on our information from the industry, offshore energy is getting cheaper and we should drive on that process with gusto. <\/p> <p> We on this planet have not as yet sussed out a way of storing wind, which is a major problem.  The greatest demand for energy is during periods such as the big freeze we had a number of years ago.  There was significant demand on the grid, but there was no way of storing wind energy.  The nights and days were calm and there was no wind, but there was heavy frost.<\/p> <p> Many parties, including those in government, have referred to ownership.  The Minister of State said it should be encouraged.  We are saying that it can be offered, or it could be mandatory.  If people wanted to take it up, they could do so.  There is a fair amount of agreement on this area.  <\/p> <p> We had a discussion on setback distances.  The Minister of State said research is being done on offshore energy, which needs to be accelerated.  There is chaos in the wind farm industry, and we need to bring some order to it.  The Bill proposes to put in place a planning and regulatory system to make sure we have orderly development and do not make the same mistakes as we have in other industries.  We cannot just plough ahead.<\/p> <p> I refer to the SEA process.  It is good that tenders are proceeding.  <\/p> <p> The 4 km setback provision is not adequate, and I say that sincerely.  We have shown that a lot of land is available.  Our proposal is for 10 km and Fianna F&aacute;il proposed a 6 km limit.  We need to have a discussion.<\/p> <p> Deputy Troy mentioned the community dividend.  It is not good enough to allow major wind farm developers to sponsor a set of charities or local clubs.  That is tokenism and is simply buying off communities.  It is not real community participation.  I referred to Templederry, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.  I am sure he will agree it is a shining example of community buy-in and ownership.  We want real community participation.<\/p> <p> I refer to climate action and what happened in Inishowen.  I was in the area during a weekend and returned on Monday.  On Tuesday morning, the heavens opened.  I have been told that there has never been such serious flooding on the Inishowen peninsula.  We have seen the damage done along the Shannon, something with which Deputy Dooley will be familiar given that he lives in a county which is on the banks of the Shannon, County Clare.  There was significant flooding in the area.  The same happened in County Roscommon, which is Deputy Fitzmaurice's county.  There have been significant problems in my area of Laois-Offaly.<\/p> <p> We have to deal with climate change.  We have international obligations which Sinn F&eacute;in takes very seriously.  I plead with the Minister of State and Government to move on in terms of developing renewable sources of energy.  I mentioned anaerobic digestion.  It would be an opportunity to solve a problem in the agricultural sector and create jobs and wealth.  It would reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p> <p> We all need to understand that the future will involve multiple sources of electricity supply.  Wind, with a big bang, is not going to do it.  We can no longer rely on oil, something other countries have copped on to, and we have to bring into play very quickly a suite of options, including solar energy.  It is an area on which we are very slow to pick up.  We must move ahead with solar power and connect panels to the grid.  We must start putting them on top of new schools and large cattle sheds which are being built.  Some cattle sheds cover an acre with south facing sloped roofs.  All of them should have solar panels.  Let us move ahead and agree on that point. <\/p> <p> I hope the Minister of State will have a change of heart and let the Bill go to Committee Stage where we can have a debate and discuss amendments to improve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100041#PP01200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1506019500,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1506019500,"counter":351,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 28 September 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092100042#QQ00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1506019500,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 7.40 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 26 September 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
