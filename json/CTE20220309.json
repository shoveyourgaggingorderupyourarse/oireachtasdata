The committee will hear from several experts, officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and representatives from Teagasc.<\/p> <p>  On 28 February, the legal requirement for mask wearing in all settings was removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use a face mask cover, in particular in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear a face mask when moving around the campus or in close proximity to others.  While the easing of restrictions has removed the general requirement of maintaining a 2 m physical distance, the public health advice continues to state that maintaining a distance from other people is good practice.  It is important that everyone in the parliamentary community continues to respect the physical space of other people.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that a witness has full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.

There can be no insurance in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.<\/p><p> During the first session today members will hear from several experts on CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.  Dr. Thomas McLoughlin has worked as a research scientist with leading biotechnology companies and in universities in Ireland and the United States of America in the areas of soil microbiology and molecular genetics for 20 years.  Dr. McLoughlin later worked as a senior scientist for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and is now retired, on the implementation of GMO regulations of Ireland.<\/p><p> Dr. Barbara Doyle Prestwich is head of plant science and principal investigator at University College Cork, UCC, and her research area includes plant science, biotechnology, sustainable agriculture and genetics.

I wish to thank the committee for the kind invitation to come before it this evening.  In particular, I wish to thank Senator Paul Daly for getting this important subject on the agenda.<\/p> <p>  Gene or genome editing is also referred to as new genomic techniques and new breeding techniques.  I will use the acronym GE.<\/p> <p>  The world faces enormous challenges in producing sustainable food for its growing population, given the escalating pressures of climate change and biodiversity loss.  There can be no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic reminded us of our vulnerability and the need to be prepared for potential future pandemics.  The same can be said of how we produce our food and the potential for food shortages due to drought, floods, forest fires, the advent of more aggressive plant and animal diseases or pests, and the threat due to war.<\/p> <p>  The EU&rsquo;s farm to fork strategy is the cornerstone of its green deal.  Its objective is to contribute to a more sustainable food production system by reducing, among other things, dependency on pesticides by 50%.  The strategy refers to GE, which may play a role in increasing sustainability.<\/p> <p>  I shall turn now to mutation breeding.  Over the past 70 years, mutations in plant genomes have been induced by plant breeders using ionizing radiation or chemicals to increase genetic variability.  This method of modifying genetic material is called random mutagenesis and the resulting organisms are technically genetically modified organisms, GMOs, and are exempt from the scope of EU GMO legislation on the basis that they have a long history of safe use.  Much of the food we eat today originated from the use of this technology. <\/p> <p>  What is gene editing?  GE, which can be defined as all techniques to alter the genome of an organism developed after 2001 - when the EU's legislation on GMOs was adopted - has rapidly developed over the last two decades in many parts of the world, with some applications already on the market.  The most recent addition to the breeder&rsquo;s toolbox, discovered in 2012, is a GE technique called CRISPR-Cas9, which is what we are talking about this evening.  It is described as a genetic scissors that can be used by scientists to change the DNA of animals, plants, and microbes with extremely high precision.  Two scientists, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the 2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry for discovering this technique.<\/p> <p>  In 2018 the European Union Court of Justice, ECJ, ruled that organisms obtained by induced or classical random mutagenesis constitute GMOs, and that these are exempt under the GMO directive.  However, the ruling also stated that organisms obtained through techniques of directed mutagenesis involving techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 are not excluded from the scope of the directive.  Since that ruling, there has been much debate about its implications.  Industry, breeders, farmers and academia were alarmed at the court&rsquo;s decision.<\/p> <p>  The ruling prompted many European plant and life science companies to submit a paper to the EU Commission outlining the negative consequences for agriculture if all organisms developed with GE will have to comply with EU rules on GMOs.  This prompted the EU Council in November 2019 to request the Commission to submit a study in light of the ECJ ruling regarding the status of GE techniques under Union law.<\/p> <p>  Contributing towards this process, 12 legal and scientific experts - including myself - published an article in January 2021.  In this article we analysed the court&rsquo;s judgment and concluded that the ruling merely sheds light on the court&rsquo;s general thinking but did not address the legal status of organisms developed through GE techniques in general, nor was it asked to do this.  Also, the precise implications of the ECJ ruling are far from settled, as is also highlighted by the Council&rsquo;s request to the Commission.  Furthermore, in November 2021, the French authorities took a second case to the ECJ seeking further clarity on the 2018 judgment.<\/p> <p>  The EU study was published in April 2021, following stakeholder consultations.  The main findings were that GE technology has the potential to contribute to sustainable food systems; and that the 2001 GMO legislation is not fit for purpose and needs updating.  It is more than 20 years old and the science has moved on but the legislation has not moved on.  Concerns were also raised over potential impacts on biodiversity, coexistence and labelling.  The European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, concluded that targeted mutagenesis techniques that modify the DNA of plants, like some CRISPR technologies, do not pose more hazards than conventional breeding or techniques of GMO.  The executive summary states that organisms obtained through GE are subject to the GMO legislation.  In a submission to the Commission in May 2021, a number of EU regulatory experts, including myself, concluded that this statement was not substantiated by the report and we urged the Commission to elaborate on the points raised in our analysis in order to reduce the ambiguity in the regulatory status of organisms obtained with GE.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the next steps, the EU Commission is working on a targeted policy action on crop plants derived from targeted mutagenesis.  This policy aims at a proportionate regulatory oversight to maintain a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment, and to achieve the goals of the farm to fork strategy, which is of paramount importance.  An impact assessment, including a public consultation, will be carried out by the Commission to examine potential policy options this year and a proposal for legislation by the middle of 2023.<\/p> <p>  We can ask whether EU attitudes are changing on GE.  There is certainly an increasing interest in GE technology worldwide.  This was driven by the part played by modern biotechnology in the identification of the vaccines, PCR and antigen tests, and genomic sequencing that are enabling the world to protect us against the Covid pandemic.  These are all examples of advances in modern biotechnology over the past 40 years.  I put it to the Chairman that these are of paramount importance.  Science is taking us out of this terrible pandemic. <\/p> <p>  Will GE technology be used in the EU?  GE technology has the propensity to revolutionise agriculture, environment and medicine for the benefit of people worldwide.  It is of paramount importance that this technology is regulated in a proportionate manner at EU level and harmonised with other countries.  We hope that the intransigence regarding GMO adoption in the EU for the past 30 years does not continue to blight the adoption of GE technologies like CRISPR into the future.  This message needs to be communicated by the Irish Government at EU level.

It cannot be business as usual in terms of crop food production.  The most recent IPCC report paints a damning picture of our collective inaction in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  Ireland is currently ranked first in the world in terms of global food security in the Global Food Security Index, but the index is dynamic and we cannot afford to become complacent.  Unexpected external shocks can have a huge impact on a nation&rsquo;s food security as evidenced by the ongoing situation in eastern Europe.  In addition, under the European green deal and to meet the United Nations sustainable development goals, we in Ireland must make changes in how we produce and manage our crops.<\/p> <p>  My colleague Dr. Raghuram Badmi will focus more closely on the actual technology.  For my part, I will focus on the international scene and why I believe we cannot afford to ignore CRISPR technology in Ireland, and more broadly across the European Union.<\/p><p>The constraints we face in terms of sustainable food production include, but are not limited to, land use, water availability, drought, heatwaves, flooding, disease control and soil health, coupled with an ever-diminishing list of available agri-chemicals.  Some might argue that Ireland is not quite at the coalface in terms of impacts of climate change on food production, but it would be a grave mistake to ignore the writing on the wall.  At present, we have a toolkit that includes new genomic techniques, also known as new breeding techniques, NBTs, which Dr. McLoughlin referred to and which are continually being rolled out in many countries around the world.  These techniques offer precision genetic engineering capabilities that can introduce discrete changes in a plant&rsquo;s DNA in order to make improvements such as disease resistance and drought tolerance, as well as many others.<br\/><br\/>What is the international experience of this technology, including CRISPR?  As Dr. McLoughlin pointed out, this is a relatively new technology, but already we are seeing its adoption in many countries to great effect.  Argentina has been a leader in the regulation of these NBTs since 2015.  Data gathered there offers us some insight into the potential of this technology and its impact, not just on crop production but on technological innovation and its democratisation.  What I mean by democratisation is that SMEs and the public sector have an opportunity to participate in product development and commercialisation.  According to Whelan in 2020, &quot;As a source of codified knowledge, regulations have a direct impact on technology diffusion because they affect the generation of new technologies, as well as decisions on their adoption by potential users&quot;.  This is very important for both Ireland and the EU.<br\/><br\/>Over the past 30 years, one of the main criticisms levelled at the plant biotech industry globally has been that the production of biotech crops is in the hands of approximately four multinationals, leading to issues connected with food sovereignty.  To a large degree this has been due to the huge cost and time involved in the regulatory and commercialisation process, with no guarantee of subsequent product approval.  Due to delays caused by over-regulation, some biotech industries have left Europe - BASF in 2012 is a case in point.  Compare this with the development of crops via NBTs over the past three years.  I have included a table in my report, Table 1, taken from Eriksson in 2018, where already we are seeing a diverse range of traits being produced.  Some have been produced from within the public sector.  One can see in the table crops such as soybean, maize, mushrooms and potatoes and the traits vary from drought and salt tolerance to oil content, anti-browning and so forth.  Among the players in that table are places such as the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in the United States and Pennsylvania State University, among others.<br\/><br\/>Safety and regulation must be top of any country&rsquo;s list when it comes to the introduction of new technologies.  A regulatory process needs to be effective and efficient, and enabling of technological innovation, which should be a major consideration of policy makers.  Again, if we look to Argentina, its regulations do not include a list of named techniques <i>per se<\/i>.  As a consequence, they can be agile and are able to respond quickly to small incremental steps in technological innovation.  This has led to more innovation.  At least seven countries, so far, exempt genome edited products from genetically modified organisms, GMO, regulation where there is no additional DNA incorporated into the plant.  Those countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Japan and the USA.<br\/><br\/>What are the challenges for Ireland?  The European Commission&rsquo;s farm to fork strategy is recognised as a cornerstone of the European green deal.  This green deal has committed to no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, a decoupling of economic growth from resource use and no person or country being left behind.  However, in realising these ambitions, Ireland will face some serious challenges in terms of crop food production.  Under the farm to fork strategy, there is an ambition to halve chemical pesticide use by 2030 under the sustainable use of pesticides directive.  However, what are the alternatives on offer with this diminishing use of agri-chemicals?  I refer to the technological toolkit, the NBTs that I mentioned earlier, which we cannot afford to ignore.  In fact, last month the recently elected chair of the EU Parliament&rsquo;s agriculture committee, Norbert Lins, called for progress on NBTs.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, we in Ireland and Europe cannot afford to ignore the technological advances that CRISPR has to offer in terms of addressing our commitments under the European green deal, specifically climate, biodiversity and food systems.  We must also be cognisant of how different national regulatory standards will impact international trade.  The EU imports over 32.5 million tons of soybean and soybean meal from South and North America and approximately 5 million tons of rapeseed and rapeseed oil from Ukraine, Canada and Australia.  I am not mentioning wheat in that figure.  Finally, it was originally thought that the EU Court of Justice ruling that limited access to this technology would also have a large impact on Africa.  However, it is now accepted that China, whose five- year plan prioritises new breeding techniques, could fill the gap if the EU fails to engage with the technology.  For consumers, food producers and European economies, this would be a grave mistake.  I thank the members for listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barbara Doyle Prestwich","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I wish to convey my sincere thanks for this opportunity to share my views on the CRISPR-Cas9 or, more generally, genome editing technologies.  Genome editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats - CRISPR associated protein 9, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, TALENS, and zinc finger nucleases, ZFNs, are all, in their basic forms, a pair of specific DNA scissors.  They are specific for a particular DNA code, meaning that they can only recognize one specific stretch of a DNA sequence.  If these scissors encounter a DNA sequence that does not match with their own DNA binding code, they cannot bind or cut that sequence.<\/p> <p>  These scissors scan the DNA, recognize and bind to their specific DNA sequence and perform the cut.  Once there is a cut in the DNA, the cellular repair machinery recognizes the cut and initiates the repair process.  Any cut in the DNA is a signal to the cell for recruiting the repairing tools at that site and completing the repair process.  When the cell decides to repair the DNA, it mostly chooses a repair mechanism called non-homologous end joining, NHEJ.  During the NHEJ repair process, a different DNA base - A, T, G or C - is added to the DNA 30% to 70% of the time, thereby changing the DNA code.  The part of the DNA with the changed code loses its function and the plants that have these different bases are selected.  This is how the editing of the genome or genome editing is achieved.  This type of editing comes under the site-directed nuclease type-1, SDN-1, technology where it does not require an outside DNA and occurs as a result of an error-prone DNA repair mechanism of the cell.  This method would be the first-choice for any researcher because the only aim here is to break the DNA at the desired location, then the cell takes over for the rest of the process.  One example of SDN-1 is soybean oil with no trans-fat, with high oleic oil and low linolenic oil content developed by Calyxt using TALENS.  This is the first commercially-available gene-edited plant product in 2019.  The second example is camelina, the plant in the mustard family used for oil with enhanced omega-3 oil.  It was developed by using CRISPR by Yield10 Bioscience and cleared by the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, in 2017.<\/p> <p>  However, sometimes only breaking the DNA is not enough.  When there is a need to improve the function of a certain gene, a stretch of DNA which is functional, it might require adding, deleting or changing specific DNA bases at a particular DNA location.  To do such precise editing, a repair DNA template is introduced, along with the scissors - DNA scissors plus repair DNA template.  The repair DNA template has the correct bases that we want to add or delete and the DNA address for where it should go and stick to.  When we do this, the cell chooses a different repair mechanism called homology directed repair, HDR, about 5% to 10% of the time at best.  During HDR, the cell copies the DNA bases present in the repair DNA.  The copied DNA segment replaces the original DNA segment and completes the repair process.<\/p> <p>  A modified version of CRISPR-Cas9 known as base editing is emerging.  Base editing, as the name suggests, is used to convert the specific base in the DNA from A to G or from C to T, without the need for a repair DNA template.  These types of editing come under the category of site-directed nuclease type-2, SDN-2, technology that includes making small but precise edits to the DNA in the order of a few bases, which in most cases are sufficient to improve functions of the gene.  Examples of base editing are high nitrogen use efficiency in rice by changing one base cytosine, C, to thymine, T, using cytidine base editor, and high yield in rice by changing adenine, A, to guanine, G, using adenine base editor and simultaneously C to T at specific places of SPL genes.<\/p><p>Site-directed nuclease type-3 technology involves inserting entire genes or DNA fragments, which can comprise more than 1,000 base pairs.  SDN-3 is used to provide novel functionalities to the plants that are not present before.  An example of SDN-3 is golden rice, a variety of rice engineered to produce beta-carotene, pro-vitamin A, to help combat vitamin A deficiency.<\/p><p> SDN-1 and SDN-2 both mimic natural mutations caused by chemicals or irradiation.  However, unlike other mutations that occur randomly in the entire genome of an organism, SDN-1 and SDN-2 are very precise, which is almost everything we could ask for.<\/p><p> On the next sheet of my written opening statement I have some additional information for all the members to go through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Raghuram Badmi","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  As mentioned in the Chairman's prefatory comments, my interest in gene editing is for medical purposes.<br\/><br\/>Sixty-five years ago scientists discovered that a single specific mutation in the sequence of our DNA was enough to cause the genetic disorder sickle cell anaemia.  The same is true of cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy and 4,000 other inherited disorders.  Collectively, these diseases affect 7% of the world's population.  It is not rare to have a rare disease but it is extremely rare to have an effective treatment.<br\/><br\/>In 1970 the concept of gene therapy was proposed.  The idea was to add a corrected copy of the defective DNA sequence into cells of an affected individual.  In 1993 the technology finally caught up with the idea and the first clinical trials began.  However, three decades and 5,000 clinical trails later, with remarkable advances, we still have only two gene therapies that have been licensed.  Peter Marks of the Food and Drug Administration recently stated that it would take 600 years to increase that number to 100 approved medicines if we were to continue with existing tools at the current rate.<br\/><br\/>Rather than paper over the cracks in the genome, can we delve into the genome, find those mutations and fix or edit them?  Yes, but I ask the committee to consider for a moment the magnitude of the problem.  The book I am holding up contains about a million letters or bits of information; our genome contains 3 billion bits of information, or 3,000 of these books stacked on top of one another.  That is the height of the Spire of Dublin, which, by coincidence, is overlaid with the double helix pattern of DNA.  However, the mutation we need to fix is just one letter in those 3,000 volumes, and all that information is in the DNA of a cell that cannot be seen without a microscope, so it is quite a challenge.<br\/><br\/>In 2005 scientists in California described one of the techniques already mentioned, with the first precision gene-editing technique to correct a mutation in cells from a patient with severe combined immune deficiency.  The symptoms of that disease are as bad as its name suggests.  A few years later my lab in Cork became the first to use that technique to correct the most common cystic fibrosis mutation in cells.  However, progress with these early editing techniques was slow and we really needed a paradigm shift.<br\/><br\/>The breakthrough, as mentioned, came in 2012 with CRISPR-Cas9, a programmable RNA-guided DNA endonuclease.  It was the missing piece of the puzzle.  CRISPR-Cas9 could target any mutation in any gene in any organism.  For academic labs it was free and easy to use.  Within a year a new CRISPR study was being published every day.  Currently, a new CRISPR study is published every 60 minutes.  These research publications are describing proof-of-treatment studies for hundreds of rare diseases in animal models and in human cells.  The first ethically approved clinical trial of CRISPR reported its results in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine<\/i>, the most prestigious medical journal in the world, for a handful of patients with a rare liver disease just last summer.  There are many more clinical trials ongoing as we speak, and more sophisticated and refined CRISPR strategies are constantly emerging with improved specificity and safety.  We require additional tools to target specific tissues in patients, and those will need to be underpinned by appropriate medical, regulatory and access frameworks to pay for them.  However, for individuals with these diseases - cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, certain types of cancer and thousands of other conditions - there is now real hope and real prospects because of CRISPR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Harrison"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their comprehensive and extremely interesting opening statements.

The kernel of the issue I see, from reading the witnesses' opening statements and from their presentations, is that, based on the European Court of Justice ruling, the GMO directive, in the witnesses' opinion, should not include CRISPR-Cas9 because, in layman's terms, as I read it, GMO technology involves bringing in outside DNA or combining two unrelated organisms, whether plant, animal or whatever else, whereas with CRISPR there is no outside influence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#D00400","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>There could be.  CRISPR could be used such that there would not be a need to introduce any foreign DNA, but the CRISPR technique could also be used such that a gene from another organism is inserted.  It depends on what is used.  Dr. Badmi mentioned SDN-1 and SDN-2.  They are deregulated, if you like, in other jurisdictions.  They are CRISPR techniques that, in our view, should not be regulated as GMO.  A number of other countries in the world, such as the United States, Argentina and now the UK, can see this technology as hugely important rather than bulking everything together in the GMO regulations.  As for the definition of GMO, our argument against the ECJ decision was that it has to involve something that occurs naturally.  Mutations occur naturally in plants and micro-organisms.  They are not included in the GMO regulations.  The ECJ has bulked them all in together.  The 12 people who wrote that article, including me, and other people since have argued that that decision was probably not the right one.  Even the Council of the European Union was not happy with it either.  We might have another chance with the French going back and asking for more clarity.

As a case in point, if we look back to Teagasc and the GM potato, which I am sure we will hear more about, that DNA that came from a wild variety of potato made it blight tolerant.  That was done using GM technology and the same could have been done using plant breeding.  What was done in Teagasc and Wageningen University was to speed up the process.  Senator Paul Daly mentioned the resistance to ash dieback as well.  The power of this technology can be used to speed up the plant breeding process.<\/p> <p>  As for safety, EU studies have concluded it is no different, and I imagine the same will be said about gene editing.  As Dr. Badmi said, some of the gene editing techniques happen in nature, and that is why we cannot differentiate between some CRISPR techniques and what happens in nature.  There is no technique to evaluate that change.  In the case of many of the GM products on the market at the moment, such as in Spain, there has been a reduction in the use of pesticides.  That must be good for both climate and biodiversity, two very important issues.  Of course, the European Green Deal seeks to reduce the use of plant-protection products but, as Dr. Doyle Prestwich asked, if we reduce their use and get rid of them, how will Irish potato farmers farm their potatoes without the use of some of these techniques?  This is why we are arguing that CRISPR-Cas9 could take the place of some of the chemicals we use to control potato blight in Ireland.  We have to be very careful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Thomas McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>One of the main arguments traditionally made against GMO relates to corporate influences, as Dr. Doyle Prestwich mentioned in her opening remarks.

How can that be mitigated?  Will our guests describe how they would foresee circumstances playing out?  Dr. McLoughlin gave the example of potato growers in Ireland.  How would they operate if we were using this system?  Would they annually have to get seeds from a particular company and be bound by contract to that company?  How would that relationship evolve over time and how would farmers be protected?

One of the reasons I mentioned democratisation relates to the fact that the biggest difference with CRISPR technology in the context of regulation relates to the fact that what happened, say, 30 years ago will not happen again.  We are seeing this already within the public sector and among SMEs.  If we correctly regulate this and do not classify it under a GMO, we can democratise the process.  People such as us in academic labs around Ireland will have greater access, and access to commercialisation will be a more level playing field.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, more than 30 years ago, two of the main traits in genetically modified crops were insect resistance and herbicide tolerance.  In the few years in which CRISPR has been used in this way, however, we are seeing a much more diverse range of traits that will suit smaller holdings as well.  I refer to resistance to drought, for example, or, in the context of health, the issue of increased oil the Deputy mentioned and so on.  Certainly, in terms of democratisation, there will be significant changes if CRISPR is regulated in the right way such that we do not push towards the large multinationals.  As I said, it has been well documented that the regulation of crops is very expensive.  Applying to get a product onto the market can cost up to &euro;20 million.  As universities, we cannot afford this, and neither can SMEs, which are being pushed out of the market in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barbara Doyle Prestwich"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I might return to an earlier question.  It struck me when Dr. Doyle Prestwich and Dr. Badmi were talking that there is a massive parallel to gene editing in humans.  We knew how to edit mammalian cells in the 1980s but we could not do it for therapeutic purposes because a marker had to be added.  The breakthrough in 2005, which I mentioned earlier, was that cells could be edited with CRISPR without adding that marker.  This is something Dr. Doyle Prestwich and Dr. Badmi touched on.  With CRISPR, there is a choice.  Editing can be done without the marker, which is what they are arguing should go forward, or with a marker, which I think they are arguing against.  If that distinction is made, we cannot hide the fact that certain things can be done with CRISPR that people may not want, but there is much that can be done with CRISPR that people could be quite happy with and that could have many benefits for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Harrison"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for attending.  I do not think four doctors have ever appeared together before an Oireachtas agriculture committee.  That does not mean we are daunted by them; we are an incorrigible bunch.  There has been much bad publicity about this issue in the past.  There is no Green Party member of the committee in attendance at the moment, although perhaps he is attending remotely.  Nevertheless, there are fears of a loss of control in regard to production, issues with seed production and scaremongering in regard to whether there will be plants that do not have valid or high-quality seeds.  Another member mentioned Monsanto and there has been much international publicity about that company.  This is very powerful technology.  There was a reference earlier to how similar technology has been used in the context of human healthcare and it does not seem to present the same problem.<\/p> <p>  Will our guests elaborate on the issue of sustainable agriculture and the European Green Deal?  How does this all fit in to the bigger picture and architecture of the European Green Deal?  It is a very current issue that everyone is buying into.  It is part of the CAP discussions and wider environmental issues.  This country has a coalition Government including the Green Party, which has expressed strong views on the issue.  Even so, when I ran a quick search within the programme for Government in advance of this meeting, I found no reference to the issue.  It does not seem to be a commitment for the Government one way or the other.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, stated that Government would keep it under active consideration but there were no commitments.  Clearly, there have been advances and it is a developing technology, but there genuine concerns and, in the absence of facts, people are somewhat frightened by it all.<\/p> <p>  How do our guests foresee the European Green Deal fitting in with all this aspiration, vision and planning?  It is very important.  In Ireland, responsibility for GMO policy and regulation comes under the Departments of the Environment, Communications and Climate Action, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health, the EPA and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Do our guests have views on that?  Should it be more centralised?  I appreciate there is overlap and I can see why, but they might outline their views.   In the interests of reassuring people, how can all this be squared up?

The technology is more than 30 years old and has been used worldwide, especially in North America and South America.  Most of the soybean that we import is GM and the corn is GM.  In fact, a good argument for the GM potato is whether consumers in Ireland would eat a potato that was not sprayed ten or 13 times during the year?  The other question I have is that organic farmers in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union are allowed to use copper sulphate to control potato blight fungus.  Copper sulphate is actually a heavy metal from copper.  It is crazy that such products are on the market.  To have consumers using a GM potato has to be much safer but, as Dr. Doyle Prestwich said, communicating that message to the public is hugely important.<\/p> <p>  One of the Deputies asked whether there were any concerns over the years.  The big concern 30 years ago with herbicidal tolerant plants was that those plants would become invasive within the environment.  That did not happen.  However, we have a lot of invasive species in the west of Ireland.  In my own part, Achill Island, there is gunnera.  There are rhododendron and Japanese knotweed all over the country and no one is doing anything about it.  They are not even on the list at the EU because they are out of control, yet we are worried about something that probably will never happen with a GM crop, let alone CRISPR.  I think the CRISPR technology is much safer again and, as I have stated, is the same as traditional plant breeding and GM technology.  Communicating it to the public is very important.

For farmers in Ireland, I honestly do not understand how we can efficiently and effectively reduce our pesticides by half by 2030, which is the commitment.  We may well reduce our pesticides but the disease is still out there, so what do we do to treat the disease?  Dr. McLoughlin referred to copper sulphate in the organic sector, which is banned in a conventional setting, but what do farmers conventionally use?  What is available to them?<\/p> <p>  Again, coming back to communication, this is something we have suffered from within this industry for a very long time because other groups will get out ahead of the scientists and say certain things.  Those are real concerns that we have to take on board as well but, sometimes, the truth gets lost in the story.  A quick sound bite gets out there and it is run and all the rest, so the real science gets lost.  We definitely have a battle in terms of the communication.<\/p> <p>  This could be one of our solutions, although I do not think any of us would say that this is the only way forward.  As stated earlier, and we all alluded to it, what we are talking about is a toolkit.  From that toolkit, there are certain things we can take, and this is just one of them.  For example, we have the integrated pest management strategy.  This does not take from maintaining good soil health, crop rotation or good agricultural practice, but what it does is give every farmer in the country the possibility to reduce their spraying regimes and, as a consequence, reduce emissions as they do not have to spray with fossil fuel-based chemicals.

I have read that but is it correct?  On top of that, on the European green deal, unfortunately, they probably did not listen to the most important people in all of this, the farmers.

I am principal officer of the environment policy division in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Susan Fleming, assistant principal officer.  In my role as principal officer, I lead the division with responsibility for environmental policy matters, including in relation to the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, into the environment, the transboundary movement of GMOs and the contained use of GMOs.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the competent authority in this area.  Responsibility for regulating seed for cultivation and animal feed in relation to GMOs falls under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Department of Health has responsibility for policy matters concerning food safety with respect to genetically modified food.<\/p> <p>  A GMO is any organism whose genetic material has been modified using genetic engineering or transgenic technology, for example, by insertion of genetic material from another living organism or through gene editing.  This modification confers certain traits that are considered advantageous, such as increased productivity for crops or resistance to disease.  No genetically modified crops are commercially cultivated anywhere on the island of Ireland and the only GMOs approved for cultivation in the EU are not suitable or relevant to Irish agricultural conditions.  International policy on GMOs is governed by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.  The protocol is an international treaty governing the movements of GMOs from one country to another.  The treaty is an agreement under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which is the main international instrument for addressing biodiversity issues.  The protocol recognises that modern biotechnology and the cultivation of GMOs presents the potential to enhance human well-being while also recognising the need to protect human health and the environment from the potentially harmful impacts of GMOs.  The protocol also sets out how risk assessment and risk management procedures should be conducted, to assess and control any potential risks arising from the importation of GMOs.  All EU member states and the Union itself are parties to this protocol.<\/p> <p>  To implement the provisions of the protocol, the EU has put in place a comprehensive legal framework to deal with all aspects of the cultivation, transportation, labelling and use of GMOs, including the assessment and authorisation of genetically modified crops for cultivation; the assessment and authorisation of genetically modified products for use in food and animal feed; the cultivation of authorised genetically modified crops alongside conventional and organic crops; and the transboundary movement of genetically modified crops.  The main aim of this legislation is to protect the environment from potential harm arising from the cultivation of genetically modified crops or other genetically modified organisms, as well as giving the consumer a clear choice, through labelling, between genetically modified and non-genetically modified products, and the confidence that all genetically modified products can be traced back to source.<\/p> <p>  Given the multifaceted nature of GMOs, an inter-agency meeting is held yearly between relevant bodies to support inter-agency working and policy positions while a statutory EPA advisory committee on GMOs is in place, providing advice to the EPA board on GMO matters.  This committee has a broad remit and may be consulted on any aspects of its functions in relation to GMOs which the EPA considers appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I return to the Department's two main policy areas.  The deliberate release of a GMO means any intentional introduction into the environment of a GMO or a combination of GMOs for which no specific containment measures are used.  Deliberate release includes the placing on the market of genetically modified products or cultivation of genetically modified crops, including, for example, field trials in the case of genetically modified plants or any experimental release into the environment and clinical trials involving human medicinal products containing or consisting of GMOs.  Deliberate release is governed by Directive 2001\/18\/EC at EU level and regulated at national level through SI 500 of 2003 - Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 2003.  The EPA is the competent authority.<\/p> <p>  Contained use refers to the use of GMOs or genetically modified micro-organisms in a controlled setting and for which specific containment measures are used in order to limit their contact with, and provide a high level of safety for, the general population and the environment.  As well as being physical, barriers can be chemical and-or biological.  In Ireland, the contained use of GMOs is predominantly carried out in laboratories in colleges, universities and hospitals and by industry, for example, by biopharmaceutical companies.  Contained use is governed by Directive 2009\/41\/EC at EU level and regulated at national level through SI 73 of 2001 - Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2001, as amended.  The EPA is the competent authority.<\/p> <p>  On this evening&rsquo;s discussions on CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.  It differs from traditional genetic modification methods as CRISPR is able to resequence an organism's DNA without the insertion of DNA from another organism.  This technique, in the main, does not involve the transfer of genes or DNA from another variety or species but alters the existing DNA sequence of the organism.  These new mutagenesis techniques are referred to as new genomic techniques, NGTs.<\/p><p>In July 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that organisms obtained using NGTs are GMOs and are subject to the full rigour of GMO legislation.  In the EU this is likely to slow the development of GM crops produced using these techniques and make research using CRISPR more costly to undertake.<\/p><p> In particular, for member states, difficulties arise with the identification and quantification of the products produced using these techniques making enforcement more difficult.  Many of these new mutagenesis techniques have been developed since the introduction of the GMO legislation.<\/p><p> The EU will need to address this matter through inter alia revising EU GMO legislation.  The 2018 ruling prevents the EU from benefiting from the technological advances and competitiveness available to societies elsewhere, for example in the USA, China, Canada and in post-Brexit UK.  This ruling has been also criticised by industry and a number of breeding companies are considering relocating their advanced mutagenesis breeding programs outside the EU.<\/p><p> Subsequent to the European Court of Justice ruling, a number of member states expressed a desire to amend EU legislation to facilitate the registration of NGTs for possible cultivation and use in the EU.  As a result, the EU commissioned a study on the regulation of NGTs, which was published on 29 April 2021.  There were a number of expert contributors to the study and some of the main conclusions included the following.<\/p><p> Many NGT products have been developed over the past 20 years with some already on the market in third countries and many more expected in the coming years.  Regulation at trade level is problematic as detection and differentiation of NGT products that do not contain foreign genetic material is extremely difficult.  A different regulatory regime for NGTs in the EU versus third countries will lead to disruption in trade between member states and their trading partners, potentially leading to trade disputes.  The current regulatory regime in the EU, where NGTs are regulated in the same way as GMOs, restricts research and development and has a particularly negative impact on research and development work emanating from research institutions and SMEs.<\/p><p> The study concludes that NGTs can contribute to the objectives of the European Union Green Deal and the farm-to-fork strategy by developing plants more resistant to diseases, improved tolerances to environmental stress due to climate change, improved agronomic and nutritional traits, reduced toxins and allergens and reduced use of inputs such as fertiliser and plant protection products.  In the pharmaceutical sector, NGTs would afford faster development of medicinal products, including vaccines, which could address unmet medical needs.<\/p><p> Negative aspects are identified, such as concerns regarding potential safety, potential negative impact on biodiversity, concerns regarding cross-contamination when cultivated beside conventional and organic crops, as well as regulation of labelling and consumers' right to information and freedom of choice.  Stakeholders have different and often opposing views on these aspects.<\/p><p> The European Food Safety Authority concluded that plant products derived by conventional breeding techniques, which are not currently classed as GMOs and which target mutagenesis and cisgenesis, can have similar risk profiles.  Thus, a different regulatory oversight for products with similar levels of risk would not be justified.  The current risk-assessment procedures are rigid and not open to adaptation to evolving scientific progress, as will inevitably occur with further development of NGTs.  The study indicates that the risk-assessment procedure employed for traditional GMOs is not fit for purpose for NGTs and their products and it needs adaptation to scientific and technological progress.  Any new legislation needs to be resilient, future proof and uniformly applied, as well as contribute to sustainability objectives.<\/p><p> Following the publication of the study in April last year, the European Commission proposes to develop a policy action on NGTs which will facilitate a proportionate regulatory oversight, while at the same time maintaining a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment and, allow the Community to reap the benefits from innovation.<\/p><p> Inception impact assessments aim to inform citizens and stakeholders about the Commission's plans in order to allow it to provide feedback on an intended initiative and to participate effectively in future consultation activities.  In this regard, the Commission published an inception impact assessment on a proposal on the introduction of legislation for plants produced by certain new genomic techniques in September 2021 and received more than 70,000 responses.<\/p><p> The Commission is currently carrying out an impact assessment, including a public consultation, to examine potential policy options and a wide-ranging communication effort to share the results of the study and to discuss its outcome and next steps with the EU institutions and stakeholders.  The impact assessment will also ensure policy consistency with other initiatives, for example food sustainability.  It is expected that the legislative proposal will be available for public consultation in the second quarter of 2022 with a final adoption in 2023 and aims to tackle the issues I have highlighted.<\/p><p> GMO crops are not commercially cultivated anywhere on the island of Ireland.  In addition, there was a Government decision in 2018 to transpose Directive 2015\/412, which has been completed and enables Ireland to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs, and to change Ireland's voting stance from abstention to voting against the cultivation of GMOs.  This currently sets the direction of GMO cultivation policy in Ireland.  However, it is important that the GMO area be kept under review as it is ever evolving and has potentially wide-reaching socioeconomic and environmental implications.  The legislative proposal which is due from the European committee in the second quarter of this year will be carefully examined by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other relevant Departments, Government agencies and stakeholders once published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Deegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I now call Dr. O'Mara.

I have two colleagues to assist me this evening Dr. Ewen Mullins and Mr. John Spink.<\/p> <p>  The process of breeding high-performance varieties is dependent on the ability to generate and exploit genetic diversity within breeding populations.  The more diverse the population the greater the chance of identifying a highly valued trait for farmers, processors and consumers.  For over 70 years mutagenesis has been an established method of generating that diversity.<\/p> <p>  By treating seeds or plants with radiation or chemical mutagens, mutagenesis changes the function of thousands of genes in a plant.  Consequently, this changes how the plant performs.  By evaluating tens of thousands of plants over several years, new varieties with enhanced performance or quality can be identified.<\/p> <p>  A key problem with mutagenesis is that the process is purely random and induces thousands of other unwanted genetic changes in the variety, which are not required.  In contrast, gene editing is a precision breeding technique which makes it possible to enhance the performance of an organism via a targeted approach that changes a single gene at a time.<\/p> <p>  This is achieved using a molecular technique termed CRISPR-Cas, which is composed of two parts, a \"molecular scissors\" used to cut the DNA an, a molecular \"satnav\" to guide the scissors to the specific gene.  Together these two parts form the CRISPR-Cas machinery that can be used to modify a single gene or indeed if necessary, tens of genes at the same time.<\/p> <p>  What does this mean in practical terms?  Looking to crop breeding for example, editing now allows breeders to deliver a range of traits such as yield enhancement, disease resistance or quality improvement.  An important point to make is that editing an existing variety enhances the value of that variety for the farmer or the processor, without changing any of the other traits of the original variety.<\/p> <p>  For example, many existing potato varieties meet the requirements for processing and baking but lack durable resistance to late blight disease.  Because of this susceptibility to late blight, the potato crop requires approximately 12 fungicide sprays per year.  Editing provides breeders with the toolbox to make precise changes to the potato DNA and increase resistance to late blight and other potato diseases, without compromising any of the important qualities of the variety.<\/p> <p>  Another recently reported example describes how editing a single gene in wheat, the MLO gene, can deliver a wheat variety with resistance to mildew.  In its natural state, this gene makes wheat susceptible to mildew, which can decrease yield potential.  By editing the MLO gene, the researchers turned off the MLO gene and hence enhanced the existing variety giving it resistance to an important disease, without affecting the variety&rsquo;s yield potential.  This is simply not possible using conventional breeding techniques, such as mutagenesis, when every step in the breeding process will alter thousands of genes at a time.<\/p> <p>  This highlights the precision of the editing technique.  Compared with humans, who have approximately 24,000 genes, there are more than 300,000 genes in wheat.  Having the ability to precisely disrupt a single gene among 300,000 is groundbreaking and illustrates the power of editing as a breeding tool.<\/p> <p>  As members know, in 2019 the European Commission published the Green Deal.<\/p><p>As part of that, the farm-to-fork strategy aims for a 50% reduction in the use of chemical inputs and a 20% decrease in nutrient inputs on cropping systems.  As it takes on average ten years to develop a new cereal variety and up to 13 years for a potato variety, if we are to meet farm-to-fork goals, all available innovations, technologies and tools must be considered.<\/p><p> The potential of new breeding techniques is real.  For example, I point to the field experiment carried out at Oak Park from 2013 to 2015 as part of an EU-funded project led by Dr. Mullins.  That work assessed the impact of a blight-resistant potato variety generated using a new breeding technique.  With this novel potato variety, fungicide applications were reduced from 12 sprays to two sprays per season, hence maintaining the sustainability of the crop and demonstrating how farm-to-fork ambitions can be achieved.<\/p><p> An important remit of Teagasc is to investigate the potential impact of novel technologies on the performance and sustainability of the agrifood sector.  Editing is but one application of technology that has the potential to assist in the breeding of novel crop varieties and animal breeds.  Currently we are using several genomics-based techniques within conventional breeding programmes to improve productivity and underpin farmer returns.  One of these is marker-assisted selection, which is much like the economic breeding index, EBI, in cattle.  However, although these can improve the rate of genetic improvement, it is still a slow process.<\/p><p>A judgment of the European Court of Justice in 2018 ruled that organisms generated through editing must be regarded as genetically modified organisms, GMOs, within the meaning of EU Directive 2001\/18.  At a practical level, this means a novel crop variety developed through editing is technically defined as a GMO and hence must pass through the regulatory system within the EU prior to its commercialisation.  As has been well documented, this process is both lengthy and extremely expensive.  However, since the European Court of Justice ruling in 2018, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that editing techniques do not pose any more hazards than conventional breeding.  A multitude of scientific organisations across the EU have arrived at a similar conclusion.<\/p><p> To conclude, Teagasc is not in the business of commercialising or promoting genetically modified crops.  We are responsible for supporting the profitability and environmental sustainability of the sector.  To achieve this, it is incumbent on us to investigate and assess the impact of new scientific developments, be they positive or negative, so that the relevant sectors and society as a whole can make a decision based on objective information specific to Ireland.<\/p><p> We are happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frank O'Mara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Teagasc is the national research body for the agrifood industry.

Professor O'Mara has been unequivocal in stating his belief that this technology is a route that needs to be pursued.  I am not sure if he had the opportunity to hear the earlier presentations.  I asked previous witnesses about some of the concerns around GMO.  It is not the case that some EU commissioners woke up one morning and decided that GMO technology would be banned.  The ban came about because there was huge public demand for it, in line with the precautionary approach.  I have mentioned some of the concerns that have been raised with us previously, including the potential effect and impact on biodiversity, on associated or neighbouring crops and on the wider environment, as has already been mentioned.  Other concerns centre on the ownership of the technology and the seeds associated with it.  Has Teagasc carried out any research into those concerns and is it satisfied that they can be addressed, as our previous guests indicated, through a regulatory approach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#N00800","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I will ask Dr. Mullins to come in on the detail of that in a moment but in relation to the contribution it could make, we have very challenging targets in the farm-to-fork strategy which reflect the very challenging objectives of society.

To do all that, we need every tool that we can get.  We need to find ways to bring innovation and advances to the food production system and these new genetic technologies are one extra tool to enhance our ability to close the circle.  It is not that they are the be-all and end-all but they certainly could be a help to us.  As I outlined in our opening statement, work that we did some years ago, on which Dr Mullins will expand, demonstrated that really clearly, where we were able to grow a potato crop with a lot less pesticides, resulting in a lot less of an impact on the environment.  The farm-to-fork strategy calls for less pesticide use because of the potential impact of pesticides on the environment and if we have a technology that can allow us to do that safely, then that is a good thing.

We have looked at the impact on biodiversity and co-existence, or the issue of pollen-spread across the landscape.  In terms of biodiversity, in our potato study we took a gene from a wild potato which gives a conventional potato resistance to late blight.  The overwhelming majority of our potato varieties are very susceptible to late blight so by giving them that resistance gene, we effectively gave the crop immunity.  We used a new breeding technique which was not editing but a different type of technique which still comes under the umbrella of new breeding techniques.  Over the three years of the EU study, we grew the potato in the field in Oak Park and looked at the biodiversity impact below ground on soil microbes and also on insects above the ground.  There was no difference between the conventional variety sitting 6 m away in other plots versus what we were seeing with this new-bred variety of potato.

The control which had no resistance required ten sprays to maintain the crop.  It really depends on the environment, including weather, humidity and the various factors for late blight that we know.  We used an integrated pest management approach that included modelling the weather.  Our default position was that we would not spray unless we absolutely had to.  At the moment, that is not necessarily the practice because farmers must protect their crop from late blight.  We reduced the sprays from ten down to two but those two sprays were purely precautionary.  What we could see is that in another year we might have one spray or three sprays but we are getting the spraying down below the 50% target, which is what is needed for farm to fork.<\/p> <p>  The key issue, as I said, is that there was no impact on biodiversity relative to what we would see with a normal potato crop.  That is exciting at one level because, as I said, it is a proof of concept.  However, the key point is that it takes a long time to breed new varieties.  We are talking a decade or up to 13 years for a potato variety.  We know that because we have been breeding them in Teagasc for over 50 years now.  With the new breeding techniques, we are accelerating that breeding process.  We are effectively halving the amount of time it takes to get a new variety.  It ticks all of those boxes.  We could still cross a wild potato with a conventional potato to get resistance but when we do that, we are mixing all of the genes from the wild potato with all of the genes from the conventional one and we get a lot of traits that we do not want.  It takes many years to dilute out that background of genetic material that is there.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of co-existence or the pollen spread, we looked at ways to minimise that.  There are very practical ways to minimise pollen spread within a crop.  We looked at oilseed rape, which produces a lot of pollen that can travel for up to 150 m from the crop.  That tails away very quickly away from the crop, which is not surprising.  Measures such as isolation distances, keeping the crop in the centre of the farm and farmers working together in a co-operative environment all help.  With the latter, farmers communicate with each other and provide information on when they are growing material and where.  All of these very practical measures can ensure effective co-existence.  The important point about co-existence is that it is preserving the identity of the crop that is being grown but for organic growers it is extremely important that they can grow their crop on their farm and know there is no risk of the organic thresholds being exceeded.  That is very important for certification of organic systems.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carthy also asked about seed ownership.  Basically, in North America, Canada, and Argentina, farmers go to the seed co-op and they sign an agreement that if they purchase genetically modified seed and grow it, they are prohibited from saving it.  Farmers do not have to grow it if they do not want to in that scenario.  When they go back to the co-op each year, as is the case in Ireland, they want to purchase the best seed.<\/p><p>As is the case with farmers in Ireland when purchasing seed, they want to purchase the best seed.  Putting the best seed in the ground lays the foundation for a good crop.  That is typically the approach taken in North America, Canada, etc.  There are ownership rights when someone purchases a genetically modified seed, obviously outside Europe as GM crops are not grown in Europe.  That is well documented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#N01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ewen Mullins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank both groups for attending.

One measures the progeny of a bull and identifies which is the best bull and breeds from that bull.  That is conventional breeding.  We have used genomics or genomic selection in cattle breeding in recent years.  We have used the DNA profile of the animals as a additional way of identifying, and doing so at an early stage, which of them might be the best but we are not using any technique to alter the DNA of the animal.  In conventional plant breeding we do all the same things.  We are talking about a technique that could improve that process of getting better genes in an organism.  We are talking mainly about plants.  The same could happen with animals.  The CRISPR-Cas system could be used in animals.

I would like to be associated with the good wishes to Dr. O'Mara.<\/p> <p>  Speaking hypothetically, if CRISPR was allowed, do the witnesses think it would enhance the role of Teagasc?  In other words, is Teagasc being held back by virtue of the fact that it cannot use CRISPR?  In talking about CRISPR, we are all talking about non-transgenic and the modification of the indigenous DNA of the specific plants or products we are discussing.  This is trans-European but as we are Irish we will worry about the green jersey.  How far behind the curve are we and are we in a position where we can turn up?  In terms of Teagasc's research, has it ever provided feedback to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine specifically to the effect that it is being hamstrung by virtue of the fact that there is need for a change in Europe?  Teagasc's Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, MACC, was adopted.  The witnesses will often say that they only do the research and we formulate the policy, but the Teagasc research carried out in that regard has almost become policy.  Does Teagasc have any leverage in terms of being able to say to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in particular that it is hamstrung and that it will never be able to keep up?  Food security is in danger if we do not get a change in European law or the European directive such that we can start using the CRISPR-cas9.  Is it ever the case that at meetings within the organisation there are people asking for the use of this to be allowed and saying that there is so much they could do with it?  Is it holding Teagasc back?<\/p> <p>  Before Teagasc responds, I have a question for the Department.  What seems to come across from the Department is the enforcement of the directive almost with blinkers on.  The message that came across is that the Department is trying to ensure no environmental damage through the cultivation of GMO or whatever.<\/p><p>When looking at that, does the Department ever do a balance sheet and look at the negatives of not having GMOs?  As part of the European green deal, there is a goal to reduce the use of chemicals.  When the potential environmental damage of cultivation is being analysed, is the other side of the balance sheet taken into consideration?  If reducing the use of chemicals by 50% were to negate environmental damage, is it considered whether it might be more advantageous to the environment to use these alternative technologies?  Following on from that, is it suggested to the Minister that he should be knocking on doors in Europe?  We are following the pied piper but, if we are going to achieve the targets the Department is the main instigator in setting, we need to get things changed in Europe.  Should we just wait and hope that the next judgment or ruling is better or that the new legislation or directive being proposed in Europe suits us or are we trying to influence these discussions in a way that will suit us?  That is a question for both parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022030900002#P02000","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I will come in and answer the question on whether we look at the balance.

We look at any potential crop cultivation issues on a case-by-case basis.  It is very timely to bring up this issue as there is now an opportunity to address it through the legislative proposal that is to come back from the European Commission.  We will be in a better position when we see what that legislative proposal entails.  It will give us an opportunity, in consultation with all of the Departments, Government and State agencies and research bodies that are involved, to see whether we need to rethink any of our policy positions.  It is just very timely.  We will get that opportunity once we see what proposals come forward from the European Commission.

I would say \"Yes.\"  Not only Teagasc, but also Irish agriculture is being held back.  I say that as a scientist and through the lens of having a tool or technique that could advance things.  With due regard to the legislators and regulators, they may have to take account of issues such as those raised by Deputy Carthy, including the public's attitude to things and so on.  The scientist's view is sometimes a bit narrow with regard to some things.  Sentiment can often be very powerful and also has to be factored in.  However, specifically from a scientific point of view, if we had access to this technique, we believe we could do better breeding.  We breed three field crops in Ireland: potatoes, clover and grass.  We do not breed wheat, barley or other cereals in Ireland.  While we do have access to this technique, if we could use it in our breeding programmes, we feel we could improve those programmes and develop better varieties of grass, clover and potatoes for Irish farmers.  Wheat, barley and oats are generally bred in other European countries because our market is not big enough to support a breed programme.  If those countries had access to this technique, they would be breeding better varieties for us and we could feed into them the types of traits we would like to see enhanced in the crops they breed.

As Deputy Carthy said earlier, if you go back 20 or 30 years, there was a very strong fear among consumers about these types of new technologies.  That has changed to some extent.  The whole Covid crisis was quite instrumental in building people's trust in science and in what science can do.  We saw the rapid development of a vaccine based on mRNA, which brought that kind of language into people's daily use.  I hope and actually do believe that there is a more mature attitude among people to the use of technology in dealing with the types of problems we are trying to address.  They are difficult problems, such as the Senator has outlined.  We want to increase food production, to reduce the impact on the environment and to improve livelihoods while we are doing so.

There are issues with the pig and poultry industries at the moment.  I had a couple of pig farmers on to me this week.  They are caught in a perfect storm and are under huge pressure.  A man was on to me today who cannot get feed for his pigs.  He was told the barley is not available.  How do the witnesses see those two sectors surviving this?  For dairy, beef and grain, the farm gate price looks like it will respond to the prices that are there but in the white meat sector, the response seems to be the opposite way.  There is a negative price response.  I do not understand, given this food scarcity, why those sectors are under such pressure price-wise.

It is a rapidly evolving situation.  First and foremost, a major humanitarian issue has captured all our attention and sympathy for the people of Ukraine.  On top of that is the impact that will have on our food system.  Over the last six months, we have had a significant challenge for the sector.  We have had rising prices for fertiliser since late last year.  That was a significant challenge, particularly for dry stock farmers.  Dairy farmers' incomes and the price of milk are reasonably good so they are better positioned.  That challenge is being exacerbated and, in addition, feed prices are increasing significantly.<\/p> <p>  The pig sector was already in a significant price-cost squeeze, in that the price of pig meat had fallen and the price of feed has risen quite a bit not only in recent weeks, but in the last few months.  The pig industry has been under serious pressure regarding profitability in recent months and that will be exacerbated with current developments.  We will see increases in the price of grain-based feeds in the coming weeks and have the worry of availability because Ukraine and Russia are big grain-growing and, in the case of Ukraine, grain-exporting countries.  What impact will the war have on short-term supply and product moving out of those regions and getting to Ireland and other countries?  What will be the impact in the medium and long term on next year's harvest in Ukraine.  They are big growers of wheat and maize.  Most of the wheat is sown already.  It is a winter crop.  Will it be harvested?  Will the crops be minded in the growing season?  Will the maize crop that is due to be sown in a month or so get sown?<\/p> <p>  We have huge uncertainty about the global supply of grains and how that will play out in the food and feed markets.  Not too long ago - 2005, I think - we had a spike in grain prices around the world and it led to much civil unrest and regime change.  A huge issue is building.  We need as a country and as individual farmers to make sure we have a secure supply of feed for our animals.  Every farmer needs to look at the number of animals he or she will have next winter and whether there will be sufficient food for them.  That is a big part of the work we will do with farmers to plan the resilience of their feed supply at an individual level for the next year.<\/p> <p>  We are heading into a critical period for livestock farmers in relation to the silage-making season.  Before the Ukraine crisis arose and we were just dealing with the fertiliser issue, we told farmers to make better use of organic manures to reduce the amount of fertiliser they might have to buy, and not to cut short fertilisation, whether organic manures, slurries or chemical nitrogen for their silage crop.  We will double down on those messages with livestock farmers.  <\/p> <p>  We will encourage tillage farmers to see if we can grow more grain in this country.  I will let Mr. Spink come in on this in a minute.  We have a short window left in the sowing season and many of our crops are winter-sown and already in the ground.  Within the remaining period and depending on the availability of seed and the likelihood of having fertiliser to grow those crops, is there an opportunity to grow more grain?<\/p> <p>  Poultry producers and especially pig produces are in the hot seat.  It will be a difficult period for the coming weeks and months, initially regarding affordability of feed and, in the medium or long term, the potential disruption to supplies of feed.  On top of that is the potential disruption to supplies of fertiliser through manufacturing capacity in Russia, which we rely on to a reasonable extent.  Of the order of 30% of our fertiliser, or maybe not quite that high, came from Russia last year.  The price of gas, which is a big component of fertiliser making, went through the roof a long time ago.  I do not know what it has gone through at this stage.  That is all impacting on the fertiliser business.  In my time in the industry I have never seen as much uncertainty around those issues as we have now.<\/p><p>Allied to that uncertainty, I have never seen as high a risk for us.  If things go wrong, they could go very badly wrong in relation to our food supply and the feed supply for our animals.  It is a situation that will require very close monitoring and action and working closely with farmers.  There is a big job to be done to support farmers in terms of securing their fodder supply for the coming year.

To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people's physical space, and they are also asked to adhere to any other public health advice.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.

The committee will undertake <i>ex ante <\/i>scrutiny of the SPU to understand the current fiscal context, to engage with stakeholders on these issues and to allow for greater parliamentary engagement and transparency on the budgetary process.  Today, the committee will meet with the ESRI to discuss medium-term fiscal and economic outlooks, Exchequer and general government developments and outlooks, general government debt risks facing the economy and the long-term sustainability of the public finances.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Conor O&rsquo;Toole.  We are grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee to provide our views on the present economic and fiscal situation and to discuss some key issues and risks that the medium-term fiscal strategy should consider.  Obviously, events are changing day by day as far as economic issues are concerned in regard to the awful circumstances in the Ukraine, so some of our forecasts have not yet incorporated the exact implications of that.  We will address that in our next quarterly economic commentary, which is out at the end of the month.  We will endeavour to discuss some of the issues today in terms of how we see them impacting the medium-term outlook.<\/p><p>The economy has emerged from the pandemic in a robust manner.  Work conducted in the ESRI suggests that the economy grew by approximately 4.5% to 5% per annum between 2013 and 2019.  This meant that the economy went into the pandemic in a strong position, which provided economic space to deal with the economic shock and emerge in a resilient fashion.  However, a number of challenges are set to confront the domestic economy and these have been exacerbated by the fallout from the recent invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.  We will discuss the potential fallout from the invasion in the risks section later.<\/p><p> I will turn to the fiscal and economic outlook.  The improved situation with regards to the Covid-19 pandemic enabled the Government to lift almost all of the public health restrictions as of 28 February 2022.  This has allowed for a re-normalisation of economic activity similar to that which operated before the onset of the global pandemic.  The unwinding of public health restrictions through 2021 did result in strong recoveries in both consumption and underlying investment, while the export sector of the economy performed robustly throughout the pandemic.  In 2021, we estimate that GDP grew by 13.6%, with modified domestic demand, MDD, increasing by 6.2%.  For the present year, this trend is set to continue with MDD expected to grow by 7.1%.  It will continue to grow strongly.  This reflects strong contributions from both domestic and external sources of growth.<\/p><p> The labour market experienced a sustained improvement throughout 2021.  Unemployment, which peaked in February 2021 at 27%, fell to 7% most recently in February of this year.  This strong recovery is set to continue and by the end of the current year, we expect the unemployment rate to fall to 5%.  The rapid decline in the unemployment rate, coupled with the strong domestic economic rebound, gives rise to the possibility of labour supply bottlenecks and associated risks for overheating in the economy.  The strength of the economic performance is reflected in the improvement in the public finances.  This year, 2022, is likely to see the first positive general government balance, GGB, since 2019; this reflects both increased Exchequer receipts and lower expenditure given the fall-off in unemployment during the pandemic.<\/p><p> With regard to the public finances, 2021 witnessed significant growth under almost all tax headings, with particularly large takings of income tax, VAT, and corporation tax.  These three tax headings saw annual growth of 17.4%, 24.3% and 10.3%, respectively.  The overall tax intake was &euro;68.4 billion in 2021.  Expenditure for the year was 2.6% higher in 2021 compared to 2020, however, it was &euro;1.4 billion, or 1.5%, lower than had been allocated for 2021.  The lower-than-allocated spending as well as the substantial tax intake produced a general government deficit of -3.1% of GNI*, or -&euro;7.3billion, for 2021.  This is significantly smaller than was expected at the onset of the year.  Debt levels have increased substantially over the past two years due to the large State intervention in response to the pandemic.  However, the strong performance of the economy has resulted in Ireland's debt-to-GDP and debt-to-GNI* ratios being somewhat lower in 2022 than they were in 2019, just before the pandemic.  It should be noted that the suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact has also contributed to the ability of governments to intervene during the public health crisis.  At the moment, reforms of the European Union fiscal rules are being debated, with some proposals suggesting that expenditure on climate-related matters should be excluded from the new rules that are proposed.  The return of the public finances to a sustainable path so soon after the significant costs of the pandemic gives rise to important policy questions concerning fiscal policy going forward.  Given the Government's stated plans for expenditure levels over the coming years, improvements in the public finances are likely to see a persistent fall in the debt-to-output ratio, whether output is classified as GDP or GNI*.  Indeed, if the current trajectory of the public finances were to continue, the debt-to-GDP ratio could, quite soon, fall to rates not seen since the mid-2000s.  However, should Government policy be aimed at achieving as low a debt-to-output ratio as possible or should a certain target be set, as suggested in a well-known contribution by economists, Jason Furman and Larry Summers in 2020?<\/p><p> I will now turn to risks in the medium term.  Despite the significant upturn, a number of factors pose challenges to the economy and living standards in the near future.  In the short-term, rising inflation and the cost of living are particularly pressing.  The most recent data indicates that the annual inflation rate was 5% for both the CPI and the HICP in January 2022.  This inflation is largely a result of international factors, with energy and transport costs being the main driver of the rising cost of living.  This is due to supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and a faster-than-expected economic revival globally.  The rising energy costs are putting pressure on households and on lower-income households in particular.  It is believed, however, that these inflationary effects are temporary, with many expecting the supply chain issues and other pressures to ease through 2022.  We have forecast an average inflation rate of 4% in 2022, with a peak in spring followed by decreases as base effects subside and supply chain issues are resolved.  However, we will revisit that forecast soon.  The forecasts were published before the recent crisis in Ukraine and the price of oil and gas has already risen since the actions taken by the Russian Federation.  Sanctions have been placed on the Russian economy and although no sanctions have yet been placed on the energy sector of the country by the European Union, this has been discussed as a possibility.  It seems likely that energy prices are set to increase further.  Indeed, recent research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, NIESR, in the UK suggests the global inflation rate could rise by 3% this year alone.  This could have significant implications for the recalibration of monetary policy by the European Central Bank, ECB.  To date, the general assumption has been that the recent increase in inflation was temporary and, hence, policy rates have been left unchanged in the short term.  This policy may change if higher inflation rates are expected to persist, although the ECB will also factor in the impact of the crisis on the growth performance of the euro area.  Over the medium term, western authorities may decide to reduce European consumption of Russian gas and oil.  This would almost inevitably lead to higher energy bills over the short to medium future.  There has been significant research, even in recent days, on this matter.  More generally, the radical shift in the geopolitical landscape will inevitably result in a sharp rise in international business uncertainty.  This uncertainty is likely to drive growth lower in the general precautionary savings channels.  The Irish economy, owing to its small and open nature, is particularly sensitive to significant changes in global economic activity.  Preliminary estimates from the ECB indicate that the conflict could reduce economic output in the euro area by up to 0.4% this year.  Previous modelling work done using the COre Structural MOdel, COSMO, the large-scale macro-econometric model of the economy, indicates a 1:1 relationship between global and domestic economic activity.  The aforementioned study by NIESR in the UK indicates that the potential impact on global growth of the Russian invasion could be in the region of 1%.  Most of the key drivers of the recent surge in inflation, such as the increase in energy costs, have been external to the domestic economy.  However, one key element of recent increases in the cost of living, which reflects domestic challenges, is the cost of housing.  Recent estimates from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicate that house prices are now growing by 14% per annum, while rents are growing by 8%, according to indicators from the ESRI and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  These increases are on top of sustained increases in both categories over the past six to seven years.  The pandemic, which had a negative impact on the supply side of the housing market, has exacerbated the pre-existing imbalance between supply and demand in the economy.  While a number of affordability-related issues are associated with these increases, one area where it may have a direct impact on domestic economic performance is through a loss of competitiveness.  The lack of adequate housing supply has been identified by a number of domestic and external agencies as being one of the biggest challenges to our competitiveness as an economy.  The recent Housing for All initiative by the Government is welcome in terms of its multi-annual targets and expenditure commitments, and the State must continue to focus on the delivery of social and affordable housing to tackle this issue.<\/p><p> Another significant challenge facing the economy over the medium term is that of climate change and the green transition.  Through the recent Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the State has committed to an emissions reduction path of 51% by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.  The importance of such a commitment is widely recognised, but it is also acknowledged that meeting such targets, along with tackling the housing issue, will require significant investment by the State going forward.<\/p><p> The economy has recovered strongly from the pandemic and both it and the public finances are on a firm footing at present but international factors could have a large effect on the domestic economy.  Inflation has prompted a policy response from the Government in the form of energy credit payments and it is not inconceivable that other policy responses will be required if these international circumstances worsen further, with particular attention being paid to the conflict ensuing in Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McQuinn.

One area we are particularly cognisant of, and pay particular attention to, is the construction sector.  The Housing for All plan sets out quite significant targets for meeting housing supply over the coming years, with which most of us would agree and wish to see occurring.  However, there is no doubt it will pose a significant challenge in achieving those targets and the ratcheting up of supply.  We are looking to increase housing supply at a time when the unemployment rate is heading towards 5% this year.  That will pose a significant challenge in getting the workers necessary to achieve that output level.  This is one sector of the economy that is likely to experience difficulties in achieving that.<\/p> <p>  On what can be done, some of the issues are more long term, such as improving training programmes and getting people back into the supply side of the construction sector.  Net immigration and migration may also play a very important role.  We have in the past seen a large influx of workers into the country who were targeted more at the construction end of the scale in terms of where they could contribute.  That probably is the most pressing area in which we would envisage bottlenecks arising but there are others within the economy.  My colleague, Dr. O'Toole, may want to comment on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Coming into 2020, our expectation was for quite a rapid recovery in the domestic economy, particularly as the public health requirements were stood down over time.  The outturn of the abatement of the public health restrictions would lead us to assume that this rapid recovery will happen in the domestic economy.  Our expectation was that the expenditure we expected to happen this year would go into the types of activities households were unable to do during the pandemic.  For example, the expectation was that it would be targeted towards entertainment, recreation, hospitality and accommodation.  We expected that these really hard-hit sectors, which required public interaction, would see a recovery.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the geopolitical tensions, if the recovery does materialise in those sectors, there may also be capacity constraints in getting the labour in there, particularly in the short run.  These are sectors where people may have been laid off for long periods during the public health restrictions and who may have taken up other employment.  A number of frictions may have caused the traditional labour pool for those sectors to have moved away a little.  The construction sector certainly is a key issue but there may be other domestic non-traded sectors in which, if the demand comes back following the easing of restrictions, there could be bottlenecks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

Potentially, excluding climate change expenditure is a good idea and there are a number of reasons to argue for it.  Obviously, this is an issue that is confronting nearly all countries in the European Union and there is a possibility to get agreement across many of them.  Investment is required.  One advantage of having climate measures excluded from the rules is that, arguably, it will enable the Government to commit to them on a multi-annual basis.  With the crisis emerging in Ukraine, we have seen domestically that there is always a danger that the climate change agenda could be derailed by the issues that are pressing today.  However, we all agree that, in the longer term or even the medium term, climate change is the hugely important issue.  Having measures in that area excluded from the fiscal rules would give them a certain degree of security of funding by domestic governments and ensure this funding is not thrown off course by urgent issues that might arise on a day-to-day basis.<\/p> <p>  There also is the possibility for other areas of expenditure to be excluded from the fiscal rules.  Housing is an area that could be considered.  The housing issues and difficulties we have in Ireland are not specific to the Irish market.  We see constant reference right across Europe to difficulties that are being experienced in this area in other jurisdictions.  I would argue that we could even look to exclude expenditure on housing.  We know there is an overlap between climate change and housing in terms of the retrofitting issue.  There clearly are areas that could be developed in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>My final question is kind of off the cuff.

Our next quarterly commentary will come out at the end of this month, in which the matter will very much be addressed.  When there is major geopolitical tension or an actual conflict like we currently have, there clearly is huge uncertainty around that.  We do not know how long the conflict will last, how widespread it will be, the danger of proliferation to other countries, etc.  That leads to a massive degree of uncertainty and, generally speaking, business does not like uncertainty when it comes to making investment decisions.  Investment will be impacted in a global sense.  Likewise, generally speaking, households do not like to make significant financial decisions when there is a considerable degree of uncertainty.  Consumption levels will be impacted, as will trade levels generally.<\/p> <p>  There will be direct trade impacts through the sanctions against Russia and because it is a huge exporter of grain.  We have seen the pressure on the grain and cereal market generally over the past week or so.  There also are indirect effects.  We do not have a huge volume of trade with Russia directly but we have a lot of trade with other countries that trade with it.  There are potential spillover and knock-on effects in that sense.  As a small, open economy, we are going to see a contraction in international economic activity, both in the euro area and outside it.  There is no doubt this will have a direct bearing on the domestic economy.  It has been shown time after time in studies that when there is a major international shock, it very much transmits down into the domestic economy.<\/p> <p>  The other area of impact, of course, is on prices.  Energy prices, as we all know, have been escalating very sharply, having already risen quite significantly over the past six months.  It is a long time since we have seen the kinds of increases in energy prices we are now witnessing.  This will pose a significant challenge both to households and firms.  There is no doubt about that and there is a substantial increase in inflation associated with it.  Unfortunately, as we have seen, lower-income households, from a distributional perspective, tend to be hit disproportionately by that type of serious increase in inflation.<\/p> <p>  There are knock-on effects on the public finances.  We have seen a number of initiatives taken by the Government, even in the past couple of weeks, all of which carry a cost.  We are somewhat fortunate in that the public finances, as we said in our opening statement, are on a relatively stable path so soon after the pandemic.  That gives the Government some scope to deal with these issues.  As to the scale of it, we just do not know.  It all depends on the scale and length of the hostilities.  We are seeing a massive humanitarian issue, with millions of people leaving Ukraine.  The Government has welcomed in a lot of people, which is right and proper to do.  Inevitably, there will be expenditure issues around this that will have to be dealt with.  There are a number of different channels through which the conflict will impact the domestic economy.<\/p><p>At this stage it is hard to be definitive about the exact effects.

I will start where he left off with Deputy Ryan.  If a comparison was done between Covid-19 over the past two years and what is now happening in Ukraine, which is the bigger worry for us?  Looking at agriculture and food security, Professor McQuinn said we do not trade much with Russia.  However, Russia produces much of the world's fertiliser which is important for us.  Ukraine produces much of the grain we need for feed as well as seeds to sow our own grain.  We have a perfect storm there.  Now we are talking about adapting our farming and our agricultural practices to do more tillage to produce more of the basic ingredients we need in order that we have the foodstuffs for ourselves and for the animals in winter so that we can continue to produce beef and dairy produce.

On a straight comparison between the two issues, it is hard at this stage to quantify that.  We had two years of the pandemic, although within those two years we had periods of opening up and closing down.<\/p> <p>  As for the economic effects overall, the economy still managed to grow quite strongly through the pandemic.  That is one of the remarkable features of it.  It is a testimony to how strong the Irish economy was performing before the pandemic that it came through the pandemic in quite a strong position.  Certain sectors were obviously very badly affected but in general the economy came through quite strongly.  As I said, in terms of the fiscal side, the Government and the State spent a great deal of money on the support measures, the pandemic unemployment payment, the wage subsidy schemes, additional expenditure on health and so on, but the key fiscal metrics of debt to GDP, the Government balance, have come back to a more sustainable path in a very quick fashion after the pandemic because of how strongly the economy has been performing.  The pandemic had a huge impact but in general terms the economy managed to keep going through it and, as we said, has come out in a very strong position in the immediate aftermath.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Ukrainian situation, it depends on how long the conflict goes on, and how widespread it becomes.  That is the key issue.  At this stage, it is very hard to tell.  However, there have already been significant economic impacts, as we have seen.  The Deputy mentioned grain prices and the impact on agricultural input prices in terms of fertilisers.  There is no doubt that has had a huge impact and will have a big impact right across the globe.  The energy market repercussions from this could be huge.  We have seen the US and the UK authorities minimising or reducing completely their reliance on Russian oil.  We have seen growing pressure for the European authorities to do likewise.  The desire to reduce energy dependence on Russia is perfectly understandable but it comes with an enormous cost transformation.  It would entail a significant amount of transformation right across the economy.<\/p> <p>  These are very hard to quantify at this point in time but certainly the downside risks associated with this are substantial and are possibly greater than anything we saw during the pandemic.  Equally we do not know whether the whole situation could possibly be resolved quite quickly.  If there was a change of government or whatever in Russia, then the military action could be reversed.  It is difficult to assess how significant the measures will be over the medium term but certainly in the short term, we have seen significant economic implications of the crisis.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the implications for agriculture directly, as I said, I spent some time modelling the grain sector years ago.  I know from my knowledge there that it is not the easiest thing.  Sometimes people looking on from outside think you can switch production from beef and dry stock to tillage or from dairy to tillage.  It is not that easy.  It requires significant adjustment and so on.  I do not think anybody should underestimate the challenges in terms of doing that and underestimate the impact of increasing costs on agricultural production.  These costs are obviously going to come through myriad channels as a result of this.  There are serious challenges for agriculture as well as the rest of the domestic economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Professor McQuinn spoke about the fiscal rules.

There has been noticeable change in the way they reacted to the pandemic in terms of suspending the fiscal rules and providing supports which they previously had not been as quick to do.  European institutions have learned much and reacted to the pandemic in a good manner in terms of trying to ensure economies got through the crisis and were not thrown off too much and that policy decisions made by the European institutions did not themselves bring about contractions in economic activity.  That will colour and influence decisions going forward in regard to this issue.  People will realise that you cannot just reimpose the fiscal rules given the huge uncertainly prevailing.  It would be very difficult ask to try to get governments to take on board the full implications of the fiscal rules in the present context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The next big issue or crisis is housing.  What has been a housing crisis will be compounded by the fact that we will probably have 80,000 or 100,000 - those figures have been bandied about - more people who will need housing as a matter of urgency over the next 12 months.  How do we deal with that and the existing shortfall?  In my book it could be a case of taking out some of the processes that exist at the moment and getting on with building, as opposed to having processes which mean it takes between five to seven years for a project to get off the ground, and bringing in emergency measures to allow us to get to the stage where we are building and putting in infrastructure, such as water and sewerage, in places where it is needed.  That will take money and resources.  Are we in a position to front-load our national development plan starting now, and not just projects that might be delivered over time but putting up buildings to house people so that they can live in a humane way?

We are not even meeting the yearly requirement.  That leads not only to missing out on meeting the annual requirement but also to an accumulation in the shortfall over time.  As everybody knows, there is a major task in meeting the challenge that already exists in the housing market.  Clearly, if there is an additional increase in the structural demand to house between 50,000 and 100,000 people due to the Ukrainian issue, that will compound the existing difficulties.  Significant increases in revenues have been pledged on foot of the Government&rsquo;s multi-annual commitments under the Housing for All strategy.  One could argue that perhaps more money could be pledged but the fundamental problem will be the capacity to get the workers and materials required to meet that housing demand.  That is where the challenge will be.  It is worth remembering that the energy and other related costs we mentioned earlier are all directly affecting the housing market as they are affecting many other markets.  We have seen very sharp increases in housing costs.  Those directly impact the ability of the industry to provide the supply needed.  It would be worth considering any measures that can fast-track the supply given the challenges that will probably exist as we go forward.  We are facing a very significant challenge in that regard.

It is rapidly rising in ways we have not seen for many years.  The risks in terms of direct price effects cannot be understated with respect to how much they could affect building costs and materials.  All of these commodities are internationally traded and will increase in line with the stresses we are seeing in the international markets.  That can feed through directly into our ability to meet even our current commitments and current envisaged investments in the housing sector.  We cannot understate the risks associated with how the propagation of the severe price stress we are seeing will feed back into the Irish economy.  It is certainly a major risk which is very difficult to deal with in the short term.  Housing issues take a long time to deal with.

We would have been arguing against that and saying that is not something we want to see.  Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely the inflationary issue is going to go away in the short term.  Everything we see in terms of the energy markets, cereal prices, grains and commodity markets is pointing to much higher prices certainly for the foreseeable future.

As to how long and severe it will be, it is a question of how long the crisis lasts and the conflict continues.

As we suggested in our opening statement, a situation like this initially brings a large degree of uncertainty, and uncertainty is bad for business decisions on investments and consumption decisions by households.  It has an adverse impact on global trade in a myriad of fashions.  All the major drivers of growth that we can envisage are impacted across western economies.  We are a small open economy.  Typically, there is a 1:1 relationship between Irish economic activity and global economic activity.  If global economic activity falls by 1 percentage point, Irish economic activity tends to fall by 1 percentage point.<\/p> <p>  That is the overall uncertainty effect, but then there are cost-of-living issues.  Energy costs have increased sharply.  Much will depend on the scale and duration of the conflict; that will determine the point.  In the short term, though, there will be significant increases in energy costs, commodity prices, grain prices and the prices for related agricultural products and inputs.  We are looking at a substantial increase in the cost of living across the board.  What its duration will be depends on the scale of the conflict.<\/p> <p>  This poses a challenge for the public finances, given that the measures the Government has introduced to deal with the inflationary issues come with a price tag.  It may well be the case that more such interventions will be required in the months and, possibly, years ahead.  Those will also have significant price tags.  From the overall impact on economic activity to the impact on the cost of living and the public finances, there is a substantial effect.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the comparison between this situation and the pandemic, it is too early to say.  We will have to wait to see how long it lasts.  As I told Deputy Canney in response to pretty much the same question, the pandemic had an impact on the Irish economy, but the resilience of our economy enabled it to come through in quite a strong fashion.  While there are sectors that are still suffering from its effects, the economy performed in a resilient fashion overall and the public finances were able to be returned to a sustainable path quickly.

To answer the Deputy's question on whether we achieve overheating, since the domestic economy is growing very strongly, when the unemployment rate starts to go below 5% is typically when we see inflationary pressures building in the domestic economy.  We are still a little way off that.  The unemployment rate is approximately 7% but given that inflationary pressures are building anyway in the domestic economy, it means whatever supports we give should be as targeted as possible so they are getting to the people who need them the most and, if possible, are not spreading out towards the more general economy where they may contribute to inflationary pressures.  In essence, whatever intervention is introduced should be as targeted as possible and reach in particular the people whose incomes and livelihoods are most threatened and challenged by the inflationary period.<\/p> <p>  Stagflation, which is in effect high inflation and low input, is something that could occur at an international level, certainly, and possibly even in the euro area.

We appreciate their time very much.  I will touch on two specific issues because we are trying to figure out all that is happening at present and trying to look around corners when we see what is happening with inflation and the implications of the war.  Every one of us is acutely aware of the sanctions the world is putting on Russia but since the representatives have expertise, have they got any insight they could give us on this?  What is their view of the implications of the possible sanctions that Russia will put on us?  I am talking about the disconnection of energy, fuel supplies and the general trade we have.  We have talked about our inward trade; I am talking about the way we might rely on Russia.

At present, I feel very bad to be even talking in this way about the economy, economics, money and trade at a time when innocent women, children and men are being murdered and run out of their homes and places of living, but I am only doing my job.  I have to ask questions when we have experts such as the ESRI representatives before us.  Do not think I am being cold-hearted in asking questions about finances and ignoring the most important thing of all, which is the tragedy that is befalling these lovely people.  It was so nice today to be able to meet and support the Ukrainian ambassador after she was kindly invited to the D&aacute;il.  There was a massive outpouring of support for her and her people.

No one can forget that but, as a public representative, I also have to be hard about it and ask the representatives about food security of supply to Ireland and fuel security of supply.  We already hear of rationing of fuel.  I know of agricultural contractors and, indeed, farmers, being told they will get half of what they are looking for.<\/p> <p>  I am asking about those two specific issues, the other being Ukraine, which obviously has to make decisions with regard to trade and everything because it has to try to protect itself.

Russia has already been making noises about reducing the energy supply.  It is even cutting off completely the gas that is supplied, particularly to Europe.  We know that Europe in general has a high dependency on Russian gas.  Germany, in particular, has a very high dependency since approximately 40% of its gas comes from Russia.  That is a very high dependency and there is a significant threat from the Russians to cut off energy.  However, it is worth bearing in mind that gas and oil are probably the only two commodities that Russia is now trading with the rest of the world and are certainly the two main ones.  They are worth a huge sum or value of cash to the Russian economy every day.  Europe, in general, is paying somewhere in the region of almost &euro;1 billion a day to the Russians in payments for gas and oil.  In fact, our energy consumption of gas and oil has increased over the past week or so.  We have been paying more for gas and oil to Russia than previously.  That is one of the elements.<\/p> <p>  Whether the Russians would carry through on a threat to limit supplies of gas and oil to Europe is a vexed question.  However, there is growing discussion about the possibility of Europe pulling the plug on supplies of gas and oil.  Again, to date, it has been very reluctant to do so but we have seen the actions of the US authorities in banning imports of Russian oil, while the UK has said it will cease all imports of Russian oil by the end of the year.  At a European level, one suspects that the clamour for this action will possibly grow in the weeks and months ahead, especially if the humanitarian situation in Ukraine deteriorates because it is ultimately the one last and most severe economic sanction the West can undertake.<\/p> <p>  Whichever way it comes, whether Europe decides to stop or change its imports of gas or the Russians decide to pull the plug, it is fair to say there will probably be a significant transformation in European energy use, certainly over the next year or two, in terms of what ensues from this crisis.  That will bring major challenges - there is no other way to say it - and possibly quite substantial increases in energy costs in the short term as we try to adapt.  As I said, quite a lot of work has already been done by various European agencies in looking at the challenges that would bring in respect of how quickly we could bring in liquid gas as a potential substitute, or even again looking at the possibility of nuclear power etc.  These questions are all being teased out and discussed at this time.<\/p> <p>  Our trade with Russia is quite limited although, and Dr. O'Toole is in a good position to comment as he has been looking at this, in certain key sectors of the economy the quantity of goods we import from Russia is quite high.  Dr. O'Toole will possibly be able to talk about that.

Other headline companies have quite significant plants and possibly exposures in the Russian economy.

The likes of Kerry Group and CRH have a substantial presence in the Russian market.  It is probably too early to tease out exactly what the implications are in respect of those issues.  While our direct exposure is quite limited, there is no doubt that the fact Russia supplies so much energy and agricultural produce to western markets means this will certainly have a general impact on producer prices, cereal prices and grain and food prices here.<\/p><p>As I stated, the impact from the energy component alone will be substantial in terms of the pressures it will bring on household incomes.

In terms of a broader default by the Russian state itself, these things can be difficult to assess.  We do not fully know what the knock-on implications may be.  Outside the IFSC issue, I do not think we have any particular exposure in terms of Russian finance generally as far as our financial sector is concerned, but clearly there would be an impact in terms of, for instance, risk premiums generally and the setting of interest rates.  That would have a knock-on effect on interbank interest rates and possibly on interest rates at the household and firm level.  If there is a major international episode such as a default, especially by a sizeable economy such as the Russian one, it would have knock-on effects.  The one channel that would affect straight away would be through the risk premiums channel and that would lead to an increase in interest rates charged throughout the financial system, whether interbank rates or possibly rates that are set in terms of households and firms.

Those countries are more exposed to defaults not only by the Russian state but by banks in Russia with which they have exposures.  There is always the possibility of contagion from financial stability mechanisms propagating through the system.  The banking sector in particular is a lot stronger now than it was at the start of the financial crisis.  The European banks are very well capitalised.

Obviously, a lot will depend on the response of the European Central Bank and the monetary authorities there.  Indeed, the whole issue of future interest rates will be very interesting because, typically in the case of a very sharp pick-up in inflation such as we are witnessing now and are likely to witness going forward, the standard response of the ECB and other agencies would be to increase interest rates as a way of controlling inflation.  To date, the ECB has been reluctant to do so in the context of the inflation increases we have seen prior to the Ukrainian issue.  That has mainly been because, as I stated in response to an earlier question, many of the European institutions are cognisant of some of the mistakes that were possibly made during the financial crisis when, for instance, there was a tightening by the ECB of monetary policy in 2008 and 2012.  In hindsight, people regard that as a profound mistake.  The danger is that if one starts to tighten monetary policy at the wrong time, it will choke the recovery of economies from the pandemic.  Of course, now economies will also be hit by this significant shock from the Ukrainian situation and that will counterbalance to a certain extent what the ECB decides to do in response to inflation.  It is a very difficult position for the ECB to be in.  It will witness substantial increases in inflation but it will also be mindful of the effect the crisis is having on everyday economic activity and it is going to try to sustain that economic activity through this crisis in the way it did during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the way the ECB has been dealing with it to date and in the context of the kind of asset purchasing schemes it has in place, the way in which it signalled it was going to deal with the inflationary issue was to wind down those asset purchase schemes initially and maybe accelerate the winding down of those schemes before it would start to increase the policy rate itself.  Of course, it is possible it will not wind down those asset purchase schemes if, for instance, it sees that countries are getting into difficulty in terms of sustaining the fiscal costs that may come about as a result of the crisis.  It is a sticky wicket for the ECB in terms of how it deals with and reacts to the present situation.  Clearly, its response will be crucial in terms of the scale of the impact of a Russian economy default and its impact on interest rates within the euro area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McQuinn.

What are the determinants of that?  How is that likely to evolve or change in the future?  Larry Summers has done considerable work on why we have had such low interest rates over a longer period of time.  One of the reasons highlighted in western economies is the demographic shift that is being observed in societies.  It is also tied into the relatively low rates of economic growth in western economies in Europe and the United States in recent years.  Consequently, there has not been the pressure on interest rates there was previously.<\/p> <p>  A number of factors are contributing to the low interest rate environment.  Obviously, policies of central banks have been instrumental, particularly in the euro area in the past ten years, in keeping interest rates low.  The determinants of why the natural long-run interest rate is so low are likely to remain the case in the long run.  Obviously, the major shock of the whole Ukrainian issue, especially the energy price shock, could disrupt that in the short to medium term.

One of the points they make, which is very much related to that, is the kind of target we should be setting.  This ties into the discussion about the fiscal rules and fiscal policy and whether we should be targeting a specific debt-GDP ratio.  For instance, should we aim for a debt-GDP ratio of 30%, 35% or 40%?  Once we hit that rate, we could then adjust our budgetary position in response to that.  For instance, in May if we are able to hit a specific debt-GDP ratio, we could still possibly engage in some degree of borrowing.  I wrote a paper last summer that looked at that particular issue in some detail, assessing what we could do in an Irish context.  Could we specifically target a certain debt-GDP ratio and then, given the likely growth rate in the economy and the likely outlook for sovereign debt costs, could we possibly borrow and still meet that target?  The evidence suggests we could.<\/p> <p>  These are very interesting and important fiscal policy decisions we need to think about.  If we did not have the awful Ukraine situation, we would be saying quite conclusively that the fiscal metrics are improving quite strongly in the Irish economy.  Even given the significant cost outlay associated with the pandemic, the debt-GDP ratio and debt-GNI* ratio will be lower at the end of this year than they were in 2019.  There has been a downward trajectory as far as those debt-GDP ratios have been concerned ever since the financial crisis.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues we were flagging was whether we will just continually run down the debt-GDP ratio over the coming years.  Will we just try to get it as low as we can, similar to where it was prior to the financial crisis, or do we set a target of, for example, 35% or 40% and then, once we are clearly hitting that target, we will be able to generate surplus funds we can use for investment purposes in areas such as housing and climate change.<\/p> <p>  That is an important debate.

If we are into a persistent period of much higher energy prices, that will ultimately feed into higher inflation and will ultimately feed through to higher interest rates as far as central banks are concerned.  They will need to start increasing policy rates at some stage to get a handle or put a lid on the inflationary issue.  If the crisis is relatively short-lived somehow - obviously we all hope it is - and we see some return to fairly normal energy prices, maybe by the latter half of this year, then it is quite feasible we will see a return to the kind of longer term path where interest rates are concerned.  However, in the short term we need to be prepared for the possibility of policy rate increases given the sheer inflationary impact that is likely to occur from energy prices.<\/p> <p>  The argument Furman and Summers put forward is to simply adjust budgetary stance.  The same framework can still be used.  It just requires factoring in higher interest rate charges and possibly a lower GDP growth rate because of the effect of the crisis, and that will ultimately change the target to be set.  The framework they are suggesting to be applied is just as valid into the future irrespective of the Ukrainian situation.

The traded sector of our economy is hugely important, particularly the multinational element of that.  We saw that during the pandemic.  The multinational element of our traded sector actually performed very strongly, which is why overall economic growth actually increased in 2020 when economic growth in every other country was declining.

If the ECB decides to try to insulate households and firms in the euro area from those upward pressures, it can do that.  Much will depend on its response.

These are very difficult times and it will be interesting to see how that develops in that side of things.  There is much talk about inflation as well at present.  This committee has just issued its inflation report, which recognises that the underlying causes of the inflation are external and can be attributed to things such as supply chains taking time to reopen and so forth.  I am conscious that an increase in interest rates is unlikely to impact on those things, but would make the cost of borrowing more expensive.  What are Dr. McQuinn's thoughts on that?

Like most commentators, our view on inflation was that it was temporary in nature.  The inflationary pressures we witness, particularly the energy market issues we saw and other elements, were down to the energy market and supply chain issues.  There were obviously base effects as well which were working through the system in the latter part of last year and into this year.  We felt those pressures would abate as we moved through 2022 and that, by the end of this period, the inflation rate would be back at the target ECB rate of approximately 2% across most euro area countries.  In that context, we felt that the ECB probably would have been unlikely, certainly in the short term, to increase policy rates.  It may do other things such as scale back some of the debt programmes or the support programmes it has, the asset purchasing schemes and so forth, but it was unlikely to increase policy rates.<\/p> <p>  The events of the last two weeks have potentially changed that considerably.  Inflationary pressures are now likely to emerge particularly to do with issues concerning energy but also to do with food, and we have seen the huge pressure in areas such as cereals, grains, wheat and other commodities that originate both in Ukraine and Russia.  The upward pressures that are likely to come on price levels from the events of the last two weeks probably are going to be quite significant and, depending on how long the events last, could be quite persistent.  In that context the ECB will probably have to look at rates being raised possibly sooner than it would have anticipated.  Again, however, it will depend on the overall impact of the crisis on the performance of euro area economies.  The ECB will be mindful of the fact that if it starts to increase policy rates, there may begin to be some concerns about sovereign debt sustainability in certain euro area countries, so it might be reluctant to do so.  It is a very difficult position for the ECB.  On the face of it, substantial increases in inflation, probably like what we are going to witness, would generally be met with higher interest rates and an increase in policy rates, but the implications of the crisis for the growth rates of individual euro area countries and consequently the sustainability of their debt will be an issue as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>The ECB was very clear before this crisis, and it could not have been clearer, that it was not going to follow the US in that regard.

There is a lot of institutional memory there, as it were, in terms of the impact that those rather hasty increases in policy rates had, so I believe that is still influencing decision-making in the ECB at this juncture.

We have seen in recent times here that there is significant pressure on some of the climate change policies because of what is happening in the Ukrainian crisis, so it important that we ring-fence the expenditure levels on those issues in order to effect climate change over the longer term.  One way of doing that would be to exempt certain climate change expenditure levels in the fiscal rules.  I also believe it could even be extended further to commonly accepted areas such as expenditure on housing which, as we said earlier, is not just an Irish issue but an issue across the euro area in terms of the need for more social and affordable housing and more involvement by governments in providing that.  There are a couple of areas where there could be exceptions built into any reform of the fiscal rules.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the fiscal rules in general, we mentioned the research by Jason Furman and Larry Summers.  Other more recent research by Olivier Blanchard has provided quite a lot of interesting insights into where the fiscal rules should go.  There is a need for greater clarity, for them to be more transparent and for them to be more comprehensive as far as lay people are concerned.  Often they have got very much attached to very technical definitions that are not only hard to estimate but hard to explain to the lay person.  There are many areas where the rules could be reformed, but certainly I believe, in principle, excluding certain areas of government expenditure, particularly relating to climate change and also relating to certain elements of housing, would be a good idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022030900002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

If Tusla does not have information about a relevant person when the person applies, this proposed provision would place a statutory obligation on Tusla to look for that information elsewhere.  Tusla's focus needs to be on getting the information it has and providing that to adopted people.  Thousands of people will seek that information.  To provide a statutory obligation on Tusla to look for information it does not have and which it does not know even exists is incredibly uncertain.  To make this a statutory obligation, when there is no certainty that the obligation could ever be fulfilled, is not the best use of Tusla's resources.

Recommendation 14 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAll information is part of an adopted person's history and heritage and must be included in the records provided to them, including: information relevant to treatment, including medical records and evidence of possible abuse[.] <\/blockquote> <p>The proposer may correct me but I read the amendment as saying that persons who apply should have made available to them all medical records, regardless of whether they have explicitly requested a particular medical record.  That is of value because persons seeking medical records may not know, for example, that they had a vaccine test administered to them as children.  Unfortunately, that is often the case and I have met individuals for whom that has been an issue.  They may not know that and they may not know to request that record.  This amendment seeks to ensure they would get access to particular aspects of medical records they may not have known to apply for.<\/p><p>There may be a better way to draft the amendment to ensure that is its effect.  It should not be read as denying agency but as ensuring that a person gets the fullest of information available without needing to apply for specific types of information.  I am thinking specifically of vaccine trials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#D00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>It has been explained better by Deputy Bacik but that is what we sought to do with this amendment.

It speaks to one of the key issues raised by adopted people, namely, that they are denied information about their medical history that could be relevant to their health and that this occurs because they do not know who their parents are and they do not know their family medical history.  It is very important to remember what we are providing for here.  We are providing for a person to have a legal right to somebody else's medical information, which is the medical information of a third party.  In the discussions on this, we all understand that the equivalence is drawn by saying we would know if our mothers had heart disease, a hereditary cancer or something like that.  In most cases, that would be the case but none of us here has a legal right to our mother's or father's medical information.  If a parent chose to withhold something from us for whatever reason, bizarre as that may seem, he or she has a right to do so.<\/p> <p>  We are providing for an adopted person to have a legal right to the medical information of somebody else.  That limits the privacy rights of the other person.  If we are to allow that interference with another person's privacy rights, some protections must be provided.  The protections are that the information being given to the adopted person about his or her parent is relevant to the adopted person's health.  Let us be very clear, \"relevant\" is not limited to a question about one illness or disease.  \"Relevant\" means it is relevant to the person's health.  Any genetic or hereditary condition that is on file about the parent falls within the definition of relevant and would be conveyed to the adopted person.<\/p> <p>  The second protection, which we will also cover later, is that this information is not conveyed directly to the adopted person but it would be conveyed to a medical practitioner in order that there will be an intermediary in the provision of such information.  This is not the case when we are talking about the adopted person's own medical records, for which full release is provided, as we discussed earlier.<\/p> <p>  This provision is a dramatic but necessary interference with the privacy rights of the parents in these circumstances.  When the medical information of the parents is shared with somebody else without consent or permission being given, there must be protections around that.  We have engaged significantly with the Office of the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commission, and we have also spoken to mothers.  The mothers who spoke to the committee raised their concerns about their medical information being released.<\/p> <p>  The protections provided are that the information conveyed must be relevant to the adopted person's health, with the word \"relevant\" being interpreted broadly, and that the process will involve the information being given to the adopted person's medical practitioner.  I believe these two safeguards are necessary and will allow for the limitation of the privacy rights of the parent.  This is what we have been advised legally from a data protection position.  It also reflects the concerns about this particular point raised by the mothers who appeared before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I am not able to accept these amendments.

One of the key things in this regard, however, is what people might interpret as information &quot;relevant to health&quot;.  As Deputy Ward said, when I read this provision I see it as potentially restrictive.  The Minister, though, has said that he sees this as referring to the health of the person concerned and that he or she should be able to access all of his or her information.  Since the subject access request forms have been available, I have found that my constituents seeking information have achieved a good level of success with them.  I have encountered one or two cases, however, and I have contacted Ms McGarrigle a few times in this regard, where people have received documents where everything has been redacted.  I have come across people who had been looking for records for 40 years and got them and it was fantastic and great that they were able to get that information.  I have also met people, however, who were left much more frustrated when they got ten or 12 pages of information, but where only three or four lines were intelligible because so much was redacted.  In those cases, people tend to ponder what information exists about them because they wonder why so many pages have such little information.<\/p><p>I gave that example to show what can happen when something is potentially left open to interpretation and how one group of officials can respond to a request by deciding to agree to give all the information, while others can refuse and decide they do not believe the person making the request is entitled to the information being sought.  That is why we are so focused on the language of &quot;relevant to the health&quot; of a relevant or qualifying person and this is important.  It reads to me and others as if information may only be relevant if people know what they are looking for.  I refer to a situation where a person might potentially have a diagnosis of cancer or could be going for a battery of tests, but is not yet 100% sure of the prognosis.  It is for that reason that we are so focused on this aspect of the legislation.<\/p><p>The Minister might say something different about this phrasing, but I think it is still open to interpretation.  I do not want to go over everything we have said again, but this is why, similar to what Deputy Bacik said earlier, we believe the provision of information should not be restricted to it being &quot;relevant to the health&quot; of a relevant or qualifying person.  It is, unfortunately, open to interpretation and it would be possible to have very willing and accommodating officials, but, equally, other officials who might think very differently.  That is why we believe this is the opportunity to ensure that the legislation is strengthened in that regard.  If the Minister is of the same belief, I do not see why he could not accept some of the amendments in this grouping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#G01600","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":426,"content":"<p>As I read them, what this group of amendments is seeking to do is to remove the requirement to provide the relevant medical information to the relevant medical practitioner, who will then provide it to the relevant person.

This aspect is fundamentally important.  A later set of amendments seeks to limit the power to issue guidelines and I will be opposing those as well.  Guidelines are the manner in which we can see the achievement of the required consistency.<\/p> <p>  This set of amendments is concerned with deleting the second level of protection in respect of interference with the privacy rights of a parent.  The first level of protection is the provision that the information requested is relevant information about the adopted person's health and the second level protection is that the information is conveyed to the medical practitioner.  We have been advised that these are the necessary measures to balance the significant interference in the privacy rights of the parent.  It is worth repeating that we are giving the adopted person a legal right to access the medical information of another person, without that other person's consent.  It is a big step.

We wanted to make provision for that.  Issues are different when we are not dealing with adults and we engaged quite significantly.  In particular, we consulted with the Ombudsman for Children to ensure the appropriate provisions were put into the Bill and the section we are discussing here has been developed in consultation with the children's ombudsman.  The Ombudsman for Children has confirmed that the supportive meeting we are proposing in this Bill that allows for the release of information for those who are aged 16 and 17 is a necessary protection for younger people.<\/p> <p>  Under section 18 of the Bill, a person aged 16 or 17 seeking identity information will have that information released through a supportive meeting with the help of a suitably qualified person.  In addition, the applicant - the adopted person seeking the information - may be accompanied by a person of his or her choosing.  The meeting can take place in person or virtually as preferred.  This mechanism is designed to ensure there is an additional layer of support available to younger applicants and those who are not adults at the point of receiving and assimilating the information.  Given the clear opinion of the Ombudsman for Children on the provision, I will not accept an amendment that seeks to remove such a meeting.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 204 suggests that nobody in the meeting should try to influence the relevant person in any way with respect to his or her view on the adoption.  This language is very imprecise and it is unclear what constitutes influence.  It is defined in such a way that virtually any interaction between the younger person and the suitably qualified person could be construed as influence.  Again, matters relating to the conduct of these meetings can be dealt with through guidance and guidelines rather than through statutory provision.<\/p> <p>  A second element of amendment No. 204 requires that a person facilitating a supportive meeting should provide details of emotional or psychological supports upon request.  Again, that provision of support to relevant persons is already provided for under section 57 of the Bill.<\/p><p>We do not feel it necessary to repeat it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#J00800","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 203:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:   \t&ldquo;(2) Where the relevant person does not wish to have a meeting the records and provided items shall be provided to the relevant person via post or electronically.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#K00500","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 204:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(2) During the meeting referred to in <i>subsection (1)(a), <\/i>the designated person shall not try to influence the relevant person in any way in relation to the relevant person&rsquo;s views on their adoption.

This group of amendments removes the phrase &quot;to which the application relates only&quot; from the information that should be provided to relatives of deceased adopted people as this represents a restriction on the information provided.  For example, if a relative of a deceased adopted person has cancer and as a result had applied for a family medical history, according to the Bill only medical information relating to cancer will be given.  What if information in relating to heart disease or another medical condition is available on the file?  I believe I have discussed this already with the Minister and I am repeating myself.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 232 to 234, inclusive, concern the provision that only information that is relevant to the health of the relevant person will be released.  Amendment No. 233 removes the requirement for the information to be provided to the medical practitioner.  The Department's data protection impact assessment states that this measure is necessary in order to mitigate the risks of a genetic relative being identified.  However, as any identifying information will already have been removed, the requirement to release the information to a medical practitioner is completely unnecessary.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 235 ensures the location of all medical information that is available on file.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 236 ensures that a person with expertise in reading documents is involved in the process.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 240 and 241 widen the definition of a record by including that which relates to any relevant person and in section 2 the Bill defines a relevant person as someone who may apply to Tusla for information.

That is important in the context of making provision for what we want to achieve here, which is the release of information.  We get the release of this information but it is conditional on the medical history being relevant to the applicant's own medical history.

This originates in the understandable distrust adopted people and survivors have for State bodies.  They are seeking the assurance of as broad a definition as possible to prevent the lack of access they have been presented with for decades.  These amendments seek to insert such broader definitions.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 247 seeks to remove the entirely inappropriate and ambiguous term &quot;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&quot;.  We must call that phrase out as a get-out clause.  It is a worrying element of the Bill, which does not provide unfettered access, as everybody keeps claiming it does.  It is a barrier, plain and simple.  At a previous meeting, the Minister assured us that all of this Bill was carefully fine-tuned in accordance with engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General, which was integral to the Bill.  The phrase &quot;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&quot; is far from finely tuned and it is important to point that out.  I hope I am wrong but there is no doubt in my mind that such a phrase in the legislation will be used as an obstacle for people using their personal information.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 seek to remove another restrictive aspect of the Bill.  The amendments remove the option for the relevant body to provide what is essentially a summary or list of information and insist on the provision of the full range of records held about the applicant.  If this Bill is about enabling full and complete access, this is another section that needs changing.<\/p><p>Similarly, amendments Nos. 250 and 251 remove the relational statement &quot;a record of such class as the Minister may prescribe&quot; and replace it to provide for absolute statements that allow full access to records and personal data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#M01900","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":590,"content":"<p>This group of amendments relates to section 27 under Part 4.  That section provides for the release of the birth information of a child who died in an institution to a qualifying relative.  This speaks again to an issue that came up during the pre-legislative scrutiny process about information relating to children who died in institutions.  That was not provided for under the original draft that was recommended in the pre-legislative scrutiny and we are providing for that now.<\/p> <p>  Section 27 relates to birth information about children who died.  The amendment seeks to expand the definition of \"birth information\" to include the other categories but it is important to remember that those other categories are all covered by the next set of sections.  Sections 27 to 30, inclusive, provide for the release of birth information, early life information and care information, the successive types of information about children who died in institutions.  The type of information the amendment is seeking to insert into the section is addressed in subsequent sections and, therefore, we do not feel it needs to be repeated by including particular definitions in this section.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 relate to issues we have addressed previously.  We are looking for a statement to be released along with the documents explaining the documents as they are released.  The alternative that has been proposed in a number of places is the idea of a schedule.  We believe that the statement, which is not just a list, like a schedule, but actually gives some context to the documents being proposed, is a better way forward.  That is why on each occasion the issue comes up, we believe the provision of a statement alongside the release of documents is better than the provision of a schedule.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised concern about the use of the term \"to the extent that it is practicable to do so\".  That is a term of art in legislation.  It is intended to convey an obligation to provide copies of all records unless there is some significant obstacle to the provision of those particular records.  An example would be where an original record is lost.  We know there are situations where information will not be with Tusla or the AAI and that is going to be a difficulty when it comes to certain adopted people for whom there will be no information to provide them with because of historical circumstances.  <\/p> <p>  I will give the Deputy another example of the use of the term \"to the extent that it is practicable to do so\".  During the pandemic, electronic records were easily provided to people but hard copy records were not as accessible because people were not attending to collect them.  The SARs we have been issuing from our Department have meant the release of the electronic document which, for the commission's archive, is the vast majority of the information.  However, in answer to each SAR, the Department has stated it will also undertake a search of any physical documents that are in the commission archive.  It is in such a situation that \"to the extent that it is practicable to do so\" is used.  The core goal and intent behind this legislation is for the full release of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#M02000","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":591,"content":"<p>The Minister said the information around relevant bodies is covered in a subsequent section and that is great, if I take him at his word.

It is, in part, to respond to some of the recommendations of the special rapporteur's report on illegal birth registration and to give additional powers to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the set of amendments that have been proposed, the provisions of the Bill allow for a tracing service and provide a statutory underpinning for a tracing service, a statutory underpinning that has been missing up to this point.  It has meant that tracing is far more difficult for anybody, be it Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, to undertake.  First, it is important to say that by giving tracing a statutory underpinning we will significantly improve the ability of these bodies to engage with other State bodies.  Right now, GDPR is immediately used as a barrier to the exchange of information.  The statutory obligation to share information with Tusla and the AAI will facilitate the provision of this information.  It is also important to recognise that these are the bodies that have expertise and skill in tracing.  We are very clear that we want people to be able to get the benefit of a tracing service immediately.  It is important to say that these are the agencies with that level of expertise at present.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the specific amendments, we believe what is proposed in amendment No. 269 is already sufficiently provided for under this section.  In response to amendment No. 288, our view is that it is unnecessary as the guidelines are only relevant to the authority and agency in providing tracing services and they do not need to be expanded to include bodies from which the authority and agency can request information.  Those bodies do not have functions under this Part, only an obligation to comply with a request for information made in the context of a trace.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 274 is contrary to the policy intention of the legislation.  Section 33 is an important provision to cover a potential situation where people must be traced and contacted with important information.  To remove that reference could be detrimental should that situation arise.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 268 and 270, I cannot see the necessity for those amendments.  They would actually hinder the ability to provide a timely and efficient service.  Amendment No. 268 seeks to remove the ability to refer to the contact preference register in the provision of a tracing service by either the agency or the authority and it does not provide for an alternative process.  The decision to include this provision in the legislation was carefully considered.  The ability to check a contact preference on the contact preference register is a very important part of how the tracing service will operate.  First, in a scenario where a trace has been initiated and the preference for contact is found to be on the register, then it is possible to immediately and efficiently proceed to the facilitation of whatever level of contact has been proffered by both parties, including up to a reunion or a sharing of information.  It would avoid the need to go through a protracted tracing process if they can immediately refer to what is set out by parties on the contact preference register.  Second, in a situation where a trace has been initiated and the preference for no contact is found on the register, this information is conveyed to the person who requested the trace and the person can decide whether or not to proceed.  In both scenarios, by providing that the data on the register can be processed as part of the trace, the process is made more efficient.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 270 seeks to place restrictions on the manner in which the tracing service operates.  During the drafting process, my officials and I engaged with the organisations currently providing tracing services.<\/p><p>We requested their assistance in identifying the bodies from which information requests would be crucial to the provision of an effective and timely tracing service.  As far as we are aware, the current non-statutory tracing service encounters very significant difficulties, delays and obstructions in the provision of its service due to the fact it cannot request key information from other bodies such as those listed in this legislation.<\/p><p> The purpose of section 34 is to ensure the tracing service provided under this legislation can operate in the most efficient manner possible and, therefore, accepting this amendment would be contrary to that goal and it would undermine that particular intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#O02100","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I understand the need for the immediacy of this and the question of a different agency for information that is not Tusla.  The aim is not to slow the process for people getting information, and this is something we have discussed at great length in the committee.  When witnesses came before the committee we heard that people were not just traumatised by interactions with Tusla but really retraumatised as well.  There were stories of people sitting in front of social workers with their information in front of them, including birth name and the name of a mother and father.  This is information that people have wanted to know for their entire life but even though the staff could have several pieces of information, they would not tell these people any of it.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about this a lot because none of us wanted to delay the process of people accessing their information.  I request that the Minister and his Department give this consideration before the next Stage.  Something must change in the way Tusla interacts with people who have been affected.  Perhaps it could be a different department.  Could we give this some consideration before the next Stage because it is really important?

The need for that was made clear.  As Deputy Cairns said, the experience of Tusla of many of the witnesses who came before the committee was very negative.  I look again at our recommendations Nos. 56 and 57 in the pre-legislative scrutiny report, where we indicated the dissatisfaction in experiences with Tusla and the AAI, and the need to ensure improvements in resourcing, culture and legal structure.  There was also a recommendation that a new agency would carry out functions assigned and that interim arrangements would be made.  These amendments are proposed in that spirit and in recognition of what we heard at committee meetings.  The amendments deserve consideration.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has made a very significant indication that he will table amendments on Report Stage on the delivery of specialised placing services in the context of illegal birth registrations.  We probably all want a little more clarity on what those amendments would look like.  Is it envisaged, for example, that there would be any provision for a criminal investigation or is it much more about the tracing of the birth?  From the brave testimonies of people who have come forward and been the subject of illegal adoption, we are all conscious that the tracing in the context of these adoptions would be a much more difficult process because there were falsified records in some cases.  Attempts were made to cover up in others.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister outline exactly what will the specialised tracing look like at this stage?

I have also heard from and met people who were adopted and subject to illegal birth registration.  I have heard their very real and deep frustration with processes and how they were treated as individuals.  I am very aware of that.  I have said in these hearings on a number of occasions that we must change the culture in these organisations.  We will do this in a number of ways.<\/p> <p>  First, we must amend the law because the law does not facilitate the proper release of information.  That is why we are bringing forward this legislation and we believe it crucial in beginning that change.  We are bringing forward guidelines to ensure and copper-fasten that culture of release of information and the presumption of release.  That culture will be reinforced through the process of the implementation group led by my Department, ensuring alignment between our departmental review of the open release of information and that this is replicated across Tusla and the AAI.<\/p> <p>  This is also supported by resources.  We have discussed in the context of the budget an extra &euro;3 million for Tusla specifically to support the implementation of the information and tracing Bill this year and an extra &euro;1 million for the AAI, again to do that work.  Both of those bodies are hiring relevant staff and securing new expertise within their ranks to implement what is happening here.<\/p> <p>  there is also the provision in the legislation for a review of its operation.  It is entirely possible that in future a decision could be taken to entirely remove the provision of tracing from certain bodies.  The point I made in particular when we discussed this on Second Stage related to the suggestion of a creation of a new agency.  I know the recommendation was made in good faith by the committee but to attempt that now would delay the availability of the provisions in this legislation.<\/p> <p>  In changing the law and culture and by providing the resources, we can change the experience that adopted people have in terms of their engagement with Tusla.  I know the committee has had Mr. Bernard Gloster before it but I do not know if members discussed this particular point with him.  I regularly discuss this matter with Mr. Gloster both in the context of our quarterly meetings and, for various reasons, when I am on the phone to him regularly.  This is a core matter.  It may be useful for the committee to hear from him as chief executive on the work he is doing within the organisation to bring about this culture change.  I know many adopted people are not reassured and will not be reassured until they see change.  Perhaps it is the same for the committee.  It might be useful, rather than hearing it from me, to hear it directly from the chief executive.<\/p> <p>  I made a point regarding the tabling of an amendment on Report Stage and Deputy Bacik is correct.  Illegal birth registration is extremely hard to prove.  The reason is it is an illegal act and the person or persons perpetrating that act would have done their best to cover their tracks.  I do not know why but the people who engaged in this illegal act in St. Patrick's Guild did not cover their tracks but drew attention to the acts on the cover of the files by indicating adoption for birth.  That allowed the investigation to take place.<\/p> <p>  We will table an amendment that will expand section 33, allowing a Minister to request the review of files in certain circumstances.

However, the people for whom the register provides a service is already clearly outlined in section 38(3) and, as such, we feel this amendment has no material effect.<\/p> <p>  I also cannot accept amendment No. 290.  The objective of the amendment is to maintain the existing national contact preference register.  Again, we consider the amendment is unnecessary, as the transfer of the existing information that is on the existing register to the new contact preference register is already provided for in section 42.  Section 42 enables the existence of a single contact preference register once the existing data have been transferred and six months have elapsed after the date on which the section comes into operation.  Rather than creating no ambiguity, as was suggested, it would copper-fasten ambiguity, as we would have two contact preference registers in existence at the same time, so that would cause confusion, but it would also be a clear breach of the GDPR, in particular Article 25 on data protection by design and by default.  Article 25 is clear that unnecessary data should not be retained.  That is why we oppose the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#S01600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":733,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 290:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 37, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(a) safeguard and maintain existing registrations on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register,&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#S01800","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":736,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 291 to 294, inclusive, 296, 301 and 302 are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.

I reassure members that it is not the intention of the Bill to, and, more importantly, the Bill does not in any way, interfere with a person's right to apply for their information through a subject access request.  The Bill does contain a limited limitation of GDPR rights.  That is inherent in what we are trying to do here because the right of another party to not accept the processing of their information, which is provided for under GDPR at the moment, will not be available to people seeking to prevent the release of their information to an adopted person.  It is that limitation that is provided for.  If these amendments are accepted to say GDPR applies as normal at all times, it will undermine the very limited exception to GDPR that we have provided here, which ensures no one can prevent an adopted or boarded out person getting access to their information.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 327 relates to Part 9, which provides for an information campaign.  It relates to the right to access information and the right to rectification for mothers and fathers.  It is a response to my consultation with parents but particularly with mothers.  I know that some of that group also engaged with the committee.  The amendment will ensure that a mother or father's right to access information about themselves held by an institution and, importantly, the right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete information under GDPR is highlighted to them as part of the information campaign that will be run for three months on enactment of this legislation.  When I spoke to individuals they were not aware of some of the existing rights available to them under GDPR.  There was a particular concern if, say, derogatory comments or untrue information about the context of their pregnancy were placed on the file.

They may also have a different age by a matter of days, weeks or, indeed, months than that recorded on their incorrect birth registration.  As we know, as members of society, we are all often asked to complete a declaration when applying for services or engaging in contracts with both the State and private organisations.  This kind of declaration will also often ask the applicant to ensure the facts provided in the form are true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge.  Through consultation and engagement with those impacted by illegal birth registration, I understand that for some people this declaration now poses a challenge and causes discomfort given they know about their birth of origin.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 325 seeks to address this directly and is in line with the recommendations from the interdepartmental group on the St. Patrick's Guild incorrect birth registrations.  The amendment will provide assurance that contracts, legal documents and any acts undertaken in good faith will not be invalidated or that the persons affected will not experience any adverse consequences simply because they were the subject of an incorrect birth registration.  This assurance will apply both retrospectively and prospectively.  It does apply retrospectively, however, which is important; that is, prior to the passing of legislation and before the affected person discovered his or her birth was incorrectly registered.<\/p><p> I also intend to bring amendments on Report Stage to deal with the issue of succession in respect of persons affected by illegal birth registration.  This issue was raised by the interdepartmental group I established last year to address issues arising for people affected by illegal birth registration.  Since then, I have been liaising with the Minister for Justice on amendments to the Succession Act 1965, which falls within the competence of the Department of Justice.  These amendments will ensure that people affected by illegal birth registrations would, for the purposes of succession and inheritance, be deemed to be the children of their social parents.  It is proposed that the amendments will be carried in the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, again, so affected persons can benefit from them as quickly as possible.  That amendment will be brought forward on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#U04000","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's indication of those future amendments.

It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.

My colleagues, who are part of the Scottish Government delegation, and our colleagues, who are based in Dublin, are delighted to be here.  This is my first visit to Ireland in my official capacity as Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture.  While I am disappointed not be to be able to time my trip to watch the rugby, I am nonetheless delighted to be here and I look forward to many visits in the future.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is Scotland's closest European Union neighbour and we value the Scottish-Ireland relationship very highly.<\/p><p>Earlier this morning, I met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, to discuss the progress we have made together on the framework for our future co-operation and collaboration, namely, the Scotland-Ireland joint bilateral review.  Of course, we were meeting at a time when devastating war has broken out in Europe because of the outrageous actions of Russia's President Putin.  Scotland, like Ireland, is doing everything it can to support people in Ukraine at this dreadful time and these events are a reminder of the importance of the close collaboration between countries, which share common values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.<\/p><p> It is clear from the meeting we held earlier and the variety of work taking place across the full spectrum of the Scotland-Ireland relationship, that said relationship is in extremely good health.  Of course, it is great to have that formalised structure, but it is the vibrant people-to-people connections, familial ties and interwoven history that binds us so close together as people.<\/p><p> Turning now to Brexit, I will not need to remind anybody in this room, but it is worth stating just for the record that Scotland did not vote for Brexit.  We do not want it.  It is our intention to rejoin the EU as quickly as we are able to.  We very much see ourselves as a proudly European nation and that our future is within the EU as an independent country.  We were inside the EU for 47 years, share the EU&rsquo;s values and believe we have much to contribute.<\/p><p> It is clear that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement marks a significant step backwards from our trading position within the EU, and that view is shared by the Scottish people.  We know through polling that 75% of people in Scotland have a negative opinion about whether the UK has benefited from Brexit and only 2% of people in Scotland believe that Boris Johnson delivered a good Brexit deal.  In this respect, regardless of constitutional circumstances, the Scottish Government will always be a supporter of efforts aimed at greater co-operation between the UK and the EU, and that close co-operation is in all our interests.<\/p><p> Scottish independence is, of course, a matter for the people of Scotland.  Following the election in May of last year there is now a substantial majority in the Scottish Parliament in favour of an independence referendum.  The Scottish Government is working to ensure that a legitimate and constitutional referendum can be held within this parliamentary term, and, if the Covid crisis is over, within the first half of the term.  However, again, regardless of the constitutional settlement, the Scottish Government will always be a voice for the warmest possible relationship and partnership between the peoples of Scotland, the rest of the UK and Ireland.  It was very good to be able to discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the links and areas where we are focusing our efforts, such as the on economy, health, culture and a number of other concrete areas that will matter to all of members' constituents, no matter which part of Ireland they represent.<\/p><p> On that note, I will finish my remarks.  I look forward to our discussion and answering any questions that members have.  I look forward to the ongoing positive relations that we have between Scotland and Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angus Robertson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":940,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Robertson.

It is wonderful to have the Cabinet Secretary in person.  It is wonderful to have anyone here in person, but particularly Mr. Robertson after the past couple of years.  Those of us who were in the previous Oireachtas had a very good relationship with his predecessors across a multitude of roles, both Mr. Mike Russell and Ms Fiona Hyslop, who, I know, play a different but continuing role in Scottish politics.<\/p> <p>  I want to go straight into four key questions leading on from Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s remarks.  The first two are specifically kind of Brexit-related issues.  From engagements we had with his predecessors, it was obvious that there was a clear disconnect between the Westminster Government and the devolved administrations.  Much of this was happening at the time when the Northern Ireland Executive had collapsed and Stormont was not in position, but there was also an inability on the part of the Scottish and Welsh Governments to influence the decisions is one area but, more importantly, to influence the implementation of decisions and deal with the practicalities.  Could Mr. Robertson give, if possible, a brief synopsis of where that relationship stands in terms of London working with Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast?<\/p> <p>  The second aspect, which is also in respect of Brexit, relates to the practical implications of the protocol for Scottish ports and what sort of effect it has had.  We can go into the macro issues of trading impacts and relationships, but I am interested in terms of actual responsibilities, such as the levels of traffic and things like that.  We have obviously seen a drastic increase in direct shipping from this island to the Continent.  Traffic across the land bridge, through Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke, has fallen dramatically.<\/p> <p>  Moving away from Brexit for once but tied absolutely to it, I am very intrigued about Scottish Government policy and where it may differ from overall UK Government policy.  Pressing and timely, and Mr. Robertson referred to this, is the reception of refugees fleeing Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.  What is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on how it will receive refugees fleeing conflict?  How it will work with partners across the UK and with the EU, particularly Ireland?  Questions were raised off the record by British ministers in relation to the impact of the common travel area in this regard.  Those questions were misplaced.  Scotland, like Ireland, has a very strong reputation as being a welcoming country.  Huge efforts were made after the Brexit referendum by the Scottish Government, I believe by Ben Macpherson, Jenny Gilruth and other ministers, to specifically state to EU citizens that they are welcome.  However, I am particularly concerned with the Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict.  In the main, these are women and children.  How does the Scottish Government view its role in this regard?  Is it different from that of the London Government?<\/p> <p>  My final question also relates to the crisis in Ukraine.  There has been much discussion of the possibility of fast-tracking Ukrainian accession to the EU.  We had a lengthy discussion in private session, and the matter is not that straightforward.  I wish to kind of play the hypothetical card.  I think Mr. Robertson is game for it, but he can say if he is not.  He mentioned that Scotland&rsquo;s future constitutional discussion is a matter for the Scottish people.  We in Ireland wholly recognise that it is not our discussion to get involved in.  However, to what extent has Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s Department looked at the Copenhagen criteria?  Is it a matter of fact that it is his political desire as opposed to his ministerial desire to achieve Scottish independence?  Accession to the EU would play a big part in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#F00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":942,"content":"<p>I could probably talk for the rest of the session, which I will not do, in answering Deputy Richmond&rsquo;s timely questions, as he covered quite a lot of ground there.  I hope I do them justice.  The Deputy can feel free to come back if I do not touch on some of the points.<\/p> <p>  First, on the intergovernmental relations side of things, notwithstanding the fact that we have a profoundly differently view on the future relations that we foresee in Great Britain, we are very keen to work, wherever we can, with the UK Government, but also with colleagues in Northern Ireland and Wales, on practical co-operation.  To give an insight into that, I have been a member of the Scottish Government since last May.  We do much of our traffic online, and I have been involved in numerous calls with UK Government ministers and with Northern Irish and Welsh colleagues to discuss the four-nations approach to any number of things.  Where those have worked well has been the exception rather than the rule.  I have one particularly good example, which I use repeatedly because I am a glass-half-full kind of person, to highlight where it has worked very well with the then Cabinet Minister Chloe Smith from the UK Government to try to get what are called the framework agreements, which are the post-Brexit arrangements for how we are trying to manage our post-Brexit realities in a better way.  In some respects it helps because, as somebody who has spent a long time - 16 years - as a member of the UK Parliament, I know many of my UK Government interlocutors.  As one can imagine, when one has a good working relationship with people, one can get things in a better a place if one is minded to do so.<\/p><p>Let me start with that as the good news.  That was an example where we could meet and we were both committed to ensuring we could try to get things in a better place.<br\/><br\/>However, as a general rule, meetings that take place are perfunctory box-ticking operations initiated by UK Government Departments to say they have &quot;consulted&quot; Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland rather than working with us on developing policy and listening to suggestions.  Invitations often come at next to no notice.  I was messaged one Friday to say the UK Attorney General wanted to meet with the Scottish and Welsh Governments and colleagues from Northern Ireland and we literally had no idea what it was about.  Our officials had no idea what it was about.  We arrived to be told what the UK Government intended to do in relation to dealing with legacy EU legislation.  These are things that matter and they matter to us greatly because, jumping forward to one of Deputy Richmond's next questions, where there is a difference of policy we in Scotland are doing our best to remain aligned with the EU and EU legislation.  Notwithstanding the fact we are outside the EU, we are ensuring legislation in Scotland remains as closely aligned as possible for very obvious reasons so when we rejoin - and this jumps forward again to another of the Deputy's questions - EU colleagues will know that not only do we have the 47 years behind us of fulfilling the <i>acquis communitaire<\/i>and the standards of membership of the EU but even during Brexit we were doing our level best to remain aligned.<br\/><br\/>In answer to the Deputy's question, intergovernmental relations on a technical and working level are, frankly, not good.  I have officials who join me here who will no doubt be able to say on a technical level the civil service-to-civil service relations can be very good and very positive and we certainly want to operate in that way.  However, sometimes when things get to a political level, there is not a willingness to operate in a respectful way.  This has led to a change in the working architecture between the UK Government and devolved administrations.  This is publicly available information if members are interested in seeing how all this is supposed to work.  In theory, you would have to hope the machinery will work better than it has up to now but frankly, if the political willingness is not there to have a respectful approach to colleagues in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast then it is not going to improve things.  Something that will no doubt be of interest to all members of the committee is often you find yourself in meetings where you find the same point of view is being represented by SNP ministers, Welsh Labour Party ministers and ministers from Northern Ireland, who often appear in twos at meetings.  I can be in meetings with colleagues from Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party and we are all in agreement.  That shows how unfortunately often intergovernmental relations in the UK are suboptimal.  It is a shame but we are committed to trying to make that work better.<br\/><br\/>Moving to the Deputy's second point, he asked about the practical implications of the protocol for ports.  Obviously, there has been a change in the nature of Irish direct freight traffic in particular wanting to get straight into the European market from one part of the Single Market to another and not have to transit the UK that is not part of the Single Market, with all the challenges that brings.  That is not our situation because we are now outside the EU.  We have not had that kind of change in trade patterns, although I can easily see that happening after we rejoin the EU because the advantages of that are pretty clear.  The advantages of that are, incidentally, also understood on the Continent.  We recently had a visit by the premier of Flanders, who made the point publicly in Scotland that he thought Antwerp would be a tremendously good port for Scottish freight traffic to use more after we rejoin the EU.  I am sure it will not be the only opportunity we have and we must look and understand how all that would work.  On the negative aspect of things, we are facing the prospect of having border arrangements at Cairnryan for port traffic between Northern Ireland and Scotland.  That is of course related to the protocol and what is emanating from the Brexit process.  Notwithstanding the challenges we know are associated with all that at the present time, we are working to try to make things work as best they can because in some respects this is actually devolved.  Agriculture, for example, is a devolved issue.  Again, we will try our best to make things work as well as they can.<br\/><br\/>The third question was on Scottish Government's policy divergence from the rest of the UK on the specific issue of refugees.  We take the same policy approach as the Irish Government and the rest of the EU, namely, that the worst refugee crisis in Europe since the end of the Second World War behoves us all to act in different ways.  The fact that the Irish Government and its EU colleagues have waived any visa requirements that may have previously existed is, to our mind, exactly the right response to take.  The UK's administrative approach, whereby it is effectively using immigration hurdles to deal with refugees in their hour of need, is wrong-headed in our view.  We can look at the number of people who have been taken in.  From memory, at the start of this week Ireland had already taken in 1,923 refugees, and I know it is now more than that, while the UK had taken in 50.  It had issued visas to 50 people.  I find it shaming and appalling.  I have been very vocal on the issue because we need to do more.  I speak as the son of a refugee.  Think about this for a second - the United Kingdom was taking in refugees from Germany after the war in 1946 and 1947.  It was a big-hearted response.  The UK was absolutely right then and is wrong now.  It would be good for people to remember the history of a better Britain in dealing with refugees.  We have much to learn from Ireland because we will see greater refugee numbers through the suboptimal schemes the UK Government has introduced.  We are very keen to learn about the experience here.  I was interested to hear that among the early arrivals, the overwhelming majority are people who are being taken into the private accommodation of relatives and friends, so it is a quite a different refugee picture from that we have experienced in recent years in Scotland with people coming from Afghanistan or Syria, for example.  We have much to learn.  Incidentally, Ukrainian refugees are arriving in Scotland from Northern Ireland, which is a good thing because we have a part to play in helping our fellow Europeans in need.  We take much the same attitude in terms of our values towards refugees as you do and we want to do as much as we can.  We will try to persuade the UK Government to reform their approach to the arrival of Ukrainians.<br\/><br\/>On the specific question of the fast-tracking of Ukrainian EU membership, I completely understand the benefit of sending a signal that there is a European future for Ukraine and incidentally also for Moldova and Georgia, which have similarly asked that consideration be given to their accession.  Having spent ten years on the European committee of the UK Parliament, it is an area I know a bit about and in a previous life as a journalist I covered the accession processes of the mid-1990s.  We all know that joining the EU brings with it all kinds of requirements.<\/p><p>We must do anything we can to help the Ukrainians after they emerge from this horrific war and after, hopefully, they win by resisting the Russian invasion.  They will need a lot of help in terms of economic preparation, rule of law and the institutional standards that are required by EU member states.  I totally understand and applaud the signal that is being sent to the people in Ukraine that they have a European perspective.  I agree with that.  I wish us to be as helpful as we can in helping people in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia do everything they need to in order to ready themselves for EU membership in a post-war environment.  There is potential for unforeseen consequences no one would wish to see, such as negative impacts on the economy and so on.  I agree with the point about the perspective.  We should help Ukraine join the EU in the speediest possible timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angus Robertson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":945,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Robertson for those comprehensive responses.

That probably makes it difficult for them as they consider where to go.  Has Mr. Robertson had any major interaction with the British Government about the notion that has come out of the Home Office about security and that Ireland is a security risk because of the common travel area?  The British have suggested they do not know who is coming in and out although I see that as an excuse.<\/p> <p>  The word Mr. Robertson used most often in connection with the British Government was \"suboptimal\".  I imagine Mr. Robertson will tell the committee that consultation is tick-box consultation at best.  There has been some anecdotal evidence but perhaps Mr. Robertson would like to give some details about the negative impacts that Scotland is already suffering as a result of Brexit, which was a subject he touched on.  Mr. Robertson was not clear earlier.  Perhaps he would like to reiterate his position on Scotland's long-term positioning.  It is a question for Scottish representatives and not Irish representatives but Scotland has a particular project in place.  Does it have a strategy and a timeline?  If Mr. Robertson would go into whatever detail he can in that regard, I would appreciate it.  As much as it is an issue for the Scottish, I would not shed any tears for any damage done to the union.  That is unlikely to come as a shock to anyone.  Perhaps Mr. Robertson would also share some minor details of the framework discussions he had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#H00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I should say first that I have a long-standing interest in this area.  I served for a number of years on the intelligence and security committee, which involves Members of both Houses of the British Parliament and which oversees the UK intelligence services.  I have a very close interest in the area and a reasonably deep understanding of the work that these agencies do in the UK and internationally to keep us safe.  It is largely women and children who are coming from Ukraine and I do not think they pose any security threat whatsoever.  That is my first observation.  My second relates to bad people who want to do harm in the UK.  We have experience of such people coming from Russia, as was the case in Salisbury and in the attempted and, sadly, successful poisoning of others.  That shows that the Russians do not need a refugee crisis to get into the UK.  I make those two points.  Speaking frankly, I view the arguments of the British Government as excuses to manage and limit the arrival of refugees.  Do I think it is a sensible thing that our security and police services do everything that is proportionate and sensible to make sure that we are aware of who is arriving?  I absolutely do.  However, if that is required, it should be done once people have arrived.  We should attain standard information about who is arriving in the country but we need to do it the other way around.  To answer the Deputy's question in short form, I do not see that there are major security implications or different security implications from those that previously existed.  Incidentally, if that were a particular issue for the United Kingdom, it must surely also be a particular challenge for European Union countries.  The exceptionalism we often hear about from Ministers in London is beyond me.  I have every faith that Ireland's policing service and the policing and border services in other European Union states will be doing what they need to do to ensure that states know who is arriving into their countries.  That is right and proper but in the UK's case, it is being used as an excuse to use an administrative system to limit the arrival of refugees.  That is my answer to the Deputy's first question.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about our longer term positioning.  It is not very long term.  We were elected last year with a majority in the Scottish Parliament.  We believe the people should be able to decide our constitutional future.  The Scottish Government has been elected with that mandate and it is our intention to deliver on it and ensure that the people can decide on our constitutional future in a democratic referendum.  The UK still views itself as a voluntary union and because of that, we have an inherent right to decide the arrangements we wish to see.  We want to see improved relations on our islands and we believe that becoming a sovereign state, working together with friends and neighbours in the rest of the current United Kingdom, who will be our closest political and economic partners, and our friends in Ireland and Northern Ireland, is important in that regard.  It is important to understand Scottish independence in that context.  We believe we will have a better future by becoming an independent state.  It behoves us to think about what we can do to ensure we have the appropriate architecture on these islands to allow us work together better.  Of course, we have the British-Irish Council, which brings together the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland while also including colleagues from Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.  That is a good start and there is much more we can do to develop that as an architecture to bring us together.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the timeline.  We were elected last year.  We said that we wished to have a referendum after we emerged from the pandemic and, thankfully, we are all now emerging from the pandemic.  We are in the process of making the necessary preparations within the Government to be able to hold a referendum, which would take place towards the end of 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angus Robertson"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":950,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Robertson explain the triggering mechanism in that regard?

We have been elected as a government, we have a mandate to hold a referendum and we intend to hold a referendum as we did previously.  If there are to be any changes, that would be from the UK Government that would disrespect a democratic election result and that would recast the United Kingdom as the kind of state that it would then be - one that would deny democratic election results and overturn a precedent that was set by a previous and incidentally Conservative Government.

I welcome Mr. Robertson.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to interact with him.<\/p> <p>  I want to make one point on Ukraine before I ask two other questions.  My question on Ukraine may not be for Mr. Robertson because it is obviously a British Home Office matter.  There is concern here that a number of refugees - people fleeing from terror in Ukraine who want to come to the United Kingdom because they have family members in the United Kingdom - cannot get access right now.  Some are coming to Ireland.  I had contact in my office in Wexford this week with a mother and daughter who decided to come to Ireland and apply to access the UK from here.  I am wondering if there is any help Mr. Robertson can give to ensure that if there are people with direct family connections in the United Kingdom who, for practical reasons, are fleeing terror, want to escape and find it more convenient to come to Ireland, they would have their visas processed quickly here.<\/p> <p>  On the trade distortions post Brexit, I chair the economics committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and we are doing a report on the trade changes post Brexit on these islands.  We are taking evidence on the island of Ireland and we intend to go to the UK side to take evidence there as well before preparing our report.  I represent the constituency of Wexford where the port of Rosslare has seen an increase of more than 300% in direct continental traffic since Brexit.  More and more freight operators are not using the land bridge but travelling directly to the Continent.  That practice will increase with a new service regularly being added to an already burgeoning set of services.<\/p> <p>  This question may fall under the category of questions Mr. Robertson cannot answer.  We are trying to get a handle on the operation of the protocol in Northern Ireland and its implications for trade there.  Would that be the model the Scottish Government would seek to achieve, that is, continued membership of both markets post independence?<\/p><p>My third question relates to energy co-operation, which has probably accelerated in the last week, never mind in the last couple of months.  There is an enormous focus on decarbonisation, which has accelerated.  Frans Timmermans's declaration yesterday has underscored that for the European Union.  Offshore wind will be a huge resource for these islands with regard to decarbonisation.  Has the Scottish Government any practical engagement with the Irish Government to co-operate on the development and servicing of offshore wind?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#J00800","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":962,"content":"<p>There is lots of ground that I could cover.  Those are excellent questions and I will try to do them all justice.  On co-operation between the Scottish Government and the UK Government on new schemes for Ukrainian refugees, we are in active contact to try to ensure we have the best possible system in place under the parameters of this suboptimal approach taken by the UK Home Office.  Visa processing in Ireland will form part of the picture.  As I mentioned to the committee already, we are seeing people arrive in Scotland from Northern Ireland.  I do not have information in front of me about whether these people had flown directly to Belfast, but I suspect they had flown to Dublin.  We need to understand all of that much better.  We need to do anything we can to make the suboptimal system work better and to help people in their hour of need.  If there is co-operation that we can pursue with Irish colleagues and through the UK diplomatic network, with the visa application process, that is definitely something to look at to make sure things are working as well as they possibly can.<\/p> <p>  On the Northern Ireland protocol, we are all invested in trying to find workable solutions to the challenge.  We did not wish and I do not think members wished to see the UK leave the European Union.  It is problematic for the UK to have entered into international agreements which it then seeks to change unilaterally.  We have been a strong voice in a UK context in trying to impress on UK Government colleagues how important it is that the UK upholds international law and agreements that have been reached in good faith.  We will try to be a voice of reason in that.  There is not a direct read-across from Northern Ireland's situation to Scotland, for reasons that we do not have long enough to go into at this session.  They should be obvious to everybody.  I leave the committee with the assurance that we will do everything we can to make sure we have solutions to the problems that have emerged in Northern Ireland and are continuing to emerge, with a ripple effect on good governance.  We want to be as helpful as we can.<\/p> <p>  Regarding energy co-operation, Scotland is fortunate in that it has won the natural resource lottery twice.  Not many countries can say that.  We were the single biggest oil producer in the European Union, not that Scotland saw the great tax benefits that her majesty's treasury has enjoyed for decades.  Notwithstanding that and the fact that we need to pivot away from our dependence on hydrocarbons, we have the good fortune that we have amazing renewable energy potential, which is our second lottery win.  I think we have 25% of Europe's wind energy capacity.  That does not get into other sources of renewable energy, which we also have, including water, waves or tides.  Ireland is not short of those either.  The Deputy is right to underline the potential for co-operation between Scotland and Ireland.  I know colleagues in government who are responsible for these areas are interested in making sure we pursue all of those things.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that Covid has been a big challenge for everybody, in my bilateral meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, earlier today, we reflected on the successful delivery across the range of areas that we want to work together on.  Technology, economy and energy form part of that.  There is undoubtedly more that we can do.  Let us have the ambition to do that.  I would welcome us doing more together in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angus Robertson"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I welcome our distinguished guests.  In the fullness of time, history will judge the fall-out from and assess Brexit.  While we did not wish for Brexit, would it be widely accepted that an unintended consequence of Brexit is to strengthen the case for Scottish independence, as I believe it does for reunification of this island?  Maybe we should not waste an opportunity to move forward that agenda for somebody who advocates Scottish independence.<\/p><p>The best of both worlds includes access to the Single Market and the internal market.  I believe that is a way forward, through the teething process.  Would it be true to say that Scotland would be envious of the best of both worlds and the protocol and that it would like something similar?  Is the only reason Northern Ireland secured that not that it was a recognition of a vote in what unionists might regard as a region of a country, but rather that it was underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement, which Scotland cannot rely on?  Are the witnesses still actively seeking it as an interim protocol arrangement?  I am interested in preparations for EU membership for post-independence Scotland.  Are the witnesses doing anything to comply voluntarily with EU regulations so that they are ahead of the field on flora, fauna and habitats directives?  That would be smart.<\/p><p>I would like to see them win the referendum this time, as I would like to see it won in Ireland.  Despite passionately wanting to see that, I am realistic about it.  Have the witnesses more than token representation in London this time?  I am not saying that Scotland should receive dominion status.  This applies equally for our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland.  Should we not have a beefed-up infrastructure from east to west, with a gathering of our friends in all these countries?  That might win over, and allay the fears of, people of a unionist bent in Scotland or Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Being a realist, I know the procedure required for a referendum on this island.  Can the Prime Minister not stymie the witnesses in proceeding with that referendum?  If they go ahead without the Prime Minister's<i>imprimatur<\/i>, will it be regarded as an invalid referendum?  He does not seem to wish to have it any time soon, although reference has been made today to 2023.  I wish the witnesses well in that regard.  How do they overcome the current Prime Minister's lack of enthusiasm, to put it mildly, about holding a referendum for Scotland?  It is fantastic that the witnesses are here and we look forward to closer relations with our Celtic cousins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#K00300","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646784000,"counter":964,"content":"<p>That is great and I thank the Senator very much.

I will try to cover some of the ground of the Senator's questions.  A point was made about complying with European regulations and that is the alignment point I made earlier.  We are remaining aligned and using a number of different ways to do it so that when it comes to a point where we have conversations at the appropriate stage with the Commission about our membership, we will be able to show that we have effectively remained aligned with the European Union, its regulations and so on.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of where Scotland now finds itself as an unintended consequence of Brexit.  We certainly did not wish to leave the European Union along with the rest of the United Kingdom but it is being forced on us.  We do what we must to ensure we can be in the best possible position.  There was a question about our representation in the rest of the UK.  We are very fortunate to have an excellent Scottish Government representational office in London with very esteemed leadership.  Some of the members may know Mr. John Webster, who was the head of Scotland House in Dublin, and he has now moved on to head our representative office in London.  He has been replaced here by my colleague, Ms Katy McNeil, whom members will see more of attending various meetings in this place and in public life in Dublin and Ireland more generally.  We try to have the best possible relations, both in London and Dublin.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on thinking about administrative architecture that brings together all of us in what I still call the home nations.  I say that as a rugby fan but why would I not say it with everything else?  I feel very at home here, as I do elsewhere on these islands.  It behoves us to think about how we can give people assurance and reassurance that regardless of our views on constitutional arrangements, there is a place for all of us and all our traditions in an improved constitutional situation in Scotland and elsewhere on these islands.<\/p> <p>  I have already mentioned the British-Irish Council, the secretariat of which is based in Edinburgh.  We look with great interest at what our colleagues in Scandinavia do to bring those nations together to work co-operatively but we will have to find our own way.  I am very much in favour of that and it is over to committee to get its ideas.  I am very interested in hearing about all that.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also commented on the British Prime Minister wishing to stymie things.  Scottish political history is full of UK political leaders saying \"no, no, no, no, no, yes\".  We do not have enough time to go into all of this but at some point the penny will drop for decision makers in Westminster that if one is going to block democracy and a democratic decision to be able to decide on our constitutional future, it would not be a decision without consequence.  It would profoundly change the nature of the United Kingdom and the view internationally of the United Kingdom as a democratic state, or how it might not be acting as a democratic state.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to ensure our experience in the run-up to the 2014 referendum is the one we seek to emulate.  It was workable, deliverable and respected.  If it was good enough then, it is good enough now.  It is exactly what we intend to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022030900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angus Robertson"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":967,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Robertson for his insight and wisdom.

We are delighted that is working so well.<\/p> <p>  It is also very advantageous for the preparations we are making for the referendum.  Their perspectives are not all the same.  We have different policies on a number of different issues, which underlines an important point.  Independence is not just there for one party or one vision of an independent state.  Becoming an independent state means it can change to become the image of different political parties and priorities, which is a thoroughly good thing.  It is what is done here.  Our partnership working with the Green Party is new for us and for it.  It is working very well.  It is good to be able to put that on record.<\/p> <p>  The mechanisms from 2014 are the mechanisms to be used.  We have a precedent and it is exactly what we intend to follow.  I have gone through it already so I will not go through it again.  We have a precedent and it worked then.  This does not need to be complicated.  It is very important for us that we have an agreed, recognised and constitutional process.  It is important for us in the UK and it is important for the European Union and EU member states.  The level of interest across the European Union for where Scotland finds itself in our ambitions to rejoin the European Union is extremely high.  Across the political spectrum we are seeing incredible empathy for the situation in which we find ourselves, having been taken out of the European Union against our will.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to us working as good neighbours and friends and as member states of the European Union, helping and supporting one another, especially in times of need, like those seen currently in Ukraine.

Perhaps in time we will be able to inspire them to rethink their relationship with the European Union.<\/p> <p>  I will finish on one fact, which it may be helpful for friends in Westminster to remember.  If Ireland and Scotland's economies are counted together, we are England's biggest trading partner.  We look forward to working with our friends from the rest of these islands.

Many individuals struggle with this at an individual level in terms of what they can do to help.<\/p> <p>  Not to bring football into it but the World Cup is as symbolic a competition as one could get in the sporting world.  Three more countries from Europe will compete to qualify for the remaining places, including Mr. Robertson's country.  The Scottish FA has been very generous in facilitating and trying to postpone the match.  I will not ask Mr. Robertson for his opinion because I do not want him to get into bother with his Scottish authority.<\/p> <p>  I am not talking on behalf of anybody other than myself.  My opinion is that FIFA should look at symbolically facilitating Ukraine in order that it does not have to go through the process of a semi-final and a final and even at postponing the match until June.  As Mr. Robertson said, this will be long term.  Half of the FC Dynamo Kyiv footballers are fighting today in the trenches.<\/p><p>Footballers are fighting in the trenches.  People have died since this meeting started.  There could be a symbolic gesture like that, without being a detriment to Scotland, Wales or any other country that is trying to qualify.  Maybe FIFA should in some way facilitate Ukraine to play in Qatar without having to go through a semi-final and a final.  It has paid a lot and more than earned its place at this stage.  I know a former First Minister, Henry McLeish, spoke on this issue.  He was referred to by <i>The Scotsman <\/i>on Monday.  That is a personal opinion.<br\/><br\/>Gu&iacute;m gach rath ar na finn&eacute;ithe amach anseo.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh Angus Robertson aon am.  T&aacute; an doras oscailte.

If there are other related, broader questions on these Estimates, I am also happy to try to deal with them because it will be an opportunity to deal with a range of matters across the defence sector.<\/p><p>I welcome this opportunity to engage with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to consider the 2022 Revised Estimates for Vote 35 - Army Pensions, and Vote 36 - Defence.  I have a short opening statement that sets out the overall position and updates members on some recent developments within the defence sector.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was recently published and I express my thanks to the chair and all members of the commission for their time and effort spent producing this report.  Following its publication last month, I had some very positive and constructive discussions on a wide range of matters relating to the report.  The report is forthright in its assessment of the current status of the Defence Forces and highlights key issues that must be tackled, including cultural change.  The report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland that we as a society must carefully consider and respond to.  This report, and recent events, have fostered real interest and debate about defence matters and I look forward to further exploration and discussion on these issues in the period ahead.<\/p><p> The defence sector is comprised of two Votes: Vote 35 - Army Pensions, which members will see from the briefing is straightforward this year, and Vote 36, which is the broader Defence Vote.  The high-level goal of both Votes is to \"provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government\".  Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.  The combined Estimates for Defence and Army Pensions for 2022 provide for gross expenditure of over &euro;1.1 billion, an increase of over &euro;35 million, or 3%, over 2021.  The 2022 provision comprises of some &euro;836 million for Vote 36, an increase of &euro;27 million on 2021, and some &euro;271 million for Vote 35 - Army Pensions, an increase of some &euro;8 million.<\/p><p> The Army Pensions Vote has a single programme entitled, \"Provision for Defence Forces&rsquo; Pensions Benefits\".  It makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to, or in respect of, former members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.  The 2022 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;271 million for the Army Pensions Vote, of which some &euro;261 million covers expenditure on superannuation benefits.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.<\/p><p> During 2021, some 300 members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, retired on pension.  There are currently some 12,890 pensioners paid from the Army Pensions Vote and their numbers continue to rise, year on year.  Against that backdrop, I am pleased to inform the committee that the increased allocation provided in 2022 will cover both the cost of existing and new pensions, as well as the passing on of benefits from pay increases received by serving personnel.<\/p><p> Turning to Vote 36 - Defence, this is delivered under a single programme entitled \"Defence Policy and Support, Military Capabilities and Operational Outputs\".  The Revised Defence Estimate of some &euro;836 million for 2022 includes an allocation of over &euro;545 million for the pay and allowances of members of the Permanent Defence Force, civil servants and civilian employees.  It also provides for commitments arising from the Building Momentum 2021-2022 public service pay agreement.  The non-pay allocation comprises both current and capital elements, and the Revised Defence Estimate provides a non-pay current expenditure allocation of over &euro;150 million for 2022.  This allocation provides mainly for expenditure on ongoing and essential Defence Forces standing and operational costs, such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.<\/p><p> The principal demand drivers of defence capital funding are the ongoing renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment, along with the development of military infrastructure and information and communication technologies.  The White Paper on Defence, updated in 2019, highlighted the importance of capability development and the necessity for continued renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment and infrastructure.  To this end, the national development plan has allocated multi-annual funding of &euro;566 million to defence out to 2025, with an allocation of &euro;141 million provided for 2022.  Many of the defence equipment projects are complex, multi-annual and have long lead-in times, so the funding certainty now provided by the national development plan is welcome as it will enable the Department and the Defence Forces to plan, prioritise and deliver on scheduled projects over the coming years.<\/p><p> The acquisition of military equipment is pursued through the defence equipment development plan, a plan based on White Paper objectives, which provides a consolidated, structured basis for ongoing investment in military equipment to maintain and develop necessary capabilities.  Among the major defence equipment upgrade and replacement programmes set to be prioritised over the coming years are: the land forces capability development and force protection programmes, including an upgrade of the military transport fleet and next-generation radio communications and signal equipment; the ongoing Naval Service vessel renewal and replacement programme, which includes the mid-life refit of the P50 class of naval vessel and the progression of the multi-role vessel project, which is very important; and the ongoing Air Corps aircraft renewal and replacement programme, which includes the purchase of the CASA C295 maritime patrol aircraft, which is due next year.  In addition to these major projects, an ongoing schedule of capital investment across a broad range of force protection, transport, communications and information technology, weapons and ammunition systems continues in 2022.  This level of investment in defence equipment platforms will further boost ongoing efforts at modernising and upgrading defence equipment platforms through land, sea and air domains.<\/p><p> The capital allocation for defence infrastructural projects for 2022 is &euro;35 million, the highest allocation since the economic crash in 2008.  This will allow significant investment under the Defence Forces built infrastructure programme, including: the provision of a new cadet school at the Defence Forces Training College at the Curragh, County Kildare; the provision of a new military medical facility for the Defence Forces at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel; and the upgrade to accommodation facilities in various military locations throughout the country, such as Collins Barracks, Cork, McKee Barracks, Dublin, and the Naval Base, Haulbowline.  This level of infrastructure investment, which has a strong regional or local dividend in terms of local enterprise and employment, seeks to ensure that all Defence Forces installations are fit for purpose, taking account of operational, security and health and safety considerations.  However, it will take time and a programme of continuous investment to bring all Defence Forces facilities up to the modern standards that we desire.<\/p><p> The White Paper on Defence has identified that demands on future capability will need to take account of climate change objectives.  In that regard, defence remains fully committed to incorporating green procurement practices into all defence organisation equipment and infrastructural procurements in line with overarching climate action plan objectives.<\/p><p> I would like to briefly reference some of the many outputs to be delivered by the Defence Forces from the Defence Vote throughout this year.  The 2022 allocation will allow Defence Forces personnel to meet Government commitments on our overseas peace support missions and proudly represent Ireland abroad in diverse, often challenging, locations throughout the world.  As of 1 March, there were 569 PDF personnel serving in nine overseas missions throughout the world.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to international peace and security and I thank our Defence Forces for their professionalism and commitment to their overseas roles.  At home, the funding provision allows the Defence Forces to continue to provide essential support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as requested, across various roles such as explosive ordnance disposal call-outs, Garda air support missions and Naval Service diving operations.  It also enables the Defence Forces, as part of their aid to the civil authority role, to provide support to local authorities and the Health Service Executive in their emergency response efforts.<\/p><p> At this point, I believe it is opportune to highlight the collective defence response to the Covid-19 pandemic over the last two years, which involved Permanent Defence Force personnel, members of the Reserve, Civil Defence volunteers and civil servants and civilian employees within my Department.  I thank all of them for their resilience and support throughout what was a very difficult period for everybody.<\/p><p> The Defence Vote provides funding of over &euro;5 million for Civil Defence in 2022.  This funding supports Civil Defence units throughout the country by way of central training and the supply of vehicles, boats, uniforms and personal protective equipment for volunteers.<\/p><p>The Government also values the service of the Reserve Defence Force and on behalf of the Government, I commend the voluntary effort made by members of the Reserve Defence Force and thank them for their ongoing dedication and enthusiasm, particularly those who assisted in the national Covid-19 response.  We have a lot of work to do to build the Reserve to what it should be.  It is one of the key actions from the commission report on which I hope we can make some early progress.  I believe that we can do that.  There is an appetite for people to join the Reserve if we create the right conditions and context for those efforts.  I look forward to bringing forward recommendations to the Government on that.<\/p><p> In addition to the Commission on the Defence Forces, I also want to advise members of the strategic review and development process currently under way within the Department.  This process, which is nearing completion, includes a comprehensive independent organisation capability review of my Department.  It will provide an assessment of the Department&rsquo;s capabilities and capacity to deliver on objectives and will present an opportunity for my Department to take positive actions to address any gaps that may emerge from this review process.  When we launched the Commission on the Defence Forces, there was a view that we were effectively applying a rigorous scrutiny to the Defence Forces but were not applying similar scrutiny to the Department.  That is simply not true.  Any organisation worth its salt must be open to outside assessments and benchmarks and so on.  I will be willing to learn lessons from that.  I certainly believe the Defence Forces are up for that, and the Department is too.<\/p><p> To conclude, I am very proud of the Defence Forces and all that they achieve, both nationally and internationally. However, as outlined in the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, there are many challenges facing the Defence Forces and the Department, both now and in the future, with significant levels of further engagement, collaboration, adjustment and legislative change envisaged over the coming years.  I accept that the level of ambition and change outlined in the report is potentially far-reaching and, if implemented, could necessitate significant increases in defence funding.  There is no secret there.  There are other pressing changes, however, which are also required and which are not resource-intensive.  I remain committed to leading the required change, as I believe it has the capacity to transform our Defence Forces, and the choice of a career in the Defence Forces for the many people who serve there, over the coming years.<\/p><p> Committee members have been provided with briefing material on both the Defence and Army Pensions Estimates and I look forward to positive engagement, as well as any questions or comments that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#A00700","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I thank the Minister for his opening statement.  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces is a comprehensive report and key elements of the report need to be implemented.  It will certainly go a long way to addressing many of the challenges and difficulties within the Defence Forces around pay and retention, which certainly needs to be done with immediate effect.  One of the primary and key asks in that report, and of the representative bodies, is the right to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Given the upcoming pay talks, I believe that this needs to be acted upon immediately.  I preface my contribution with this request.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to it.  The representative bodies have continually asked for it, and I too have sought it.  It is a key recommendation within the report, as is the issue around the working time directive, which is a major issue that also needs to be addressed.  I do not see anything in the Estimates here in this regard, even as an initial attempt to start trying to record the hours that the members of the Defence Forces are actually doing, without fully implementing the directive in full.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with Vote 35 first.  There is not a lot that I have to say on Vote 35 other than on the post-1994 contracts.  I welcome that some movement has been made around the huge difficulty this creates for members of the Defence Forces and the future they see for themselves within the Defence Forces.  I am aware there are still issues that need to be resolved, for example with regard to sergeants.  I note there will also be a knock-on effect for pensions. Will the Minister give an overview as to where that situation is and what agreement has been reached on that long-standing issue with the post-1994 contracts?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#C01500","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>On the basis of Deputy Brady raising Vote 35, subhead A1, I propose that we dispose of that now.

On page 3 of the Minister's opening statement, we see that 12,890 people are in receipt of Army pensions.  That is a massive number.  My observation is that there are 50% more people on military pensions than are actually serving in the Defence Forces.  It just shows how small our Defence Forces complement has become.<\/p><p>The other statement the Minister made was, \"and their numbers continue to rise year on year\".  That is an accurate statement.  It shows the importance of retention and stopping that haemorrhage of people.  When people hit 50 or 60 years of age, they have to retire but there are many people retiring before that age.  The actuarial problem here is that not only are you paying the military pension of the people who retire but you are paying the military salary for their replacements as well.  I want to place the emphasis on it being important that we try to retain people in the organisation.<\/p><p> My final observations is that there is &euro;271 million for pensions.  A quarter of the entire defence budget is going towards military pensions.  The only thing I want to emphasise there is that retention is essential.  If we can keep these highly-skilled, highly-motivated, highly-professional people in the organisation, it will save money in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#C01700","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>Deputy Lawless will be followed by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#D00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and welcome the Minister and his officials to the committee.<\/p> <p>  On the pensions subhead, because I understand we are taking each subhead at a time, I flicked through the Estimates to try to find the answer to this.

All I am saying is we are working on implementation plans and consideration of all the recommendations in the commission report.  There is a recommendation that the Permanent Defence Force representative associations should be facilitated if they wish to pursue associate membership of ICTU.  It is important to understand what associate membership, as opposed to affiliation, is.  We are speaking to members of the commission who made their recommendation.  We are also speaking to the representative organisations on how we will proceed on that and, obviously, to the Department as well.  We will be bringing recommendations forward.<\/p> <p>  There is an element of time pressure on this because the new round of public sector pay talks will be probably getting under way in May.  I am conscious that that is a time pressure we need to take note of on this issue, particularly given the interests of PDFORRA but also the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, in regard to the relationship they will or will not have with ICTU in the context of those discussions.  As I have always said, I have an open mind on this.<\/p> <p>  By the way, we have also started an initial discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as is agreed to in the programme for Government, on a separate pay body for defence and how the two issues of potential associate membership of ICTU and having a separate pay consideration body could be married together.  It is not straightforward because they are two very different approaches to how you assess and manage pay, and potentially consideration around allowances as well, in the Defence Forces.  There is work already very much under way on both of those issues.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the working time directive, that is more straightforward.  We have committed to implementation of the working time directive.  That requires legislation but it also requires a recognition that the work of the Defence Forces at times can be different from other work fields and, therefore, within the confines of the working time directive there also needs to be recognition of military service as well in certain circumstances.  It is important to say that the working time directive is already a guideline in many ways in terms of the ask of many in the Defence Forces but there is more work to conclude there and to finalise legislation on.  By the way, that legislation needs to come from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as opposed to the Department of Defence, as far as I know.<\/p> <p>  On the post-1994 contracts issue, in December last agreement was secured with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an increase in service limits for privates and corporals recruited to the Permanent Defence Force since 1 January 1994.  This will allow such personnel to remain in service up to 50 years of age subject to meeting certain criteria, including medical and fitness standards.  Agreement was also secured which will allow for sergeants recruited since 1 January 1994 to continue to serve beyond 50 years of age.  Details on the proposal for sergeants will be finalised following further discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There will also be a discussion with PDFORRA, the representative association for enlisted personnel.  These revised arrangements follow a review of barriers of extended participation in the Permanent Defence Force as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission in the report of recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force.  Other recommendations in the review relating to commissioned officers, senior non-commissioned officers and personnel in certain technical appointments will be considered in the forum of an interdepartmental working group which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established to consider mandatory retirement ages for public service groups which have fast-accrual pension arrangements, as many in the Defence Forces do.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Berry's comments, it is important to say that we have significantly more people who are ex-Defence Forces than currently in the Defence Forces.  That is not unusual in many countries because people tend - sometimes they are required - to retire earlier than those in many other careers or else they choose to retire.  Not everybody chooses to spend all of their working life in the Defence Forces.  The Deputy is a good example of that but many other people are too.<\/p> <p>  I take the point Deputy Berry made in terms of trying to keep people in the Defence Forces for longer, holding on to that skill set and that experience, particularly in the context of what we must try to do now in terms of responding to the challenges the commission has put forward for us.  Not only do we have to get an extra 1,000 people into the Defence Forces to get us to the establishment of 9,500 that we should be at, but we must find a way, if we follow the recommendations and if I get Government agreement on that, to get an extra 2,000 people into the Defence Forces plus a significant increase in the number of people in the Reserve as well.  Recruitment, training and intake need to be a substantial factor in building up the numbers in the next few years as well as retention because, of course, turnover is not good if you are having a significant net increase each year given the level of experience that will be available to the Defence Forces, often in challenging environments.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the net increases we will have to deliver each year.  While we have not yet settled on an exact figure and how we will deliver it, if we are to get to the second level of ambition in the commission's report, that will mean we will have to deliver an additional 2,000 people in the Defence Forces, which effectively means an additional 3,000, given we are 1,000 behind where we should be.  Doing that in the space of five or six years or whatever period is agreed will require very significant net increases in the number of Defence Forces personnel each year, and that will put considerable pressure on the system.  Structural change, external HR management expertise and so on have been recommended to help us deliver those kinds of numbers, as well as a potentially increased civilianisation of some of the roles within the Defence Forces.  There are many challenges there, but the general point the Deputy made about the importance of retention is central to how successful we will be in delivering on the recommendations and the numbers that have been set out for us.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Lawless on Defence Forces pensions, it is not always the case that pensions in a certain sector are taken in an entirely separate Vote, although it is the case here because the number is so significant.  The issues are relatively straightforward and it is about ensuring we have enough money each year, which I am glad we have had in recent years.  There was a practice for a number of years whereby there needed to be a Revised Estimate each year to meet the Army pensions bill, but that has not been the case in recent years.  The team has really got it right in terms of Estimates and recommendations to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I expect we will be well covered this year with the additional &euro;8 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#D00800","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>Is that a defined benefit pool, a defined contribution pool or both?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#E00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>It is a defined benefit pool.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#E00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>Is it paid out of current funding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#E00400","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>Yes, it is paid out of current expenditure from a defined benefit pool, which is the case for many public sector pensions in order that there is certainty of income linked to the contributions made throughout a person's career.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#E00500","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>Is there any intention to ring-fence funding that will be in place under investment to be paid out each year?

I take the point that this approach is taken regularly within the private sector, but that is not how public sector pensions work given the guarantees arising from defined benefit pension schemes.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanton asked about abatement of retirement pensions where someone rejoins the public sector.  From 1 November 2012, where public servants retire on a pension and take up a new job anywhere within the public service, their retirement pension may be reduced or suspended for as long as they remain in that job.  This is called pension abatement.  For practical purposes, this means a person's combined earnings from the current public service job as well as from his or her existing public service pension cannot exceed the current equivalent of his or her pensionable pay from the first job.  This measure was introduced with effect from 1 November 2012 under the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 and applies without exception to all public service pension schemes, including the new single scheme.  A pensioner already in public service employment immediately before that date is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post or position.  The measure does not apply to employment with the commercial semi-State bodies.<\/p> <p>  Before the 2012 change, the abatement principle operated as a standard feature of the public service pension schemes generally, but only within individual sectors where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former job, such as the Defence Forces, Garda, Civil Service and so on.  The 2012 Act extended the principle to all sectors without exception, thereby restoring the arrangements that had been in place until 1965.  Any change of status since 1 November 2012 constitutes a new job.  Those not subject to pension abatement in respect of their current job, such as because they were appointed before that date, will be subject to abatement if, after that date, they secure a new post through promotion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#E00700","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>My understanding is the change was brought in as part of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, although I may be wrong about that.

If an enlisted soldier, say, of private or corporal rank, retires after 31 years' service, he or she will get a 31-year pension, perhaps in his or her late 50s or at 60-years-old.  When he or she hits 66, he or she will get the old age pension, but the 31-year pension will be pushed back down to a 21-year pension.  It seems this issue is unique to the Defence Forces, although I am open to correction if that is not the case.  If a garda, a prison officer or a firefighter has 31 years' service, he or she will keep the 31-year pension and it will be included with the old age pension.  There appears to be an anomaly in the Defence Forces whereby service of 31 years is pushed back to 21 years when the old age pension is drawn down, but that does not happen in the rest of the public service.

This might be a technical answer to a technical question, but I will give it in any event.  In the case of pre-April 2004 enlisted personnel, their basic 21-year Defence Forces pension is payable for life.  An additional increment is payable on top of that basic pension for service of between 22 and 31 years, as the Deputy pointed out.  Under the pension scheme rules, however, this increment ceases payment when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age for the social welfare contributory State pension, namely, between the ages of 66 and 68, depending on when the insured person was born.  This is in accordance with the long-established principle of integrating occupational pensions with the social insurance benefits of employees who are in the full PRSI class, including non-commissioned officers, NCOs, and privates, who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits, such as the State pension, which are regarded as part of the person's overall pension package.

I impress again on the Minister the importance and urgency of making a swift and correct decision to allow the associate membership to proceed.

In 2019, some 1,673 people were in the Reserve Defence Force.  In 2020, there were 1,588 and in 2021, the figure was down to 1,489.  Some of the issues have been articulated by the representative body for the RDF and they have been identified by the commission.  The Minister touched on it himself that those recommendations must be implemented immediately.  One of the major issues was the length of time it takes to bring in a new recruit when a person applies to join the RDF.  In some cases, it has taken more than two years.  People's lives move on, and their interests shift.  That is a major failure.  Could the Minister elaborate on what it entails when he says immediate action needs to be taken?<\/p> <p>  A very important decision was taken last year on legislation to allow members of the RDF to participate more fully in Defence Force operations and potentially to be deployed overseas, but there is a whole piece of work concerning workers' rights that is needed as part of that.  Employer organisations need to become stakeholders in the process.  There is a need for stringent workers' rights to ensure that members of the retained service who may choose to go on overseas deployment are not punished by their employer and do not lose out as a result of that.

If something is not done to arrest this, that organisation will disappear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#G00300","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanton.

On page 5, it states that 19% of the Defence Forces served overseas in 2020, which is a staggering number.  I want to emphasise that.  When one fifth of an organisation is spending six months overseas, it has massive implications for family separation and all the social issues that go with that.  It emphasises why we need to have more substitutes on the bench, basically, and a larger organisation to maintain our overseas commitments.<\/p> <p>  Also on page 5 is a list of memorandums of understanding and service level agreements with various organisations in the country.  I understand there is a memorandum of understanding between the Irish Defence Forces and the UK armed forces.  Would it be possible to get a copy of that?  I believe it is only a small document.  I genuinely have not actually seen it myself.  Perhaps it could be circulated to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence if possible.<\/p> <p>  On page 8, and I agree with Deputy Stanton, it is concerning that the number of PDF troops in the Air Corp, navy and Army are dropping.  I will juxtapose that with the increasing numbers of civil servants.  Again, we have nothing against civil servants.  Everybody understands that a Government Department needs civil servants.  Many employees in the Department of Defence are actually my constituents.  It is a red flag, however, when the numbers of front-line workers in any organisation are reducing and the numbers of managers are increasing.  We have seen that in the Health Service Executive as well.  It emphasises the importance of retention and proper recruitment in getting as many front-line troops in as possible.  I will also emphasise the Reserve Defence Force, as Deputy Stanton did.  We really need to get those numbers up as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#G00600","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I have a question regarding the context and impact indicators on page 6.

It has not withdrawn its case as of yet anyway.  I have spoken to it directly about that.  I have a very good relationship with PDFORRA.  If we are going to progress this issue, however, I am not going to do it under threat of legal action.  I think that is well understood.  There needs to be some good faith here.  I can understand the reason the legal action came about and I respect that.  However, we are now in the space of having a very short period before the public sector pay rounds start.  If we are going to make progress on this, it would be helpful if there was not a legal action still pending.<\/p> <p>  In terms of allowances, Deputy Brady raised the issue of a specialist instructor allowance.  That is a specific issue the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, raises all the time with me.  I can understand the argument it makes.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's view on this is very clear.  There was a negotiated buy-out, essentially, of that specialist instructor allowance under a previous pay round discussion and negotiation.  RACO does not accept that; we are happy to work with it to try to progress this issue.  I met with RACO last week and we spoke about this issue.  I want to be helpful if I can.  We also need to be realistic, however, in terms of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's view on this issue.  It is something on which we can hopefully find a way forward as part of a new round of discussions or negotiations around public sector pay, or in advance of that if it is possible to do so.  I will continue to speak to RACO with regard to this, however.<\/p> <p>  Given the pressure on training and need for instructors in terms of the level of recruitment we will need to facilitate and encourage in the years ahead, I can certainly see why there would be a strong argument around ensuring that we can incentivise specialist instructors to move into that space.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the sea service commitment scheme, as far as I know, 103 people are in that scheme now.  We are looking at how we can broaden that.  It took a year to negotiate this scheme and get it agreed.  It was not easy because a public sector pay round was under discussion.  What we could not do in the Naval Service, essentially, was increase pay in a straightforward pay increase fashion.  That would have had a knock-on impact in terms of pay negotiations in other sectors and so on.<\/p> <p>  That is why this is quite targeted for people who have been in the Naval Service for three years and who are willing to commit to go to sea for a number of years.  They get quite a significant financial recognition of that commitment in the sea service commitment scheme.  Let me give members the updated figures.  The new service commitment scheme was introduced in January 2021 for officers and enlisted personnel in the Naval Service who satisfied the following conditions: they must have a minimum of three years' service at ensign-able seaman grade and give an undertaking to serve for an aggregate of 24 months at sea, and a minimum number of 240 patrol days, over a maximum 48-month reference period.  There is a total payment of &euro;10,000 for this commitment and that is to be paid in stages.  Stage payments of &euro;2,500 are made following each six-month period of seagoing rotation on confirmation that the individual delivers the required minimum 60 patrol days per six-month period.<\/p> <p>  To date, the military authorities have advised that 103 applicants for the seagoing service commitment scheme have been approved.  Payments for the first tranche of this scheme have been processed for a total of 70 personnel to date.  The scheme remains open for further applicants as they commence their seagoing rotation.  Would we like a broader scheme than that?  Yes, I think so.<\/p> <p>  We have particular recruitment and retention issues in the Naval Service.  That is not just a pay issue, by the way.  It is a lifestyle issue as well, which is why one of the recommendations in the commission report is that we would look at double crewing for ships so that people would not have to spend as long at sea, which many find difficult in terms of family life and so on, particularly when there are alternatives in the workforce, the private sector and other opportunities in the public sector.  We must, therefore, make it more attractive to be in the Naval Service and go to sea.  We have to reward that financially but we also have to make sure the lifestyle issues and retention issues around HR management and so on for people in the Defence Forces are prioritised.  It is a combination of all those things.<\/p><p>That is why there are clear recommendations on this in the commission's report.  Its recommendation is that we provide immediate access to the seagoing service commitment scheme to direct entry personnel into the Naval Service, replace the existing seagoing allowances with less complex seagoing duty measures and make a few other changes that would apply to everybody.  Those are issues we have to consider and talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about, as it ultimately has to sign off on any change to or broadening of criteria.<\/p><p> A number of Deputies raised concerns about the Reserve Defence Force.  I have spoken to reservists who up until a few months ago were very downbeat about the future.  I have heard people say that this service is being allowed to die on its feet.  I can promise that it will not be allowed to do that.  We are committed to the future of the Reserve, to broadening the role of reservists and to bringing in professional expertise around recruitment and what is needed to excite people about opportunities in the Reserve.  That is a clear recommendation of the commission's report.  In fact, there is a whole chapter on it.  We need to set about addressing this issue.  The report also recommends a reserve for the Air Corps.  We would then have reserves in the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps so there would be a presence in Haulbowline, Baldonnel and the Curragh.<\/p><p> I do not want to sugarcoat the problems.  The numbers are way too low and have been falling in recent years.  They are not falling dramatically but they are steadily falling from a low base and that is not good.  It is not good for morale, retention or recruitment.  It is possible to dramatically increase the numbers coming into the Reserve with the right approach.  Deputy Berry said we should be more proactive and should give preferential treatment to people who choose to leave the Defence Forces and allow them the option of staying connected to the Defence Forces by being part of the Reserve.  That is already happening in some cases but we could be more proactive on that.  It is one of a series of things we need to do to invest in the Reserve.  My conversations with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, in the last number of months have been very positive and constructive.  We need to work in partnership with it on this issue.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanton asked about the allowances and the fact that the Estimate is lower than the outturn from last year.  The Estimate is for &euro;48 million.  In 2020 there was an outturn of just under &euro;46.5 million and there was an outturn last year of nearly &euro;52 million.  The reason the allowances for last year are so much higher is that there were a lot of extra Covid duties and extra allowances linked to overtime and so on.  Last year was an extraordinary year for the Defence Forces due to the extra duties and so on.  That is the explanation for that.  If the Estimate is proven wrong this year or we have a new crisis that requires significant extra Defence Forces input, we will revise that figure, but hopefully we have had enough of that.  We will have to wait and see.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawless has gone but he raised the issue of pay.  Each year, our Estimate is calculated on the basis of the establishment number and not on the number of people in the Defence Forces.  We are the only Department, of which I am aware, that has a deal with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this.  Every year we get enough pay for a full complement of the Defence Forces and if that pay is not spent, which it will not be if we are 1,000 people short, we can then transfer that unspent money into other expenditure across the Defence Forces.  Normally that goes into capital expenditure but not always.  There may be other issues as well.  That has been the practice for the last number of years.  I have made it very clear to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that when the number gets back up to the establishment of 9,500, we will need a corresponding increase in the overall budget.  At the moment we are benefiting from that unspent pay money in other areas and it is in many ways supplementing expenditure in those areas that would not be available if we got back up to 9,500.  However, it will take us some time to get there.  I have flagged that with regard to future budgets.<\/p><p> Deputy Berry had a number of questions and comments.  He noted that 19% of Defence Forces members have served overseas.  As the Deputy will know, serving overseas is a central part of being a member of the Irish Defence Forces.  People are trained and equipped for that and plan for it.  It is a huge part of what we do, unlike in many other countries where the priority is often core defence of a state, either along a border or dealing with threats, perceived threats and so on.  Our structures are built around peacekeeping service overseas and peace interventions.  In the future, some of those interventions will become more complex.  We are going to look at doing more chapter VII missions, which will require more complex training, more advanced equipment and better armour.  That has a price tag but that is where we need to be.<\/p><p> I take the point that one in five members of the Defence Forces being overseas for six months of the year, or a decent portion of the year, puts pressures on the system.  There is a lot of talk about the Naval Service.  There was also a lot of talk about problems in the Air Corps because pilots were being lost to the private sector and we had to introduce schemes to get them back.  However, there is not enough talk about the pressure on the Army, particularly linked to service overseas.  It is short of numbers too.  We need to make sure our service overseas is tailored to the resources we have available to us.  For example, we have some decisions to make in the months ahead because French forces are pulling out of Mali.  France has a huge contingent there.  Whether that changes the risk profile of that training mission and the UN mission is a matter we are assessing carefully at the moment.  We got a renewed mandate for a continuation of that training mission for another 12 months from Cabinet just in the last few days.  We will continue to assess that through the summer as France moves out of a country that has, unfortunately, become more volatile and less democratic.  We will take all that into account.<\/p><p> The memorandum of understanding on defence with the UK was signed a number of years ago with the UK's Secretary of State for Defence.  It was predominantly about procurement and training.  Nothing about defence policy was part of that.  It was more a practical memorandum of understanding for sharing knowledge, procurement systems and so on.  I do not know whether I can share it but I will take a look at it.<\/p><p>Some of the memos are confidential and some are not.  If it is not confidential, I will have no issue with sharing it.<\/p><p> Regarding staff numbers in the Department versus the Defence Forces, it is important to say that, because we have had pressures in the Defence Forces in terms of recruitment, retention and being under strength, it does not mean that there should be a corresponding loss of numbers in the Department of Defence.  One is not contingent on the other.  We need a Department that is well resourced and is doing the job that is asked of it, and that is what the Department of Defence is doing.  We have a significant issue to deal with in terms of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces and we need a well-resourced Department to help us do that.  I do not believe that those comparisons are comparing like with like and that, if the Defence Forces are under pressure, it is all of a sudden not balanced if the Department is not under pressure as well.  I know the Deputy is not suggesting that, but there has not been a significant increase in staffing numbers in the Department.  We could well make a strong case for increased numbers in our Department, given the work that will be involved in bringing about transformational change and growth in the defence sector on the back of the commission's report.  I take the Deputy's point, but the two organisations have different roles to play.<\/p><p> A number of personnel in the Department work in specialist areas of the Defence Forces.  Even without the commission's report, we should not underestimate the civil-military partnership that is necessary to deliver the change that is needed in the Defence Forces, be that cultural change and modernisation or our work on gender issues linked to that culture.  We have a very busy Department and it is not going to get less busy any time soon.<\/p><p> This brings me on to the matter of the number of women in the Defence Forces.  When we put the White Paper together in 2015, we set a target of, if I remember correctly, approximately 12%.  Currently, we are at 7%, or essentially half of where we need to be.  I will provide the actual numbers on female strength.  In 2016, the figure was 2.6%, although the inducted figure was 7.8%.  In 2017, the figure was 6.5%.  In 2018, it was 6.7%.  In 2019, it was 6.9%.  In 2020, it was 7%.  There has been a gradual, but slow, increase year after year.  Of those we are inducting into the Defence Forces, between 7% and 8% are women.  According to the challenge that has been put to us by the commission, that figure needs to be more than 30%, so one third of people entering the Defence Forces should be women.  There are few, if any, countries in the world that are achieving those numbers, but we have to set ourselves a target.  It will take us time to get into the double figures and move on from there, but the Defence Forces will be made a more attractive career option for women through a combination of better HR management; expertise from outside the Defence Forces contributing to HR management and transformation in the Defence Forces, which was a recommended structural change as part of a new defence headquarters with a chief of defence, or CHOD, and a non-military HR head of transformation reporting into that office at a senior level; and multiple recommendations on bringing about cultural change, introducing much more family-friendly practices within the Defence Forces and ensuring that there is more transparency and clarity around promotion opportunities and a complete zero-tolerance approach towards discrimination and bullying, whether it is based on gender or other factors.  Making it a more attractive career option for women is badly needed because the contribution they can make to the Defence Forces more broadly will be considerable if we can change those numbers.  This applies across the service, including the Reserve.<\/p><p> The report does not pull its punches in terms of the gender issues in the Defence Forces.  It is my intention, and that of my Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and our teams, to deliver significant change in this regard.  The role that the Women of Honour and others have played in exposing the unacceptable nature of the treatment and experience of some women in the Defence Forces will bring about significant change.  I am determined that that will be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#G01100","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>I understand that there was to be a report completed by December 2021 on pregnancy-related and other discrimination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#J00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>I am not aware of any recommendation that has come through to me on that yet apart from conversations I have had with members of the Defence Forces regarding the lack of family-friendly practices, particularly in the context of pregnancy and commitments to go to sea and the like, parental leave, maternity leave and so on.

It is surprising not to see a corresponding increase in medical and healthcare support provision under this subhead.  Will he also comment on that?  Unfortunately, I will have to leave soon to attend another committee meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#K00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>Any issues raised by the Deputy will be responded to by the Minister in writing through the clerk to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#K00700","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>Earlier in the year, we saw our capabilities to defend our neutrality questioned in respect of the planned naval exercise by Russia off the southern coast.  This highlighted many of the deficiencies that have been widely articulated over a considerable period, including in respect of our primary radar capability and our ability to monitor subsea activities.  Given the proximity of highly sensitive data cables between Europe and America, we have been badly exposed.  Much of what has been identified as lacking, including our primary radar capability, was highlighted in the White Paper in 2015.  Unfortunately, there is nothing in this Estimate in terms of building up that capacity.  There are major security concerns stemming from the grotesque invasion of Ukraine by Russia and our ability to defend our neutrality in terms of our responsibilities to police our air and waters and the other areas I mentioned.  The Minister will say the Commission on the Defence Forces has identified what needs to be done but the White Paper also identified measures that needed to be taken, such as those relating to primary radar capability.  There is no provision here for any of that.  Will he comment broadly in this regard?<\/p> <p>  On subhead A15, Defence Forces built infrastructure, construction and maintenance, this committee has embarked on a number of barracks visits, including to Haulbowline, most recently, and the Curragh.  While it is welcome to see some capital investment in infrastructure in both locations, it was very evident from our visits that a greater level of investment is required into the future.  I am acutely aware of the five-year capital plan but there is no provision in this regard in the plan.  The derelict houses that would previously have been used as married quarters are very visible to anyone driving through the Curragh.  When I was there, I asked what the intention is for those houses that are lying vacant.  We talk about the need to increase the number of women in the Defence Forces, with a high target of 30% rightly set by the commission.  What is the plan by the Department and the Minister for the houses in the Curragh?  In the midst of a housing crisis, it is crazy for them to be left vacant.  Leaving that aside, there is all this talk of making the Defence Forces more family-friendly.  Does the Minister not see a role for those houses in that regard?  Female members of the Defence Forces have to travel to the Curragh for specific training and be away from young children.  Does he not see a role for those houses to be brought back into use to facilitate women in those circumstances?  I do not see any plan for their use.  Something could be developed along those lines to make the organisation more family-friendly.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, touched on the issue of rations, which was highlighted earlier in the year by PDFORRA.  I understand the current ration is &euro;4.20 a day to feed members of the Defence Forces.  In 2010, it was &euro;4.80, at which point it was cut to &euro;4.20.  Twelve years later, notwithstanding the rate of inflation and everything else, that rate has stayed static and is out of line with other sectors of the public service.  Is this issue being looked at and what is being done to address it?  Does the Minister consider such a rate to be sustainable and right?  For overseas deployment, the ration is something in the region of &euro;6.  Members of the Defence Forces have to go overseas to be better fed.  There is a serious issue in this regard and it is one that has been highlighted.  I want to hear whether it is being looked at with a view to increasing the ration.  If I am reading the document correctly, the Estimate proposes a 4% decrease in the allocation for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#K00800","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>Can the Deputy point me to the relevant part of the document?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#K00900","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I do not have it to hand but will try to locate it for the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#K01000","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>That is fine.

The primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to cybersecurity relates to the Defence Forces and the security of its networks and systems.  The Defence Forces and the Department of Defence work with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on an ongoing basis on the delivery of measures to improve the cybersecurity of the State.  The Defence Forces provide support to the National Cyber Security Centre and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in line with the programme for Government commitment to implement the national cybersecurity strategy.  I assure members that my Department and the Defence Forces implement a programme of continuous review in respect of ICT security to keep up to date with current threat levels.  We also have a member of the Defence Forces in the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre in Tallinn in Estonia, which is probably the leading organisation in the EU on it.<\/p> <p>  The commission report references cybersecurity a great deal.  The report contains a large number of recommendations relating to cybersecurity, and the Government will now consider the future development of the Defence Forces in light of that report.  Members of the Defence Forces and officials from the Department of Defence are actively involved in the implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy.  This includes work to develop and update detailed risk assessment of the current vulnerability of all critical national infrastructure.  The response to cyber threats is a whole-of-government challenge, with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications taking the lead role.  From an operational perspective, it would be inappropriate to comment on the cyber capability of the Defence Forces other than to say there is ongoing development of cyber capabilities in the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>  Members are right to raise the issue because we know there is a significant cyber risk to Ireland.  We had a very significant cyberattack on our health systems and the HSE in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic that put many patients at risk and cost the Government a considerable amount of money to fix.  Neutrality does not mean we are safe.  There are both state and non-state actors that want to interfere with our systems.<\/p> <p>  In terms of built infrastructure, it is one of the big increases in expenditure in these Estimates.  There is a significant increase in the built infrastructure.  I will give the committee a sense of the significant projects that were completed during 2021, and we will build beyond that.  There was construction of two new gymnasia at Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick and Stephens Barracks in Kilkenny at a combined cost of &euro;6.2 million.  Provision of a new electric target range at The Curragh was &euro;2.1 million.  There was a no danger area, NDA, range at Gormanston, a personnel support service resource centre in Collins Barracks in Cork, which I opened, and replacement of standby generators at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  There is a series of built infrastructure upgrades.  Deputy Berry is right.  We operate out of barracks that were put in place in a different era.  Many of the buildings are historical and substantial, but they have to be upgraded and modernised from an energy point of view and from a quality of life and quality of work perspective.<\/p> <p>  There is far too much dereliction in The Curragh.  People talk about that, but we have to prioritise the capital spend we have available.  Everyone who is calling for more expenditure might tell me what projects they want me to drop and not proceed with.  We cannot deal with the dereliction overnight.  We can do it in a phased way as we increase our budgets, which we are doing with our capital budget.  We are spending the highest capital budget this year since before the crash in 2008.  I hope to be able to continue to increase that expenditure.  There is significant work to be done in The Curragh, Haulbowline and in other barracks.  Much of that is on a multi-annual investment programme, which I am happy to share with colleagues.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the radar issue, the White Paper recommends we look at that, resources permitting.  It has been a question of prioritisation.  It is easy to do everything if one has a limitless budget, which we do not have.  We have an increasing budget every year and I hope that will continue.  We will make recommendations regarding radar facilities in the context of experience, the commission report and the White Paper, but it is resource contingent.  That is why we need to spend more money on defence.  When Members stand up in the D&aacute;il or Seanad and say we should not be investing in weaponry and defence systems because somehow that is a militarisation of Ireland, it is not.  It is about ensuring our Defence Forces are operating in the right training environments and have the right equipment and training systems to be able to perform their role on land, at sea and in the air.  In my view, that requires significantly more investment on both the capital and current sides.  It is up to me to try to get that response from the Government, it is hoped before the summer break, in terms of the response to the commission report.  We have a very strong evidence base now to back that up.<\/p> <p>  Also, the Deputy spoke about lessons learned in the context of a potential Russian naval exercise.  It was not in Irish waters, actually, but in international waters that Ireland has responsibility for monitoring and observing.  We need to be honest with ourselves.  We could quadruple our defence budget and not have the defence capacity to repel a Russian naval fleet wanting to come into our waters.  Let us get into the real world here.  At present, what we are being asked to do by a commission report is to improve capacity in multiple areas.  It recommends we should consider moving beyond that but accepts this will take a lot more time in the context of issues such as fighter jets and so forth, which some people seem to think is pie in the sky.  The truth is that Ireland's capacity in conventional defence is quite limited.  We need to have a much better understanding in terms of information and observation in both the air and sea and we need to invest accordingly.  I hope we will.<\/p> <p>  What the commission is asking us to do when comparing Ireland with other peer group countries of similar size, wealth and defence perspectives is to move from spending a third of what they spend on average per year to spending a half of what they spend relative to GDP.  We have to put that into context, particularly in the context of what we are seeing now in Ukraine.  Very fundamental questions must be asked with regard to security, stability, our place in the European Union and what contribution we can make towards protecting our way of life, which we have been a part of building in the European Union, given the threats we are seeing to the east at present.  That will be a discussion that will also be part of the consideration of the commission's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#L00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#L00300","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>Can I answer the question on rations, in case I am accused of avoiding the question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#L00400","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#L00500","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>Defence Forces personnel engaged in security duties, approved training courses and operational exercises and single personnel living in barracks may avail of daily meals in certain circumstances.

This rate is reviewed periodically to counter inflation impacts.

We are going through a process that is appropriate and necessary but, certainly, my responsibility is to the Defence Forces.  More than 1,000 people serve in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  It is a considerably significant military installation in the heart of Dublin city.  We are assessing that, but there are no preconceived outcomes or anything like that.  As far as I am concerned, it is a very important part of our military infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked about the figure with regard to land and premises sales.  The figure is &euro;200,000.  It is relatively small in the bigger scheme of things.  There are no big sales there.  That is for sure.<\/p> <p>  Things are happening in terms of defence infrastructure, such as St. Bricin's medical facility in Dublin 7.  The Deputy knows where that is.  It is in a very strategic location in Dublin.  The Land Development Agency is very interested in acquiring that.  We will build a new medical facility in Baldonnel which is funded and will move ahead this year.  I have made it very clear that we can only close one facility if we build a new modern facility.  However, the St. Bricin's site can make a valuable contribution from a housing perspective.  It is in a strategic location.<\/p> <p>  The Department has also had proactive engagement with the LDA following its interest in Collins Barracks in Mullingar for the development of housing.  These facilities are not being used any longer by the Defence Forces.  We look to strategically work with another arm of the State to ensure we can make a contribution from a housing perspective.  I reassure the Deputy of that.<\/p> <p>  Since 2019, the Department of Defence has been provided with &euro;3.6 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  In 2019, Civil Defence was allocated &euro;500,000 which was used to procure 16 4x4 passenger vehicles.  In 2020, Civil Defence was allocated funding of &euro;1 million to upgrade its fleet.  In 2020, it was allocated another &euro;1 million.  The Army veterans associations were also allocated total funding of &euro;300,000.  Sail Training Ireland was allocated &euro;50,000.<\/p> <p>  This year, Civil Defence has been allocated &euro;500,000 to upgrade its fleet again.  The Army veterans associations have been allocated another &euro;200,00 in funding.  That is the Dormant Accounts Fund element which is, essentially, capital injections on top of the money that we also allocate to Civil Defence.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to Deputy Berry's questions.  First, I was quite involved in the design of the European peace facility because I wanted Ireland to be part of it.  I did not want to be outside of that.  Ireland, Austria and Malta have a particular perspective here that we want to contribute to a European peace facility in which the EU can effectively pool its resources to make an intervention in a part of the world and that can respond to conflict or instability in a way that promotes peace and so on.<\/p> <p>  However, there are two funds within the peace facility.  One can fund lethal weapons and the other can fund other elements of the project that are not lethal weapons but can be helmets, gloves, fuel, medical kits, defensive vests and such.  The same project can be funded by two funds: one for lethal weapons and the other for non-lethal weapons.<\/p> <p>  When we designed the European peace facility, we never envisaged that it would be deployed in the heart of Europe in response to an illegal war on Ukraine by Russia.  That has now been used as the tool to fund and support the Ukrainian military in an effort to defend itself.  It is a &euro;500 million fund.  Some &euro;450 million of that is focused on lethal weapons and &euro;50 million of it is focused on other equally important and necessary but non-lethal weaponry.<\/p> <p>  We contribute our full amount as a percentage of the &euro;500 million.  Some 1.9% is the allocation key, which is between &euro;9 million and &euro;10 million.  This is the same as every other country but we focus our financial contribution on non-lethal weaponry, or the &euro;50 million element of the fund.  In percentage terms, we make the same contribution as any other country.<\/p> <p>  We are also looking at what contribution we can make in terms of actual stores of equipment.  I have heard Deputy Berry call on me to look at providing Javelin anti-tank weaponry and so on.  We have decided not to provide lethal weaponry but, even if we did, we do not have excess stockpiles of Javelins.  I have looked at the infantry of equipment and asked for a report on that.<\/p> <p>  While it is true we have some, we also have a training use and obligations in terms of equipment linked to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and so on.  There is not a large stockpile of excess equipment that we could share, even if we wanted to.  We have also looked at defensive equipment such as helmets, vests and so on.  There are some limited excess stocks.<\/p> <p>  One of the areas we have extra stocks is in food parcels that would be very useful for soldiers in the field.  We are looking at stocks we can share.  However, most of our contribution will be financial to efficiently purchase equipment and stocks and get them in to Ukraine, as quickly as we can, in order that young men and women who sign up and join can get defensive equipment to protect themselves in the context of the war in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  We are making a full contribution but it is important that people understand we have looked at all the options in terms of what is available and what is not.  We are acting on the basis of providing as much product, as quickly as we can, using the efficient channels that are open to us to get product into people who need it in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the &euro;23 million underspend, as it happens, a number of Departments had underspends last year.  Some of that is linked to Covid.  From our perspective, much of the building work that was due to move ahead last year was significantly behind schedule.  We simply were not able to go on site for a significant portion of the year because of Covid restrictions.  That stalled things.<\/p> <p>  We also tried to spend the majority of that money on procurement of equipment on which we expected to be able to sign off in December but will not be able to sign off until this month.<\/p><p>That was unfortunate because I certainly would have liked to have spent all of the money available to us last year.  We cannot carry that money over because that is not the way the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform works.  The conversation on how we should respond to the commission in respect of increased resourcing will need to take place in the context of the recommendations I will bring to the Government in June.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will be central to those resourcing conversations because we cannot facilitate the level of ambition on structural and cultural change and increased resourcing contained in the commission report without an all-of-government commitment from the three party leaders and, of course, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  All of that money has to deliver an outcome and must represent value for money because the availability of money is finite.  We are competing with many other Departments which are also making claims from the national Exchequer.  We have a very strong evidence base now from the commission report to make progress in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022030900002#N00700","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister on behalf of the select committee and on my own behalf both for his attendance and for dealing in such a comprehensive manner with the many questions over a variety of areas and Votes.

This Bill was published back in 2018.  It is an ambition of my party's and mine that the excessive charges that are being applied by moneylenders to, in some regards, very vulnerable people are dealt with.  We should not be allowing the type of rates that are applying.  While we have had support at different levels, including on Second Stage, there is a clear kind of cat-and-mouse game, which I think is disappointing for the body politic, because sometimes this committee works well.  We have a piece of legislation that was published four years ago, it comes to Committee Stage and, just like that, we have the Government then publishing its own piece of legislation and taking it to Second Stage before this week is out.  That is disappointing because we hear sometimes that we all work together and all of this, but it does not always work like that, at least when it comes to a Bill that we have produced.  It is not the first time.  We have seen the same with the lobbying Bill and we have seen it with other pieces of legislation.  That being said, I am very grateful to all of the people and, particularly, our witnesses, who contributed during pre-legislative scrutiny to this piece of legislation, which has improved and shaped the amendments that we put forward.  I note that some of the issues that were discussed in relation to my Bill in pre-legislative scrutiny have found their way into the Government&rsquo;s Bill.

It replaces &quot;the cost of credit to be charged being excessive&quot; with &quot;the cost of credit being usurious or excessively high&quot;, terms which are then defined under amendment No. 3.<\/p><p>I oppose amendment No. 1 first on the basis that, taken on its own, it does not add any value to the Act of 1995.  I have a note that combines this amendment with amendment No. 3 and if the Vice Chairman is happy to do it, I can deal with amendments Nos. 1 and 3 together because they are connected.  When taken with amendment No. 3, I must oppose amendment No. 1 on the basis that it does not represent the most effective way to cap the interest charged on moneylending loans.  I do not say this to be obstructive but because officials in the Department of Finance considered this approach of tying the cap to the licensing framework, and this method was included in the general scheme of that Bill last July.  Essentially, the Government's approach last July was similar.  However, in the meantime, and with the benefit of the involvement of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting, the Government Bill published recently refined its approach. <\/p><p>Section 93(10) provides for the grounds for refusal to grant a licence only and it would therefore have no effect once a licence has been granted.  The rates proposed to be charged in the licensing process must accord with the caps under the Government Bill, but it also goes much further.  The Government Bill now makes the cap a standalone requirement in respect of each loan offered, as opposed to the original licence application, and it makes it an offence for a moneylender to provide a loan above that rate.  This is more straightforward and meaningful for individual customers as it is a requirement in respect of each loan and not a general matter considered with regard to the licensing process. <\/p><p>From the consumer's perspective - many of these people are vulnerable people who have had to borrow in a difficult position - in dealing with the loan and asking people with an issue to go back to how a licence was granted to the institution in question is very complex and it would be a very difficult process.  We are linking the interest rate to each individual loan, saying that under the licence it would be an offence to charge above the rate in respect of that loan.<\/p><p>The setting of the numerical values of the rates in subsections (1) and (2) is also at odds with the power of the Minister to adjust the rates by regulation under subsection (7).  We also consider this significant as asking the Minister to adjust rates by regulation would not conform with original numerical values set in primary legislation.  There could be a difficulty if regulations were not in exact conformity with primary legislation.  Again, I say this as the Government's drafting process has benefited from engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and there is a risk that the method proposed by the Deputy would constitute an amendment of primary legislation by way of secondary legislation, which would be <i>ultra vires<\/i>the authority of the Minister under secondary legislation.  We have had the benefit over recent months of refining and examining what we think is the most legally sound basis to deal with the matter.<\/p><p>With regard to the level of the rates themselves, while lower interest rates are of course the preference for consumers, there is a need for balance in setting the ceilings to ensure consumers do not face the difficulty of having to go without credit where providers leave the market either suddenly or en masse.  We have had some withdrawals from the market.  The moneylending industry remains an important source of credit for a significant number of people.  The rates proposed for the first three years and the period thereafter set a rigid approach, which presupposes the level of reduction that the market can take in three years' time without any analysis and which would require primary legislation to amend in any event.<\/p><p>The Government Bill, in contrast, sets ceilings above which the cap can be set and provides for the Minister to have regard to a number of principles and policies set down in the primary legislation when making regulations to set the specific caps.  This provides more flexibility to amend the caps in response to relevant policy factors while ensuring that the rate can never be set at such a level as to make it an artificial cap.  The Government Bill also incorporates the consultation with the Central Bank which the Deputy and the committee favours.<\/p><p>The legislation passed Second Stage in December 2018 and in May 2021 there was a consultation process.  In June 2021, Deputy Doherty made a submission to the committee outlining that he would move away from the annual percentage rate cap to an index cap on the total cost of credit over a timeframe of three years.  In November the Oireachtas committee published a report of detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  Deputy Doherty has proposed amendments to the Bill to cap interest rates, including a similar calculation method but at a lower level than what the Government is proposing.  His method of implementing the cap does not make it an offence to offer credit above the rate and it links to the licensing process rather than the individual loans.  It is one of the key issues and it is something we want in the separate legislation that has been published and will be discussed in the D&aacute;il separately later today.  We will deal with the interest charged on loans during the lifetime of a licence rather than referring back to the licence.  People should be able to understand the interest rate they are being charged on a loan but asking people to go back and check the licence as issued by the Central Bank several years earlier, and them trying to work it out on that basis, would be very difficult for many people.<\/p><p>I commend the Deputy on raising this matter and there is consensus in dealing with this but because of the passage of time we have had the advantage of input from the Parliamentary Counsel, scrutiny provided by the Oireachtas and the involvement of the Central Bank and Attorney General.  It is about improving what is a very important issue and everybody agrees with the principle of what the Deputy is proposing.

A contracts Bill was passed unanimously by the Houses of the Oireachtas and I was a sponsor of that, and there was also legislation relating to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which saw real engagement.  Through all the process, and even when the Government put forward its proposals, we offered amendments to try to sharpen the legislation.  Often, these are rejected but on a number of occasions amendments have been accepted or the Minister has agreed to sharpen the legislation as a result on Report Stage.  That approach was not taken by the Government with this legislation and the Government is more interested in having its moneylender Bill.<\/p> <p>  That said, I do not give a damn whose stamp is on the legislation at the end of the day.  The Minister of State speaks of dealing with drafting issues and the benefit of the Attorney General or other advices, which we do not have.  As an Opposition party, we nonetheless expect the process evident in two other pieces of legislation that have been enacted would be seen here.  Unfortunately, that did not happen over four years with this legislation.<\/p> <p>  That said, outside the drafting issues there is a core issue in the Government's Bill, which is that it does not do enough.  It barely scratches the surface on the question of moneylending.  The Minister of State mentioned that people would not have credit and all the rest.  The largest moneylender in this country left the State, as it had hundreds of thousands of customers and many of them were intergenerational.  What did the Government do to create awareness in those consumers about where they could get credit?  Point me to one initiative or press release.  Point me to anything the Government did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#B00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>A major player may have left the market but there are still 36 licensed operators in the market, with 32 actively providing credit in the market.

Many of them are unique and catalogue operators and not lenders that provide loans to cover the communion or birthday party costs.  I am glad the officials are starting to brief the Minister of State on this big issue.  The Government did not do anything on this.  It should have introduced an initiative to encourage the customers of that largest moneylender in the State to go to the credit union where they could get lower cost loans at a fraction of the cost charged by the moneylenders.  That has not happened.  The Government took a hands-off approach in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As amendment No. 3 is being discussed with amendment No. 1, amendment No. 3 proposes to delete section 103 of the principal Act, which sets out collection charges, which would be abolished under amendment No. 2, if they were to be administered.  That is what the original section provided.  The proposed new section 103 would provide for a cap on the rate of interest moneylenders are permitted to charge.  The interest rate cap would be based on simple interest with an initial cap which would then be reduced further after a period of three years.  It would also separate cash loans from loans provided on a running account.  The new interest rate cap as it applies to cash loans would be as follows: a simple interest rate of no more than 0.75% per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum for a period of three years, which is the initial cap in the proposed amendment.  It is proposed there would a simple interest rate of no more than 0.35% per week, which is a reduced rate, up to a maximum of 18% per annum after a period of three years.  That would be the secondary reduced cap.<\/p> <p>  The impact of this cap for borrowers with reference to a &euro;1,000 cash loan over a 12-month term by a credit union compared with the largest moneylender in the State, which the Government should have done something about when Provident pulled out of the market, would be that the total repayments on the loan would be &euro;1,060.  The borrower would be charged &euro;60 in interest.  A moneylender would charge the borrower &euro;1,560, which is &euro;560 in interest.  The ratio of interest charged by the moneylender compared with the credit union is nine times more.  The initial cap proposed in the amendment would be mean the &euro;560 in interest that would be charged would be reduced to &euro;360.  The ratio of interest charged compared with the credit union would be six times more, which is still an very expensive type of credit.  The secondary cap we propose would reduce the initial moneylender's interest from &euro;560 to &euro;180, bringing the ratio between what a credit union would charge compared with a moneylender after three years down to 1:3.<\/p> <p>  Crucially for the moneylender, the total interest payable does not include the impact of collection charges, which we deal with in amendment No. 2.  Those collection charges push up the cost of credit much further.  Therefore, this cap would slash the total cost of credit a moneylender can charge by more than one third and the further cap that would be in place after three years would slash it by more than two thirds.  That would radically reduce the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, thereby protecting consumers, many of whom are vulnerable to vicious cycles of debt, and reduce the interest they are charged.<\/p> <p>  Further provisions of amendment No. 3 require the Central Bank to produce a report at least every three years assessing the cost of credit in the moneylender market and to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance, where they are warranted, to protect the interests of consumers.  There is a requirement for the Central Bank to produce a report within three years.  This is about sending a very clear signal that we are reducing the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, including abolishing collection charges and, after a three-year period, that cost will reduce further.  That is what is necessary to protect people.  It is not what the Minister of State has just told the committee, namely, that if your moneylender has gone, you should go to one of the other 100 moneylenders.  That is not what we need.<\/p> <p>  Most of the reports that comprise studies that have been done in this sector show people who go to moneylenders can access credit from credit unions.  A large number of them also access credit from credit unions.  The issue is the convenience, the door-to-door sales, the fact the operator knows Sheila has John and Mary at home and John is about to make his first holy communion, or that people are asked on their doorstep if they are going on holidays.  The issue is the in-your-face sales because of the convenience and short-term nature of the loans, as a result of which people get trapped into a cycle of high interest rate debt.  I strongly commend amendment No. 1 to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#C00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>I understand what the Deputy has said.  One of the key elements of what we propose builds on the original legislation, the Private Members&rsquo; bill drafted some time ago.  It goes without saying that the longer the period a person has a loan from one of these moneylenders, the more interest he or she will pay over time.  One of the proposals we suggest is the loan would be restricted to 12 months.  That would reduce the amount of interest people would pay over a period of time rather than having loans with a significant high interest rate running for a period of two or three years.<\/p><p>Second, we believe the issue of the credit unions in this regard is vital.  I think we are all <i>ad idem<\/i>on that with respect to credit unions providing more unsecured loans, which they are very good at doing.  It is the biggest sector in the economy providing unsecured loans.  I will be meeting the credit union movement tomorrow to encourage it to lend more in that area given it has such a big footprint with approximately 400 branches around the country.<\/p><p>Up to now, many moneylenders have charged for the door-to-door collection of money.  Every time a moneylender sends somebody out to collect money, that incurs an expensive charge.  The moneylender can charge &euro;40, &euro;50 or &euro;60 for a visit.  We are banning that practice.  All the operator's costs will have to come in under the interest rate.<\/p><p>The views behind the Private Members' Bill are well motivated and are all in the right place, but there are significant extra items that could and should be taken into account regarding this issue and that is why the Government published its legislation.  The Government approved the heads of the Bill last year.  It is not something that has just emerged now.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the Government's proposed legislation was carried out by this committee last October.  Having completed that process last autumn, we listed it as priority legislation on 21 January of this year.  The final text of the Bill was agreed with the Attorney General in mid-February.  It was approved by Government quite recently and has now been published.  The Second Stage debate on the Bill is scheduled for later today.<\/p><p>Overall, the theme behind what the Deputy and the Government are saying is similar but the Government probably has had the advantage of the extra time and extra pre-legislative scrutiny, the excellent paper produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on the Government's proposal, and the benefit of the Attorney General, the Central Bank and the various organisations that made submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  We believe our legislation, as proposed, is the best way to move forward.<\/p><p>When this committee considered the detailed scrutiny of the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018, the Bill before us, some time ago, it was clear in its report when it stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBased on its consideration of the Bill, the Committee is of the opinion that there is a need to cap the interest rates which are currently being experienced by often financially vulnerable users of moneylenders.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>The provisions contained in the Bill are a possible approach to affording borrowers necessary protection in this regard. <\/blockquote> <p>The committee went to state: &quot;The Committee therefore recommends that the Bill, if proceeded with, be amended to include a provision that caps such fees and additional charges&quot;, which is happening.  This committee was highly supportive of the Bill and of a cap but it did not come down on what that cap should be.  I have just read from the committee's report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  There is general agreement across the House on the introduction of a cap and the issue is the precise level of that cap  The annual percentage rate, APR, of interest was mentioned.  While that is not appropriate in this legislation, we are proposing a maximum period of 12 months for loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#C00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1158,"content":"<p>It is not in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#C00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>Many people have talked about the APR of interest in this debate.

Generally, and the Deputy has the same approach, that is why we are sticking with the simple rate based on the original amount, depending on whether the loan is for two months, six months or three years.  We want to limit the loans to 12 months.  That is why APR will never apply.  The Deputy agrees with what I am saying.  It will not be part of the legislation even though it is part of common currency when people talk about these matters.

It is important that the select committee appraises and considers legislation that comes from the Opposition.  I remember when I was in the Opposition not long ago I managed to get many legislative measures to the justice committee but, unfortunately, I could not always get them through that committee because we did not get a money message.  In fairness to the Government, at some stage it must have provided a money message.<\/p> <p>  Everybody here is agreed that the most important thing is that we get the legislation right and that rates of interest for moneylenders are applied properly and fairly.  It needs to be properly regulated and controlled.  Amendment No. 1 is proposing to amend section 93(10)(g).  Subsection (10) deals with the grounds on which the Central Bank may refuse a moneylender's licence.  It can refuse it on one or more of the grounds set out in the subsequent paragraphs.  At present, section 93(10)(g) states that in the bank's opinion the cost of credit to be charged is excessive or any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair.  Deputy Doherty's proposed amendment is that we would leave in the word \"excessive\" but that we would change and enlarge it by inserting that \"the cost of credit is usurious, excessively high or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair\".  When I looked at this first, I wondered how a court would interpret \"usurious\" or \"excessively high\".  In fairness, Deputy Doherty has included that in section 103, but that requires us then to consider amendment No. 3.<\/p> <p>  My view, and I say this with respect to Deputy Doherty, is that the definition set out for \"usurious\" and \"excessively high\" is quite difficult to assess and evaluate.  In the first instance, section 103(1), paragraphs (a) and (b) set out what should be the rate of interest for the first three-year period and in subsection (2) the intention is to refer to a second three-year period but it states \"no later than three years after the coming into operation of this section\" that the terms shall be defined.  I interpret \"no later than three years\" is that it must be within the three years, so there is some overlap between subsections (1) and (2).<\/p> <p>  I also believe we are better off with a situation where the Central Bank can, by regulation, specify exactly the rate of interest that can be applied by moneylenders, and it should be small.  We cannot have situations where exorbitant or usurious, to use Deputy Doherty's word, rates of interest are being applied.  However, once one stitches it into legislation, it is then very difficult to change.  One must go through the process of the Houses changing the legislation whereas if the power is given by regulation to the Minister or the Central Bank in this instance, that can be changed just through statutory instrument.  My view is that we should be careful in terms of the manner by which legislation is enacted.  This will be considered at some stage by a court and lawyers will be arguing about the meaning of usurious and whether it comes within subsections (1) and (2).  I know from my experience introducing Private Members' legislation, and I am sure Deputy Doherty will accept this, that there is an advantage in having the back-up of the Department of Finance, its endless number of advisers, the Office of the Attorney General and all the apparatchiks of the State working on it.  Ultimately, political credit will be decided elsewhere, but the most important thing we have to do is to get it right and make sure the legislation is correct.  For that reason, I go along with what the Minister of State said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#D00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Jim O'Callaghan for his contribution which focused on the definition of the amendment which contains the term \"usurious\".  He rightly pointed out that subsection (2) deals with that issue and defines it as the rates, the simple interest rate or the nominal interest rate.  He made the point then that there is the second step which has different rates and has the term \"no later than three years\", which would mean that the transitional arrangement would cease to exist after three years.  However, the issue of \"no later than three years\" raises the question of whether it could go before that.  Deputy O'Callaghan made the point about having to come back to the House to deal with this.  That is why subsection (7) is in the amendment.  It allows for the Minister to make regulations to adjust restrictions to the cost of credit to the consumer under a moneylending agreement, including those specified in subsections (1) and (2), which are the two subsections the Deputy referred to.  We have tried to deal with that there.  That allows the Minister, if he or she so wished, to change subsections (1) and (2) in terms of the rates or in terms of the period that they take effect.<\/p> <p>  The wider issue here is to get the legislation right, and there are ways of doing that.  As I said, I have been here and done that.  I recognise the Government has legislation now that is going to the House for Second Stage debate.  I am not a fool.  For three years when I was pursuing this legislation, that was not happening.  There was a vehicle here which we put to the Government.  The Government could amend this and do whatever is required, not tie us up with two separate sets of pre-legislative scrutiny and two sets of Committee Stage.  This is going to pass.  There is no way to stop this passing Committee Stage today.  That is the problem we are involved in.  I presume the Minister of State is going to vote it all down, but there is no final vote on Committee Stage of the Bill.  We differ significantly on the rates, but both legislative measures have similar proposals in terms of the amendments.  The Minister of State talked about collection charges, which we will come to momentarily.  The issue of collection charges, as the Minister of State recognises, emanated from the consultation that happened in respect of this legislative measure.<\/p> <p>  There is a big fundamental difference between this Bill and what the Government has before the House, and I am sure the Minister of State is well-briefed on the legislation he is taking before the House.  I will give an example of what my legislation would do for a borrower who borrows &euro;1,000 over a 12-year period.  The interest rate would go from &euro;560 down to &euro;360 in the first three years and down to &euro;180.

It amends section 102(1), which currently provides:<\/p> <blockquote> \tA moneylender shall not make or attempt to make an agreement with a borrower who has borrowed or intends to borrow credit from that moneylender for any sum (other than a collection charge), account of costs, charges or expenses incidental to or relating to the negotiations for, or the granting of, the loan. <\/blockquote> <p>Basically, the amendment takes the words &quot;other than a collection charge&quot; out of the original text.  The amendment to abolish a collection charge in moneylending agreements is made in response to concerns and recommendations of stakeholders prior to and during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in November 2020.  For example, in their submission and opening statement during pre-legislative scrutiny, Dr. Olive McCarthy and Dr. Noreen Byrne recommended that any interest rate restriction be coupled with a limit on other fees and charge to avoid circumvention through other or higher fees and charges.  In her opening statement, Dr. McCarthy noted that although the highest rate currently being charged by moneylenders is 187% APR, collection charges can increase the cost of credit to 287% APR.  Similarly, in its opening statement during pre-legislative scrutiny the Social Finance Foundation, which has done a significant amount of work in this area, recommended that imposing a cap on interest rates charged by moneylenders be coupled with the prohibition of fees and charges.  The amendment acts on these recommendations made in November 2020 by prohibiting collection charges under a moneylending agreement.<\/p><p>As a footnote, I recognise the legislation brought forward by the Minister also incorporated the recommendation that arose during the scrutiny of this legislation in that Bill as published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#F00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>The amendment has the effect of adding collection charges to the list of charges that are prohibited under moneylending agreements.  I am in agreement with the Deputy that collection charges should be prohibited.

I think we are all agreed the exception in respect of collection charges should come out but the Government believes that should be done under the more comprehensive legislation that is currently on its way through the Oireachtas in parallel with this Bill.  The Deputy acknowledged we have agreed on that and it is in the Government legislation.  The Government believes it should be included in the more comprehensive legislation even though we are in complete agreement with the principle behind the amendment.

Let us be clear that the Government's Bill will reduce the cost of a loan of &euro;1,000 by &euro;80 over the period of one year, still leaving interest of &euro;480.  This amendment would reduce the figure by &euro;200 in the first three years and &euro;380 thereafter.  That is what the amendment does.

These sectors are both wide-ranging and valuable and were among those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Employing many hundreds of thousands throughout the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy their leisure time together.  Our cultural institutions and theatres, live performances, tourism destinations, sporting occasions and Gaeltacht communities have all been severely impacted for almost two years.  The public health measures necessitated by Covid enabled us to protect the most vulnerable in our society through our collective action but also had such a negative impact on the way we have lived our lives for the past two years, for example, our ability to watch a match, to attend a live performance, to enjoy a weekend away with friends, to participate in the arts as well as the ability of artists, workers and businesses to provide these uniquely valued experiences.<\/p><p>As Minister, I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society and, with it, our tourism sector, our arts and culture venues and events, and the return of fans to our sports grounds.  The 2022 Revised Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives.  The additional funding covers a wide range of initiatives and measures to support the resilience and growth of practitioners, businesses, communities and operations in the sectors overseen by my Department, with all efforts very much focused on both social and economic recovery.<\/p><p>I will outline total 2022 funding for the sectors supported by my Department.  There is &euro;288.5 million in funding for tourism services in 2022, which is an increase of &euro;67.6 million or 31% on the comparable 2021 allocation<b>.  <\/b>This additional funding includes a &euro;50 million provision for further business continuity support to help drive the sustainable recovery of the sector.  A &euro;35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund will support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.  In addition, &euro;27 million<b><\/b>is allocated for a range of industry initiatives, including domestic marketing and festivals, investment in digital skills development, and staff retention, and &euro;36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development &ndash; an increase of almost &euro;4 million over the 2021 allocation &ndash; for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Some &euro;371.4 million<b><\/b>will be allocated to the arts and culture sector, including &euro;25 million to pilot a new basic income guarantee scheme for artists.  This measure was the key ask from the arts and culture recovery task force and will bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector.  The Arts Council maintains the record &euro;130 million<b><\/b>funding<b><\/b>allocated in 2021, allowing it to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties and empowering it to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead.  Some &euro;50 million is allocated for further supports for the live performance sector following on from the successful operation of a number of schemes in 2021, including the live performance support scheme, LPSS, the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, and the events sector Covid support scheme, ESCSS, thereby supporting a successful return to full-scale performances.<\/p><p>The 2022 allocation for Screen Ireland is &euro;36.7 million, an increase of more than &euro;6.6 million on the 2021 allocation.  The audiovisual industry has been one of the success stories of the past two years and this additional funding will ensure the continued success and growth of this internationally renowned industry into the future.  Funding for this programme area includes the following: &euro;4 million to deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force; &euro;5 million in additional funding for the national cultural institutions to ensure they continue to provide high-quality services to the public and deliver progress in their ongoing programme of investment; and &euro;5 million to support the 2022 commemorative programme delivering rich and diverse national and local programmes marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022.<\/p><p> Funding of &euro;295.7 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2022, which includes &euro;5.5 million for the establishment of the new media commission and the appointment of an online safety commissioner to begin work on key issues following the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill in 2022.  This allocation also provides for an increase of &euro;4.2 million, the largest ever funding increase for TG4, bringing its annual funding for 2022 up to &euro;44.9 million.  This additional funding will allow it to deliver its ambitious post-Covid strategy, focusing on news content and putting audiences centre stage.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I am satisfied the increased allocation for my Department in 2022 of &euro;1.222 billion will allow for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes.  As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to continue to support all the sectors for which I have responsibility as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, and I look forward to their future growth and successes.  I will now hand over to my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak about the Revised Estimates for 2022 as they relate to sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022030900002#A00400","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1333,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and invite the Minister of State to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022030900002#B00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1334,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte mh&oacute;r roimh an deis labhairt leis an gcoiste maidir le Meastach&aacute;in Athbhreithnithe 2022 mar a bhaineann siad le mo r&eacute;imse freagrachta maidir le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sp&oacute;irt agus f&oacute;ill&iacute;ochta.<\/p> <p>  The 2022 allocation for sports and recreational services amounts to &euro;181.2 million and is clear evidence of Government support for the aims of this programme area by contributing to a healthier and more active society by promoting sports participation and supporting high performance and the provision of sport facilities.<\/p> <p>  In the context of sports facilities, the Minister and I recently had the pleasure of announcing an overall package of &euro;150 million in new capital grants under the latest round of the sports capital and equipment programme.  There was a record number of applications for these grants and the Government responded with the most significant level of individual awards ever.

The allocation also provides for increased funding for sports measures via the Dormant Accounts Fund and increased funding for initiatives to attract major sporting events to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The overall 2022 allocation represents a significant investment in sport and builds on the extensive support packages provided to address the Covid-19 challenges to national governing bodies and clubs in 2020 and 2021.

A valuable lesson also is not just about the performers themselves, who of course are incredibly important, but also about the people who make these events happen - those who work backstage on whom the spotlight does not shine.  A light was shone on them, and it is my intention to keep that light firmly there.<\/p> <p>  We could not have designed the number of schemes we did without engagement.  From the first moment I became Minister, engagement and feedback have been key.  Schemes have been adjusted following engagement with those affected.  Although we are emerging from Covid, I would not see that as something that should ever stop.  It is essential that we continue to engage with the stakeholders through the forum that was set up to assess the recovery and their current needs.  Yesterday, we announced another new scheme, which is about helping people with the recovery.  That needs to continue.  Such engagement is evident also in what we are doing with the basic income.  The artists must shape what we do in the Department.  As far as I am concerned, the artists must be involved and at the table in any policy initiatives.

We will then conduct a review of the sports capital programme from this round, and take learnings and get input from the Oireachtas and the broader public as to how we can strengthen it and ensure every part of our grassroots sports system can apply and be enabled to fulfil their ambition.  We expect that to take about two or three months.<\/p> <p>  After that, we will look at a timeline for a further round.  There will be a further round, although I cannot give a definitive answer as to when we will open it.  It is still my intention and that of the Minister to match the ambition in our sporting system and to invest in it.  We will be able to give further details to the committee as we move through the year about when there will be a further round.  As it took ten months to assess the applications for both capital equipment, we cannot commit to an annual round where we can assess and pay out in that period.  It is a multiannual programme and has been that way for many years.  Nevertheless, we appreciate the demand that is there, the ambition in communities and the scale people want, which is why we delivered the &euro;150 million investment this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022030900002#G00500","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1419,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

As can be seen in the Deputy's county, Wexford, and in County Kerry, which I visited in recent days, there is a fair regional spread that reflects not only the population dynamics of the country but also the necessity to invest in rural Ireland and our regions.  The feedback on that has been positive and it has provided a fair balance.<\/p><p>A number of budget lines support people with disabilities.  We are working with Sport Ireland on a new diversity and inclusion policy, which will strengthen the overall policy on people with disabilities when it comes to sport.  We will focus on Activities for All and channel a good deal of funding supports through that.<\/p><p>As for the governing bodies and the core funding they receive, I can give a breakdown but it is complicated.  Under subhead D5, there is significant support through Sport Ireland, with goals for the national governing bodies to support people with disabilities.  Furthermore, we increased the Dormant Accounts Fund from &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million this year, which directly supports people with disabilities.  I am anxious that, with the increase we have secured, we should focus on inclusion and on ensuring everybody in our community can have greater opportunities in sport, and support the grassroots clubs that want to deliver sport for people with disabilities.  I am engaged with some of the sporting organisations, such as the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, and the GAA, regarding how we can deliver better sporting opportunities for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>On the sports capital and equipment programme, we can send further detail to the committee, with a breakdown in respect of some of the governing bodies, such as Special Olympics Ireland and Irish Wheelchair Association Sport.  Moreover, in our new sports action plan, there is a clear focus on people with disabilities.  I am conscious we all engage with people in our local areas who have disabilities.  I often say that if there are three people in the back of a car, there tends not to be the same level of opportunity for the one who may have a disability, whereas the other two siblings will be able to play any of ten sports on a Saturday morning.  In the context of the Football for All events and the significant potential and inclusive nature of events under Activities for All, a clear focus of mine, through additional funding and budget lines we have received this year, will be on people with disabilities and on giving them greater opportunities in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022030900002#G00900","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1423,"content":"<p>In regard to attracting major sporting events to the country, will the Minister of State provide the committee with a breakdown of what is being discussed within the Department and which bodies are involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022030900002#G01000","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":1424,"content":"<p>One of the major events we are discussing at the moment is Euro 2028.

Work is ongoing and we will have to make a final decision before 23 March in respect of submitting an expression of interest.<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government is committed to forming a major events policy.  We will soon carry out a consultation in that regard, trying to engage with the public but also with governing bodies as to what opportunities exist to bring major sporting events to Ireland.  The Ryder Cup is coming in 2027 and there is significant engagement with the Department on that.  From a tourism perspective, too, the Minister is trying to maximise the benefit for Ireland and the region.  The Northwestern versus Nebraska game will be held in August of this year.  That has substantial tourism potential and will bring many visitors from the US, so it is great to see that type of event back up and running.<\/p><p>Regarding women's golf, the Irish Open will return in the autumn this year, which is extremely positive and something we are keen to support.  It will take place in September 2022 in Dromoland Castle.  Those are some of the specific events we are focused on.  Ireland has great potential to do more and in the coming years we want to attract major events that provide a return for the country.  Return on investment is a key metric.

Beyond the periphery of the velodrome, which obviously enables cycling, there are big opportunities for badminton and a range of indoor sports.<\/p> <p>  I forgot to mention that the Cricket World Cup 2030 is coming to Ireland and it will obviously present major opportunities.  There are good relationships between the major events unit, local authorities and other pillars of government.  Unfortunately, we did not get Euro 2020 to come here, but good local structures were established which enabled that collaboration.  Obviously, the Department of Justice and the Garda play a key role as do fans and spectators.  The major events policy will formalise that.
