Once again I welcome the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, and his officials to today's meeting.  I will start with the usual note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.<\/p> <p>  Please note that in order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19 the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to continue wearing face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others.  We ask them to please be respectful of other people's physical space.  They are also asked to adhere to any public health advice.<\/p> <p>  I remind members that, should a vote be called, they must physically come to the committee room in order to vote.  We will now resume consideration of the Bill on amendment No. 140.  As the discussion on the amendment has already taken place, we will go straight to putting the question in a moment.  I remind everybody, including me, that as we move through amendments I will hear from the group of proposers of the amendment and then input from any members of the committee who wish to comment before getting a response from the Minister.  We can then move to putting the question on the amendment.  Amendment No. 140 was discussed with many other amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#A00300","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 141:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, lines 20 and 21, to delete &quot;, and an information session has already taken place&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#A00500","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 142:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, lines 23 and 24, to delete &quot;and no information session has taken place&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#A00700","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 143:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, to delete lines 25 to 28. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#A00900","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 144:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, line 25, to delete &quot;<i>paragraph (a)<\/i>,<i>(b)<\/i>, <i>(c) <\/i>or <i>(d)<\/i>of&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#A01100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 145:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, to delete lines 29 to 34. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#A01300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 146:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, after line 37, to insert the following:  \t&quot;(8) Where no birth information is available, the Authority shall seize all records relating to the relevant person&rsquo;s adoption and\/or illegal birth registration and open an investigation into what transpired.

Amendment No. 152 is very similar to amendments Nos. 148 and 150.

I seek to reassure Deputies now, as I have on a number of similar amendments previously, that we are not just releasing information; we are releasing copies of the records.  This is provided for in relation to birth information, care information and medical information.  It will not just be a summary of what is on the records available but copies of those records.  I do not believe the sections of these amendments seeking to insert the word \"records\" is necessary, as that issue is already provided for.  Copies of records will be provided and that is already provided for throughout the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 154 proposes the provision of a schedule.  Again, I argue that this is covered by section 11(2)(b), which sets out a statement outlining the records and categories of information to be released and which will be issued.

If a parent chose to withhold something from us for whatever reason, bizarre as that may seem, he or she has a right to do so.<\/p> <p>  We are providing for an adopted person to have a legal right to the medical information of somebody else.  That limits the privacy rights of the other person.  If we are to allow that interference with another person's privacy rights, some protections must be provided.  The protections are that the information being given to the adopted person about his or her parent is relevant to the adopted person's health.  Let us be very clear, \"relevant\" is not limited to a question about one illness or disease.  \"Relevant\" means it is relevant to the person's health.  Any genetic or hereditary condition that is on file about the parent falls within the definition of relevant and would be conveyed to the adopted person.<\/p> <p>  The second protection, which we will also cover later, is that this information is not conveyed directly to the adopted person but it would be conveyed to a medical practitioner in order that there will be an intermediary in the provision of such information.  This is not the case when we are talking about the adopted person's own medical records, for which full release is provided, as we discussed earlier.<\/p> <p>  This provision is a dramatic but necessary interference with the privacy rights of the parents in these circumstances.  When the medical information of the parents is shared with somebody else without consent or permission being given, there must be protections around that.  We have engaged significantly with the Office of the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commission, and we have also spoken to mothers.  The mothers who spoke to the committee raised their concerns about their medical information being released.<\/p> <p>  The protections provided are that the information conveyed must be relevant to the adopted person's health, with the word \"relevant\" being interpreted broadly, and that the process will involve the information being given to the adopted person's medical practitioner.  I believe these two safeguards are necessary and will allow for the limitation of the privacy rights of the parent.  This is what we have been advised legally from a data protection position.  It also reflects the concerns about this particular point raised by the mothers who appeared before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I am not able to accept these amendments.  To do so would put at risk the entire goal we are trying to achieve, namely, to enable adopted persons to get health information that is relevant to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#F00700","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>As the Minister said, the term \"relevant\" is always open to interpretation.

One of the key things in this regard, however, is what people might interpret as information &quot;relevant to health&quot;.  As Deputy Ward said, when I read this provision I see it as potentially restrictive.  The Minister, though, has said that he sees this as referring to the health of the person concerned and that he or she should be able to access all of his or her information.  Since the subject access request forms have been available, I have found that my constituents seeking information have achieved a good level of success with them.  I have encountered one or two cases, however, and I have contacted Ms McGarrigle a few times in this regard, where people have received documents where everything has been redacted.  I have come across people who had been looking for records for 40 years and got them and it was fantastic and great that they were able to get that information.  I have also met people, however, who were left much more frustrated when they got ten or 12 pages of information, but where only three or four lines were intelligible because so much was redacted.  In those cases, people tend to ponder what information exists about them because they wonder why so many pages have such little information.<\/p><p>I gave that example to show what can happen when something is potentially left open to interpretation and how one group of officials can respond to a request by deciding to agree to give all the information, while others can refuse and decide they do not believe the person making the request is entitled to the information being sought.  That is why we are so focused on the language of &quot;relevant to the health&quot; of a relevant or qualifying person and this is important.  It reads to me and others as if information may only be relevant if people know what they are looking for.  I refer to a situation where a person might potentially have a diagnosis of cancer or could be going for a battery of tests, but is not yet 100% sure of the prognosis.  It is for that reason that we are so focused on this aspect of the legislation.<\/p><p>The Minister might say something different about this phrasing, but I think it is still open to interpretation.  I do not want to go over everything we have said again, but this is why, similar to what Deputy Bacik said earlier, we believe the provision of information should not be restricted to it being &quot;relevant to the health&quot; of a relevant or qualifying person.  It is, unfortunately, open to interpretation and it would be possible to have very willing and accommodating officials, but, equally, other officials who might think very differently.  That is why we believe this is the opportunity to ensure that the legislation is strengthened in that regard.  If the Minister is of the same belief, I do not see why he could not accept some of the amendments in this grouping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#G01600","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>As I read them, what this group of amendments is seeking to do is to remove the requirement to provide the relevant medical information to the relevant medical practitioner, who will then provide it to the relevant person.  I see that as what this set of amendments aims to do.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Deputy's point concerning consistency in this context, she is right that it is vital and that is why there is the ability to publish guidelines under this legislation and for those guidelines to be revised if elements of inconsistency are seen to be creeping into the application of the legislation.  This aspect is fundamentally important.  A later set of amendments seeks to limit the power to issue guidelines and I will be opposing those as well.  Guidelines are the manner in which we can see the achievement of the required consistency.<\/p> <p>  This set of amendments is concerned with deleting the second level of protection in respect of interference with the privacy rights of a parent.  The first level of protection is the provision that the information requested is relevant information about the adopted person's health and the second level protection is that the information is conveyed to the medical practitioner.  We have been advised that these are the necessary measures to balance the significant interference in the privacy rights of the parent.  It is worth repeating that we are giving the adopted person a legal right to access the medical information of another person, without that other person's consent.  It is a big step.  It must be taken, but it is a big step and some level of protection must be put in place.

The Bill provides for an information meeting with adopted people aged between 16 and 18 years who have applied for their information.

It should not be conducted by a social worker and the person holding the meeting should not attempt to influence the adopted person in any way.  If the adopted person requests emotional or psychological support, it should be provided by a service of his or her choosing, as we have set out for section 18.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#J00700","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>We made a decision when bringing forward this legislation that we did not want to define just for those people aged 18 and above and we wanted to recognise that younger people who were adopted also have an interest in their birth and early life information.  We wanted to make provision for that.  Issues are different when we are not dealing with adults and we engaged quite significantly.  In particular, we consulted with the Ombudsman for Children to ensure the appropriate provisions were put into the Bill and the section we are discussing here has been developed in consultation with the children's ombudsman.  The Ombudsman for Children has confirmed that the supportive meeting we are proposing in this Bill that allows for the release of information for those who are aged 16 and 17 is a necessary protection for younger people.<\/p> <p>  Under section 18 of the Bill, a person aged 16 or 17 seeking identity information will have that information released through a supportive meeting with the help of a suitably qualified person.  In addition, the applicant - the adopted person seeking the information - may be accompanied by a person of his or her choosing.  The meeting can take place in person or virtually as preferred.  This mechanism is designed to ensure there is an additional layer of support available to younger applicants and those who are not adults at the point of receiving and assimilating the information.  Given the clear opinion of the Ombudsman for Children on the provision, I will not accept an amendment that seeks to remove such a meeting.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 204 suggests that nobody in the meeting should try to influence the relevant person in any way with respect to his or her view on the adoption.  This language is very imprecise and it is unclear what constitutes influence.  It is defined in such a way that virtually any interaction between the younger person and the suitably qualified person could be construed as influence.  Again, matters relating to the conduct of these meetings can be dealt with through guidance and guidelines rather than through statutory provision.<\/p> <p>  A second element of amendment No. 204 requires that a person facilitating a supportive meeting should provide details of emotional or psychological supports upon request.  Again, that provision of support to relevant persons is already provided for under section 57 of the Bill.<\/p><p>We do not feel it necessary to repeat it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#J00800","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 203:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:   \t&ldquo;(2) Where the relevant person does not wish to have a meeting the records and provided items shall be provided to the relevant person via post or electronically.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#K00500","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 204:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(2) During the meeting referred to in <i>subsection (1)(a), <\/i>the designated person shall not try to influence the relevant person in any way in relation to the relevant person&rsquo;s views on their adoption.

For example, if a relative of a deceased adopted person has cancer and as a result had applied for a family medical history, according to the Bill only medical information relating to cancer will be given.  What if information in relating to heart disease or another medical condition is available on the file?  I believe I have discussed this already with the Minister and I am repeating myself.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 232 to 234, inclusive, concern the provision that only information that is relevant to the health of the relevant person will be released.  Amendment No. 233 removes the requirement for the information to be provided to the medical practitioner.  The Department's data protection impact assessment states that this measure is necessary in order to mitigate the risks of a genetic relative being identified.  However, as any identifying information will already have been removed, the requirement to release the information to a medical practitioner is completely unnecessary.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 235 ensures the location of all medical information that is available on file.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 236 ensures that a person with expertise in reading documents is involved in the process.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 240 and 241 widen the definition of a record by including that which relates to any relevant person and in section 2 the Bill defines a relevant person as someone who may apply to Tusla for information.

This originates in the understandable distrust adopted people and survivors have for State bodies.  They are seeking the assurance of as broad a definition as possible to prevent the lack of access they have been presented with for decades.  These amendments seek to insert such broader definitions.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 247 seeks to remove the entirely inappropriate and ambiguous term &quot;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&quot;.  We must call that phrase out as a get-out clause.  It is a worrying element of the Bill, which does not provide unfettered access, as everybody keeps claiming it does.  It is a barrier, plain and simple.  At a previous meeting, the Minister assured us that all of this Bill was carefully fine-tuned in accordance with engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General, which was integral to the Bill.  The phrase &quot;to the extent that it is practicable to do so&quot; is far from finely tuned and it is important to point that out.  I hope I am wrong but there is no doubt in my mind that such a phrase in the legislation will be used as an obstacle for people using their personal information.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 seek to remove another restrictive aspect of the Bill.  The amendments remove the option for the relevant body to provide what is essentially a summary or list of information and insist on the provision of the full range of records held about the applicant.  If this Bill is about enabling full and complete access, this is another section that needs changing.<\/p><p>Similarly, amendments Nos. 250 and 251 remove the relational statement &quot;a record of such class as the Minister may prescribe&quot; and replace it to provide for absolute statements that allow full access to records and personal data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#M01900","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>This group of amendments relates to section 27 under Part 4.  That section provides for the release of the birth information of a child who died in an institution to a qualifying relative.  This speaks again to an issue that came up during the pre-legislative scrutiny process about information relating to children who died in institutions.  That was not provided for under the original draft that was recommended in the pre-legislative scrutiny and we are providing for that now.<\/p> <p>  Section 27 relates to birth information about children who died.  The amendment seeks to expand the definition of \"birth information\" to include the other categories but it is important to remember that those other categories are all covered by the next set of sections.  Sections 27 to 30, inclusive, provide for the release of birth information, early life information and care information, the successive types of information about children who died in institutions.  The type of information the amendment is seeking to insert into the section is addressed in subsequent sections and, therefore, we do not feel it needs to be repeated by including particular definitions in this section.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 relate to issues we have addressed previously.  We are looking for a statement to be released along with the documents explaining the documents as they are released.  The alternative that has been proposed in a number of places is the idea of a schedule.  We believe that the statement, which is not just a list, like a schedule, but actually gives some context to the documents being proposed, is a better way forward.  That is why on each occasion the issue comes up, we believe the provision of a statement alongside the release of documents is better than the provision of a schedule.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised concern about the use of the term \"to the extent that it is practicable to do so\".  That is a term of art in legislation.  It is intended to convey an obligation to provide copies of all records unless there is some significant obstacle to the provision of those particular records.  An example would be where an original record is lost.  We know there are situations where information will not be with Tusla or the AAI and that is going to be a difficulty when it comes to certain adopted people for whom there will be no information to provide them with because of historical circumstances.  <\/p> <p>  I will give the Deputy another example of the use of the term \"to the extent that it is practicable to do so\".  During the pandemic, electronic records were easily provided to people but hard copy records were not as accessible because people were not attending to collect them.  The SARs we have been issuing from our Department have meant the release of the electronic document which, for the commission's archive, is the vast majority of the information.  However, in answer to each SAR, the Department has stated it will also undertake a search of any physical documents that are in the commission archive.  It is in such a situation that \"to the extent that it is practicable to do so\" is used.  The core goal and intent behind this legislation is for the full release of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#M02000","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>The Minister said the information around relevant bodies is covered in a subsequent section and that is great, if I take him at his word.

There should be an overwhelming obligation on the authority and agency to carry out the tracing functions under this Bill without interfering in the lives of people affected.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 288 is significant in adding a much broader range of bodies to which the Minister can issue guidelines for the purposes of tracing.  Currently, this only applies to the agency or the authority whereas our amendment will incorporate the range of State and religious actors outlined in section 34(6), such as Departments, the HSE, the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland.

It is, in part, to respond to some of the recommendations of the special rapporteur's report on illegal birth registration and to give additional powers to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the set of amendments that have been proposed, the provisions of the Bill allow for a tracing service and provide a statutory underpinning for a tracing service, a statutory underpinning that has been missing up to this point.  It has meant that tracing is far more difficult for anybody, be it Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, to undertake.  First, it is important to say that by giving tracing a statutory underpinning we will significantly improve the ability of these bodies to engage with other State bodies.  Right now, GDPR is immediately used as a barrier to the exchange of information.  The statutory obligation to share information with Tusla and the AAI will facilitate the provision of this information.  It is also important to recognise that these are the bodies that have expertise and skill in tracing.  We are very clear that we want people to be able to get the benefit of a tracing service immediately.  It is important to say that these are the agencies with that level of expertise at present.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the specific amendments, we believe what is proposed in amendment No. 269 is already sufficiently provided for under this section.  In response to amendment No. 288, our view is that it is unnecessary as the guidelines are only relevant to the authority and agency in providing tracing services and they do not need to be expanded to include bodies from which the authority and agency can request information.  Those bodies do not have functions under this Part, only an obligation to comply with a request for information made in the context of a trace.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 274 is contrary to the policy intention of the legislation.  Section 33 is an important provision to cover a potential situation where people must be traced and contacted with important information.  To remove that reference could be detrimental should that situation arise.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 268 and 270, I cannot see the necessity for those amendments.  They would actually hinder the ability to provide a timely and efficient service.  Amendment No. 268 seeks to remove the ability to refer to the contact preference register in the provision of a tracing service by either the agency or the authority and it does not provide for an alternative process.  The decision to include this provision in the legislation was carefully considered.  The ability to check a contact preference on the contact preference register is a very important part of how the tracing service will operate.  First, in a scenario where a trace has been initiated and the preference for contact is found to be on the register, then it is possible to immediately and efficiently proceed to the facilitation of whatever level of contact has been proffered by both parties, including up to a reunion or a sharing of information.  It would avoid the need to go through a protracted tracing process if they can immediately refer to what is set out by parties on the contact preference register.  Second, in a situation where a trace has been initiated and the preference for no contact is found on the register, this information is conveyed to the person who requested the trace and the person can decide whether or not to proceed.  In both scenarios, by providing that the data on the register can be processed as part of the trace, the process is made more efficient.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 270 seeks to place restrictions on the manner in which the tracing service operates.  During the drafting process, my officials and I engaged with the organisations currently providing tracing services.<\/p><p>We requested their assistance in identifying the bodies from which information requests would be crucial to the provision of an effective and timely tracing service.  As far as we are aware, the current non-statutory tracing service encounters very significant difficulties, delays and obstructions in the provision of its service due to the fact it cannot request key information from other bodies such as those listed in this legislation.<\/p><p> The purpose of section 34 is to ensure the tracing service provided under this legislation can operate in the most efficient manner possible and, therefore, accepting this amendment would be contrary to that goal and it would undermine that particular intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#O02100","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I understand the need for the immediacy of this and the question of a different agency for information that is not Tusla.  The aim is not to slow the process for people getting information, and this is something we have discussed at great length in the committee.  When witnesses came before the committee we heard that people were not just traumatised by interactions with Tusla but really retraumatised as well.  There were stories of people sitting in front of social workers with their information in front of them, including birth name and the name of a mother and father.  This is information that people have wanted to know for their entire life but even though the staff could have several pieces of information, they would not tell these people any of it.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about this a lot because none of us wanted to delay the process of people accessing their information.  I request that the Minister and his Department give this consideration before the next Stage.  Something must change in the way Tusla interacts with people who have been affected.  Perhaps it could be a different department.  Could we give this some consideration before the next Stage because it is really important?  We must figure out a way that does not slow the process but we really cannot ignore it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#P00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>As the Minister stated, we support the statutory underpinning of a tracing service and the provision of that statutory underpinning.  The need for that was made clear.  As Deputy Cairns said, the experience of Tusla of many of the witnesses who came before the committee was very negative.  I look again at our recommendations Nos. 56 and 57 in the pre-legislative scrutiny report, where we indicated the dissatisfaction in experiences with Tusla and the AAI, and the need to ensure improvements in resourcing, culture and legal structure.  There was also a recommendation that a new agency would carry out functions assigned and that interim arrangements would be made.  These amendments are proposed in that spirit and in recognition of what we heard at committee meetings.  The amendments deserve consideration.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has made a very significant indication that he will table amendments on Report Stage on the delivery of specialised placing services in the context of illegal birth registrations.  We probably all want a little more clarity on what those amendments would look like.  Is it envisaged, for example, that there would be any provision for a criminal investigation or is it much more about the tracing of the birth?  From the brave testimonies of people who have come forward and been the subject of illegal adoption, we are all conscious that the tracing in the context of these adoptions would be a much more difficult process because there were falsified records in some cases.  Attempts were made to cover up in others.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister outline exactly what will the specialised tracing look like at this stage?  If anybody is affected by this, what should they expect in the context of Tusla's specialised tracing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#P00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Cairns.  I have also heard from and met people who were adopted and subject to illegal birth registration.  I have heard their very real and deep frustration with processes and how they were treated as individuals.  I am very aware of that.  I have said in these hearings on a number of occasions that we must change the culture in these organisations.  We will do this in a number of ways.<\/p> <p>  First, we must amend the law because the law does not facilitate the proper release of information.  That is why we are bringing forward this legislation and we believe it crucial in beginning that change.  We are bringing forward guidelines to ensure and copper-fasten that culture of release of information and the presumption of release.  That culture will be reinforced through the process of the implementation group led by my Department, ensuring alignment between our departmental review of the open release of information and that this is replicated across Tusla and the AAI.<\/p> <p>  This is also supported by resources.  We have discussed in the context of the budget an extra &euro;3 million for Tusla specifically to support the implementation of the information and tracing Bill this year and an extra &euro;1 million for the AAI, again to do that work.  Both of those bodies are hiring relevant staff and securing new expertise within their ranks to implement what is happening here.<\/p> <p>  there is also the provision in the legislation for a review of its operation.  It is entirely possible that in future a decision could be taken to entirely remove the provision of tracing from certain bodies.  The point I made in particular when we discussed this on Second Stage related to the suggestion of a creation of a new agency.  I know the recommendation was made in good faith by the committee but to attempt that now would delay the availability of the provisions in this legislation.<\/p> <p>  In changing the law and culture and by providing the resources, we can change the experience that adopted people have in terms of their engagement with Tusla.  I know the committee has had Mr. Bernard Gloster before it but I do not know if members discussed this particular point with him.  I regularly discuss this matter with Mr. Gloster both in the context of our quarterly meetings and, for various reasons, when I am on the phone to him regularly.  This is a core matter.  It may be useful for the committee to hear from him as chief executive on the work he is doing within the organisation to bring about this culture change.  I know many adopted people are not reassured and will not be reassured until they see change.  Perhaps it is the same for the committee.  It might be useful, rather than hearing it from me, to hear it directly from the chief executive.<\/p> <p>  I made a point regarding the tabling of an amendment on Report Stage and Deputy Bacik is correct.  Illegal birth registration is extremely hard to prove.  The reason is it is an illegal act and the person or persons perpetrating that act would have done their best to cover their tracks.  I do not know why but the people who engaged in this illegal act in St. Patrick's Guild did not cover their tracks but drew attention to the acts on the cover of the files by indicating adoption for birth.  That allowed the investigation to take place.<\/p> <p>  We will table an amendment that will expand section 33, allowing a Minister to request the review of files in certain circumstances.  This is primarily dealing with cases where an individual has no idea he or she is subject to an illegal birth registration.  As the Deputy knows, the legislation provides a route for people with a suspicion to go through but where Tusla, in particular, identifies a file about which it has very significant concerns, the amendment will allow a Minister direct the agency to undertake further tracing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#P00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The objective of the amendment is to maintain the existing national contact preference register.

Section 42 enables the existence of a single contact preference register once the existing data have been transferred and six months have elapsed after the date on which the section comes into operation.  Rather than creating no ambiguity, as was suggested, it would copper-fasten ambiguity, as we would have two contact preference registers in existence at the same time, so that would cause confusion, but it would also be a clear breach of the GDPR, in particular Article 25 on data protection by design and by default.  Article 25 is clear that unnecessary data should not be retained.

The amendments spoken to by the Deputy relate specifically to adding text regarding not interfering with the GDPR rights of relevant persons or parents.  I reassure members that it is not the intention of the Bill to, and, more importantly, the Bill does not in any way, interfere with a person's right to apply for their information through a subject access request.  The Bill does contain a limited limitation of GDPR rights.  That is inherent in what we are trying to do here because the right of another party to not accept the processing of their information, which is provided for under GDPR at the moment, will not be available to people seeking to prevent the release of their information to an adopted person.  It is that limitation that is provided for.  If these amendments are accepted to say GDPR applies as normal at all times, it will undermine the very limited exception to GDPR that we have provided here, which ensures no one can prevent an adopted or boarded out person getting access to their information.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 327 relates to Part 9, which provides for an information campaign.  It relates to the right to access information and the right to rectification for mothers and fathers.  It is a response to my consultation with parents but particularly with mothers.  I know that some of that group also engaged with the committee.  The amendment will ensure that a mother or father's right to access information about themselves held by an institution and, importantly, the right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete information under GDPR is highlighted to them as part of the information campaign that will be run for three months on enactment of this legislation.  When I spoke to individuals they were not aware of some of the existing rights available to them under GDPR.  There was a particular concern if, say, derogatory comments or untrue information about the context of their pregnancy were placed on the file.  This mandates within the information campaign that these rights of access but also rectification will be conveyed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#T03600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 312:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 43, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(3) When the National Memorial and Records Centre is established, a primary information source shall make arrangements for the transfer of all relevant records to the National Memorial and Records Centre.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#T03800","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 313:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 43, to delete lines 20 to 22. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#T04000","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Section 44 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646784000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>SECTION 45<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 314:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 43, line 28, to delete &ldquo;if directed by the Authority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;whether or not it has been directed by the Authority&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>This places a requirement on the data controller to ensure that every effort is made to ensure that all relevant record holders transfer their files to the AAI in order that they can be made available to affected people regardless of whether they have been requested.

Through consultation and engagement with those impacted by illegal birth registration, I understand that for some people this declaration now poses a challenge and causes discomfort given they know about their birth of origin.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 325 seeks to address this directly and is in line with the recommendations from the interdepartmental group on the St. Patrick's Guild incorrect birth registrations.  The amendment will provide assurance that contracts, legal documents and any acts undertaken in good faith will not be invalidated or that the persons affected will not experience any adverse consequences simply because they were the subject of an incorrect birth registration.  This assurance will apply both retrospectively and prospectively.  It does apply retrospectively, however, which is important; that is, prior to the passing of legislation and before the affected person discovered his or her birth was incorrectly registered.<\/p><p> I also intend to bring amendments on Report Stage to deal with the issue of succession in respect of persons affected by illegal birth registration.  This issue was raised by the interdepartmental group I established last year to address issues arising for people affected by illegal birth registration.  Since then, I have been liaising with the Minister for Justice on amendments to the Succession Act 1965, which falls within the competence of the Department of Justice.  These amendments will ensure that people affected by illegal birth registrations would, for the purposes of succession and inheritance, be deemed to be the children of their social parents.  It is proposed that the amendments will be carried in the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, again, so affected persons can benefit from them as quickly as possible.  That amendment will be brought forward on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030900002#U04000","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's indication of those future amendments.

One reason is distrust of State agencies and bodies, and people's experience for decades of being treated in that way.

This Bill was published back in 2018.  It is an ambition of my party's and mine that the excessive charges that are being applied by moneylenders to, in some regards, very vulnerable people are dealt with.  We should not be allowing the type of rates that are applying.  While we have had support at different levels, including on Second Stage, there is a clear kind of cat-and-mouse game, which I think is disappointing for the body politic, because sometimes this committee works well.  We have a piece of legislation that was published four years ago, it comes to Committee Stage and, just like that, we have the Government then publishing its own piece of legislation and taking it to Second Stage before this week is out.  That is disappointing because we hear sometimes that we all work together and all of this, but it does not always work like that, at least when it comes to a Bill that we have produced.  It is not the first time.  We have seen the same with the lobbying Bill and we have seen it with other pieces of legislation.  That being said, I am very grateful to all of the people and, particularly, our witnesses, who contributed during pre-legislative scrutiny to this piece of legislation, which has improved and shaped the amendments that we put forward.  I note that some of the issues that were discussed in relation to my Bill in pre-legislative scrutiny have found their way into the Government&rsquo;s Bill.

I have a note that combines this amendment with amendment No. 3 and if the Vice Chairman is happy to do it, I can deal with amendments Nos. 1 and 3 together because they are connected.  When taken with amendment No. 3, I must oppose amendment No. 1 on the basis that it does not represent the most effective way to cap the interest charged on moneylending loans.  I do not say this to be obstructive but because officials in the Department of Finance considered this approach of tying the cap to the licensing framework, and this method was included in the general scheme of that Bill last July.  Essentially, the Government's approach last July was similar.  However, in the meantime, and with the benefit of the involvement of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting, the Government Bill published recently refined its approach. <\/p><p>Section 93(10) provides for the grounds for refusal to grant a licence only and it would therefore have no effect once a licence has been granted.  The rates proposed to be charged in the licensing process must accord with the caps under the Government Bill, but it also goes much further.  The Government Bill now makes the cap a standalone requirement in respect of each loan offered, as opposed to the original licence application, and it makes it an offence for a moneylender to provide a loan above that rate.  This is more straightforward and meaningful for individual customers as it is a requirement in respect of each loan and not a general matter considered with regard to the licensing process. <\/p><p>From the consumer's perspective - many of these people are vulnerable people who have had to borrow in a difficult position - in dealing with the loan and asking people with an issue to go back to how a licence was granted to the institution in question is very complex and it would be a very difficult process.  We are linking the interest rate to each individual loan, saying that under the licence it would be an offence to charge above the rate in respect of that loan.<\/p><p>The setting of the numerical values of the rates in subsections (1) and (2) is also at odds with the power of the Minister to adjust the rates by regulation under subsection (7).  We also consider this significant as asking the Minister to adjust rates by regulation would not conform with original numerical values set in primary legislation.  There could be a difficulty if regulations were not in exact conformity with primary legislation.  Again, I say this as the Government's drafting process has benefited from engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and there is a risk that the method proposed by the Deputy would constitute an amendment of primary legislation by way of secondary legislation, which would be <i>ultra vires<\/i>the authority of the Minister under secondary legislation.  We have had the benefit over recent months of refining and examining what we think is the most legally sound basis to deal with the matter.<\/p><p>With regard to the level of the rates themselves, while lower interest rates are of course the preference for consumers, there is a need for balance in setting the ceilings to ensure consumers do not face the difficulty of having to go without credit where providers leave the market either suddenly or en masse.  We have had some withdrawals from the market.  The moneylending industry remains an important source of credit for a significant number of people.  The rates proposed for the first three years and the period thereafter set a rigid approach, which presupposes the level of reduction that the market can take in three years' time without any analysis and which would require primary legislation to amend in any event.<\/p><p>The Government Bill, in contrast, sets ceilings above which the cap can be set and provides for the Minister to have regard to a number of principles and policies set down in the primary legislation when making regulations to set the specific caps.  This provides more flexibility to amend the caps in response to relevant policy factors while ensuring that the rate can never be set at such a level as to make it an artificial cap.  The Government Bill also incorporates the consultation with the Central Bank which the Deputy and the committee favours.<\/p><p>The legislation passed Second Stage in December 2018 and in May 2021 there was a consultation process.  In June 2021, Deputy Doherty made a submission to the committee outlining that he would move away from the annual percentage rate cap to an index cap on the total cost of credit over a timeframe of three years.  In November the Oireachtas committee published a report of detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  Deputy Doherty has proposed amendments to the Bill to cap interest rates, including a similar calculation method but at a lower level than what the Government is proposing.  His method of implementing the cap does not make it an offence to offer credit above the rate and it links to the licensing process rather than the individual loans.  It is one of the key issues and it is something we want in the separate legislation that has been published and will be discussed in the D&aacute;il separately later today.  We will deal with the interest charged on loans during the lifetime of a licence rather than referring back to the licence.  People should be able to understand the interest rate they are being charged on a loan but asking people to go back and check the licence as issued by the Central Bank several years earlier, and them trying to work it out on that basis, would be very difficult for many people.<\/p><p>I commend the Deputy on raising this matter and there is consensus in dealing with this but because of the passage of time we have had the advantage of input from the Parliamentary Counsel, scrutiny provided by the Oireachtas and the involvement of the Central Bank and Attorney General.  It is about improving what is a very important issue and everybody agrees with the principle of what the Deputy is proposing.  We hold the view that enhanced legislation published by the Government is more comprehensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#B00100","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has spoken to amendment No. 3 so I will make the following point.  If the Government was willing to work with me as the sponsor of this legislation over the past four years, there would have been a different approach.  A contracts Bill was passed unanimously by the Houses of the Oireachtas and I was a sponsor of that, and there was also legislation relating to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which saw real engagement.  Through all the process, and even when the Government put forward its proposals, we offered amendments to try to sharpen the legislation.  Often, these are rejected but on a number of occasions amendments have been accepted or the Minister has agreed to sharpen the legislation as a result on Report Stage.  That approach was not taken by the Government with this legislation and the Government is more interested in having its moneylender Bill.<\/p> <p>  That said, I do not give a damn whose stamp is on the legislation at the end of the day.  The Minister of State speaks of dealing with drafting issues and the benefit of the Attorney General or other advices, which we do not have.  As an Opposition party, we nonetheless expect the process evident in two other pieces of legislation that have been enacted would be seen here.  Unfortunately, that did not happen over four years with this legislation.<\/p> <p>  That said, outside the drafting issues there is a core issue in the Government's Bill, which is that it does not do enough.  It barely scratches the surface on the question of moneylending.  The Minister of State mentioned that people would not have credit and all the rest.  The largest moneylender in this country left the State, as it had hundreds of thousands of customers and many of them were intergenerational.  What did the Government do to create awareness in those consumers about where they could get credit?  Point me to one initiative or press release.  Point me to anything the Government did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#B00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":688,"content":"<p>A major player may have left the market but there are still 36 licensed operators in the market, with 32 actively providing credit in the market.

Many of them are unique and catalogue operators and not lenders that provide loans to cover the communion or birthday party costs.  I am glad the officials are starting to brief the Minister of State on this big issue.  The Government did not do anything on this.  It should have introduced an initiative to encourage the customers of that largest moneylender in the State to go to the credit union where they could get lower cost loans at a fraction of the cost charged by the moneylenders.  That has not happened.  The Government took a hands-off approach in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As amendment No. 3 is being discussed with amendment No. 1, amendment No. 3 proposes to delete section 103 of the principal Act, which sets out collection charges, which would be abolished under amendment No. 2, if they were to be administered.  That is what the original section provided.  The proposed new section 103 would provide for a cap on the rate of interest moneylenders are permitted to charge.  The interest rate cap would be based on simple interest with an initial cap which would then be reduced further after a period of three years.  It would also separate cash loans from loans provided on a running account.  The new interest rate cap as it applies to cash loans would be as follows: a simple interest rate of no more than 0.75% per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum for a period of three years, which is the initial cap in the proposed amendment.  It is proposed there would a simple interest rate of no more than 0.35% per week, which is a reduced rate, up to a maximum of 18% per annum after a period of three years.  That would be the secondary reduced cap.<\/p> <p>  The impact of this cap for borrowers with reference to a &euro;1,000 cash loan over a 12-month term by a credit union compared with the largest moneylender in the State, which the Government should have done something about when Provident pulled out of the market, would be that the total repayments on the loan would be &euro;1,060.  The borrower would be charged &euro;60 in interest.  A moneylender would charge the borrower &euro;1,560, which is &euro;560 in interest.  The ratio of interest charged by the moneylender compared with the credit union is nine times more.  The initial cap proposed in the amendment would be mean the &euro;560 in interest that would be charged would be reduced to &euro;360.  The ratio of interest charged compared with the credit union would be six times more, which is still an very expensive type of credit.  The secondary cap we propose would reduce the initial moneylender's interest from &euro;560 to &euro;180, bringing the ratio between what a credit union would charge compared with a moneylender after three years down to 1:3.<\/p> <p>  Crucially for the moneylender, the total interest payable does not include the impact of collection charges, which we deal with in amendment No. 2.  Those collection charges push up the cost of credit much further.  Therefore, this cap would slash the total cost of credit a moneylender can charge by more than one third and the further cap that would be in place after three years would slash it by more than two thirds.  That would radically reduce the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, thereby protecting consumers, many of whom are vulnerable to vicious cycles of debt, and reduce the interest they are charged.<\/p> <p>  Further provisions of amendment No. 3 require the Central Bank to produce a report at least every three years assessing the cost of credit in the moneylender market and to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance, where they are warranted, to protect the interests of consumers.  There is a requirement for the Central Bank to produce a report within three years.  This is about sending a very clear signal that we are reducing the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, including abolishing collection charges and, after a three-year period, that cost will reduce further.  That is what is necessary to protect people.  It is not what the Minister of State has just told the committee, namely, that if your moneylender has gone, you should go to one of the other 100 moneylenders.  That is not what we need.<\/p> <p>  Most of the reports that comprise studies that have been done in this sector show people who go to moneylenders can access credit from credit unions.  A large number of them also access credit from credit unions.  The issue is the convenience, the door-to-door sales, the fact the operator knows Sheila has John and Mary at home and John is about to make his first holy communion, or that people are asked on their doorstep if they are going on holidays.  The issue is the in-your-face sales because of the convenience and short-term nature of the loans, as a result of which people get trapped into a cycle of high interest rate debt.  I strongly commend amendment No. 1 to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#C00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I understand what the Deputy has said.  One of the key elements of what we propose builds on the original legislation, the Private Members&rsquo; bill drafted some time ago.  It goes without saying that the longer the period a person has a loan from one of these moneylenders, the more interest he or she will pay over time.  One of the proposals we suggest is the loan would be restricted to 12 months.  That would reduce the amount of interest people would pay over a period of time rather than having loans with a significant high interest rate running for a period of two or three years.<\/p><p>Second, we believe the issue of the credit unions in this regard is vital.  I think we are all <i>ad idem<\/i>on that with respect to credit unions providing more unsecured loans, which they are very good at doing.  It is the biggest sector in the economy providing unsecured loans.  I will be meeting the credit union movement tomorrow to encourage it to lend more in that area given it has such a big footprint with approximately 400 branches around the country.<\/p><p>Up to now, many moneylenders have charged for the door-to-door collection of money.  Every time a moneylender sends somebody out to collect money, that incurs an expensive charge.  The moneylender can charge &euro;40, &euro;50 or &euro;60 for a visit.  We are banning that practice.  All the operator's costs will have to come in under the interest rate.<\/p><p>The views behind the Private Members' Bill are well motivated and are all in the right place, but there are significant extra items that could and should be taken into account regarding this issue and that is why the Government published its legislation.  The Government approved the heads of the Bill last year.  It is not something that has just emerged now.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the Government's proposed legislation was carried out by this committee last October.  Having completed that process last autumn, we listed it as priority legislation on 21 January of this year.  The final text of the Bill was agreed with the Attorney General in mid-February.  It was approved by Government quite recently and has now been published.  The Second Stage debate on the Bill is scheduled for later today.<\/p><p>Overall, the theme behind what the Deputy and the Government are saying is similar but the Government probably has had the advantage of the extra time and extra pre-legislative scrutiny, the excellent paper produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on the Government's proposal, and the benefit of the Attorney General, the Central Bank and the various organisations that made submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  We believe our legislation, as proposed, is the best way to move forward.<\/p><p>When this committee considered the detailed scrutiny of the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018, the Bill before us, some time ago, it was clear in its report when it stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBased on its consideration of the Bill, the Committee is of the opinion that there is a need to cap the interest rates which are currently being experienced by often financially vulnerable users of moneylenders.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>The provisions contained in the Bill are a possible approach to affording borrowers necessary protection in this regard. <\/blockquote> <p>The committee went to state: &quot;The Committee therefore recommends that the Bill, if proceeded with, be amended to include a provision that caps such fees and additional charges&quot;, which is happening.  This committee was highly supportive of the Bill and of a cap but it did not come down on what that cap should be.  I have just read from the committee's report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  There is general agreement across the House on the introduction of a cap and the issue is the precise level of that cap  The annual percentage rate, APR, of interest was mentioned.  While that is not appropriate in this legislation, we are proposing a maximum period of 12 months for loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#C00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>It is not in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#C00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Many people have talked about the APR of interest in this debate.

Generally, and the Deputy has the same approach, that is why we are sticking with the simple rate based on the original amount, depending on whether the loan is for two months, six months or three years.  We want to limit the loans to 12 months.  That is why APR will never apply.  The Deputy agrees with what I am saying.

It is important that the select committee appraises and considers legislation that comes from the Opposition.  I remember when I was in the Opposition not long ago I managed to get many legislative measures to the justice committee but, unfortunately, I could not always get them through that committee because we did not get a money message.  In fairness to the Government, at some stage it must have provided a money message.<\/p> <p>  Everybody here is agreed that the most important thing is that we get the legislation right and that rates of interest for moneylenders are applied properly and fairly.  It needs to be properly regulated and controlled.  Amendment No. 1 is proposing to amend section 93(10)(g).  Subsection (10) deals with the grounds on which the Central Bank may refuse a moneylender's licence.  It can refuse it on one or more of the grounds set out in the subsequent paragraphs.  At present, section 93(10)(g) states that in the bank's opinion the cost of credit to be charged is excessive or any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair.  Deputy Doherty's proposed amendment is that we would leave in the word \"excessive\" but that we would change and enlarge it by inserting that \"the cost of credit is usurious, excessively high or any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair\".  When I looked at this first, I wondered how a court would interpret \"usurious\" or \"excessively high\".  In fairness, Deputy Doherty has included that in section 103, but that requires us then to consider amendment No. 3.<\/p> <p>  My view, and I say this with respect to Deputy Doherty, is that the definition set out for \"usurious\" and \"excessively high\" is quite difficult to assess and evaluate.  In the first instance, section 103(1), paragraphs (a) and (b) set out what should be the rate of interest for the first three-year period and in subsection (2) the intention is to refer to a second three-year period but it states \"no later than three years after the coming into operation of this section\" that the terms shall be defined.  I interpret \"no later than three years\" is that it must be within the three years, so there is some overlap between subsections (1) and (2).<\/p> <p>  I also believe we are better off with a situation where the Central Bank can, by regulation, specify exactly the rate of interest that can be applied by moneylenders, and it should be small.  We cannot have situations where exorbitant or usurious, to use Deputy Doherty's word, rates of interest are being applied.  However, once one stitches it into legislation, it is then very difficult to change.  One must go through the process of the Houses changing the legislation whereas if the power is given by regulation to the Minister or the Central Bank in this instance, that can be changed just through statutory instrument.  My view is that we should be careful in terms of the manner by which legislation is enacted.  This will be considered at some stage by a court and lawyers will be arguing about the meaning of usurious and whether it comes within subsections (1) and (2).  I know from my experience introducing Private Members' legislation, and I am sure Deputy Doherty will accept this, that there is an advantage in having the back-up of the Department of Finance, its endless number of advisers, the Office of the Attorney General and all the apparatchiks of the State working on it.  Ultimately, political credit will be decided elsewhere, but the most important thing we have to do is to get it right and make sure the legislation is correct.  For that reason, I go along with what the Minister of State said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#D00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Jim O'Callaghan for his contribution which focused on the definition of the amendment which contains the term \"usurious\".  He rightly pointed out that subsection (2) deals with that issue and defines it as the rates, the simple interest rate or the nominal interest rate.  He made the point then that there is the second step which has different rates and has the term \"no later than three years\", which would mean that the transitional arrangement would cease to exist after three years.  However, the issue of \"no later than three years\" raises the question of whether it could go before that.  Deputy O'Callaghan made the point about having to come back to the House to deal with this.  That is why subsection (7) is in the amendment.  It allows for the Minister to make regulations to adjust restrictions to the cost of credit to the consumer under a moneylending agreement, including those specified in subsections (1) and (2), which are the two subsections the Deputy referred to.  We have tried to deal with that there.  That allows the Minister, if he or she so wished, to change subsections (1) and (2) in terms of the rates or in terms of the period that they take effect.<\/p> <p>  The wider issue here is to get the legislation right, and there are ways of doing that.  As I said, I have been here and done that.  I recognise the Government has legislation now that is going to the House for Second Stage debate.  I am not a fool.  For three years when I was pursuing this legislation, that was not happening.  There was a vehicle here which we put to the Government.  The Government could amend this and do whatever is required, not tie us up with two separate sets of pre-legislative scrutiny and two sets of Committee Stage.  This is going to pass.  There is no way to stop this passing Committee Stage today.  That is the problem we are involved in.  I presume the Minister of State is going to vote it all down, but there is no final vote on Committee Stage of the Bill.  We differ significantly on the rates, but both legislative measures have similar proposals in terms of the amendments.  The Minister of State talked about collection charges, which we will come to momentarily.  The issue of collection charges, as the Minister of State recognises, emanated from the consultation that happened in respect of this legislative measure.<\/p> <p>  There is a big fundamental difference between this Bill and what the Government has before the House, and I am sure the Minister of State is well-briefed on the legislation he is taking before the House.  I will give an example of what my legislation would do for a borrower who borrows &euro;1,000 over a 12-year period.  The interest rate would go from &euro;560 down to &euro;360 in the first three years and down to &euro;180.

It amends section 102(1), which currently provides:<\/p> <blockquote> \tA moneylender shall not make or attempt to make an agreement with a borrower who has borrowed or intends to borrow credit from that moneylender for any sum (other than a collection charge), account of costs, charges or expenses incidental to or relating to the negotiations for, or the granting of, the loan. <\/blockquote> <p>Basically, the amendment takes the words &quot;other than a collection charge&quot; out of the original text.  The amendment to abolish a collection charge in moneylending agreements is made in response to concerns and recommendations of stakeholders prior to and during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in November 2020.  For example, in their submission and opening statement during pre-legislative scrutiny, Dr. Olive McCarthy and Dr. Noreen Byrne recommended that any interest rate restriction be coupled with a limit on other fees and charge to avoid circumvention through other or higher fees and charges.  In her opening statement, Dr. McCarthy noted that although the highest rate currently being charged by moneylenders is 187% APR, collection charges can increase the cost of credit to 287% APR.  Similarly, in its opening statement during pre-legislative scrutiny the Social Finance Foundation, which has done a significant amount of work in this area, recommended that imposing a cap on interest rates charged by moneylenders be coupled with the prohibition of fees and charges.  The amendment acts on these recommendations made in November 2020 by prohibiting collection charges under a moneylending agreement.<\/p><p>As a footnote, I recognise the legislation brought forward by the Minister also incorporated the recommendation that arose during the scrutiny of this legislation in that Bill as published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022030900002#F00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1646784000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>The amendment has the effect of adding collection charges to the list of charges that are prohibited under moneylending agreements.
