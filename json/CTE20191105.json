Local authorities are the regulators with responsibility for the drinking water quality of private water supplies, if I may make that distinction.  <\/p> <p>  As the utility supplying public water, Irish Water is responsible for ensuring that public water supplies meet the standards of the drinking water regulations.  Other suppliers including group water schemes and private suppliers are similarly responsible for the drinking water they provide.<\/p> <p>  The EPA's primary focus is to oversee Irish Water's response to drinking water quality failures.  However the agency also requires Irish Water to take actions to prevent drinking water quality failures from happening in the first place and is working to ensure that investment is prioritised for those water supplies that pose the greatest risk to public health.<\/p> <p>  Irish Water must notify the EPA of any drinking water quality failures and the agency then oversees Irish Water&rsquo;s investigation and their actions in response to the failure.  As part of the agency's role in drinking water quality investigations, it may audit drinking water supplies and treatment processes, issue legal directions, take legal prosecutions in certain circumstances, or place a water supply on its remedial action list.  The remedial action list was first prepared by the agency in January 2008 and is a dynamic list of public water supplies that the agency has identified as at risk and as priorities for remedial action by Irish Water.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly address some of the issues affecting the quality of drinking water in Ireland.  In its most recent report on the quality of public drinking water supplied by Irish Water published in September this year, the EPA found that the overall quality of drinking water remains high, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards and 99.6% compliance with chemical parameters in 2018.  While this indicates that the majority of public water supplies are safe, further measures are necessary to improve the security of our supplies and avoid long-term boil water notices into the future.  The 2018 report set out a series of issues affecting the quality of the drinking water supplied by Irish Water that require action, namely, ensuring adequate disinfection of treated water, reducing the presence of trihalomethanes, THMs, in treated water, replacing of lead water mains and household pipes, eradicating persistent pesticide failures above the limit set out in the drinking water regulations, and establishing drinking water safety plans for supplies.  These issues have been recognised for a number of years and the EPA has recommended that Irish Water take a strategic national approach to them to prevent further drinking water quality failures.  The report also highlighted that cryptosporidium detections have increased in the past three years.  It was detected in 25 public water supplies in 2018, up from 17 in 2017 and 12 in 2016.<\/p><p>Cryptosporidium is a parasite found in human or animal waste and, if present in drinking water, can cause persistent diarrhoea.  Illness is often more severe in small children and elderly people and can be very serious in people who are immunocompromised.  If cryptosporidium might be present in a supply, appropriate treatment processes, referred to as a \"barrier\", must be put in place.  These barriers also serve to address certain other parasites, including giardia, which can give rise to similar illnesses, if consumed.<\/p><p> Adequate treatment is required at all water supplies where cryptosporidium has been identified as a risk.  It is not enough to have a barrier in place; it must also be properly operated and maintained.  At the end of 2018, the EPA&rsquo;s remedial action list, RAL, included 15 supplies with inadequate treatment for cryptosporidium.  The EPA will continue to monitor Irish Water&rsquo;s progress towards ensuring that all supplies have an adequate barrier to cryptosporidium.<\/p><p> The issuing of a boil water notice is not a statutory function of the EPA but is done by Irish Water or a private water supplier in consultation and agreement with the HSE.  As the environmental regulator of Irish Water, the EPA emphasises that there is a need for boil water notices and other water restrictions, in certain circumstances, to protect human health.  During 2018, 44 boil water notices were in place in 14 counties, affecting more than 97,000 people.  This is an increase compared to 2017, during which 42 boil notices were in place, affecting more than 21,000 people.  The main reason for the increase in the number of people affected is that 65,000 people were on a boil water notice for three days in early 2018 when a disinfection failure occurred at the Vartry reservoir supply.  More than 13,500 people were also affected by 12 precautionary boil water notices issued due to Storm Emma in March 2018.<\/p><p> It should be noted that a long-term boil water notice is one that is in place on a supply for longer than 30 days.  Of the 44 boil water notices in place during 2018, 26 were short-term notices and were lifted within one month.  Five were long-term notices that were in place for longer than one year.<\/p><p> I want to turn now to the recent boil water notice affecting parts of counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath.  In addressing this, I acknowledge this is an evolving situation and, if the Chairman allows, I will say a few further words on the current issues at the conclusion of my statement.<\/p><p> Irish Water informed the EPA at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October of a mechanical failure at Leixlip water treatment plant, which had occurred on Monday, 21 October.  The EPA participated in a meeting between HSE and Irish Water on the afternoon of Tuesday, 22 October to assess the risk this incident posed to consumers.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council, following consultation and agreement with the HSE, issued a boil water notice.  The boil water notice was a preventative measure and was necessary to ensure that public health was protected and consumers were not at risk from cryptosporidium or giardia, the microscopic parasites that can cause illness.<\/p><p> On Thursday, 24 October, EPA inspectors conducted an audit at Leixlip water treatment plant.  The purpose of the audit was to establish the full facts of the incident and the corrective actions taken.  It was also to verify the performance of Leixlip water treatment plant and to assist in gathering the information to facilitate the lifting of the boil water notice.  EPA inspectors also reviewed the recommendations of the agency's previous audit of 22 March 2019 and assessed the implementation of the actions taken to address those recommendations.<\/p><p>In the audit, the EPA inspectors found the incident began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October, and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October, when remedial works restored the affected production line.  The water treatment plant appears to have operated satisfactorily between 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October and the current issue emerging.  There was sampling of treated water for cryptosporidium and giardia in the critical period before, during and after this incident.  These samples indicated that the quality of water supplied following restoration of the production line was satisfactory.  A blockage in the coagulant dosing line resulted in operational difficulties with the water treatment processes and gave rise to elevated turbidity levels in treated water.  The elevated turbidity levels in treated water indicated a significant risk to the safety of the water supply because the treatment barrier for the removal of cryptosporidium and giardia was compromised and there was a risk of breakthrough of microscopic parasites into the water supply.  There was a failure to respond to multiple alarms that activated in response to the elevated turbidity.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council implemented automatic plant shutdown for the whole plant when turbidity alarms were not responded to within 15 minutes on 24 October 2019, the day of the audit.<\/p><p> While the Leixlip water treatment plant was resorted to a satisfactorily operating status following the incident, the level of treatment at this plant is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water, as further evidenced by the emerging situation.  In particular, there is a deficit for treatment of parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia.  Filter upgrade works are under way to reduce this deficit but will not be sufficient to confirm adequate treatment.  In its October audit report, the EPA recommended that ultraviolet disinfection be considered by Irish Water as an additional treatment barrier to inactivate cryptosporidium and giardia at the Leixlip water treatment plant.  As an ultimate failsafe, ultraviolet disinfection will inactivate any cryptosporidium and giardia parasite in the water supply to ensure the protection of public health.<\/p><p> The boil water notice in question was lifted by Irish Water at 4.30 p.m. following meetings on the afternoon of Friday, 25 October, between the HSE and Irish Water and between the HSE, Irish Water and the EPA.  During an audit of the Leixlip water treatment plant in March 2019, the EPA highlighted the risk of this type of incident occurring, following a mechanical failure of a chemical dosing pump at the plant, and recommended that plant operators respond immediately to any alarm generated, and that if an operator failed to respond to an alarm, that Irish Water should ensure the plant automatically shuts down to prevent inadequately treated water being supplied to consumers.  In May, in response to that audit, Irish Water confirmed the plant would automatically shut down when an operator failed to respond to an alarm.  The EPA audit on 24 October found the automatic plant shutdown arrangement was implemented on one production line at the Leixlip water treatment plant in April 2019 and was only implemented on the remaining two production lines at the plant on the day of the audit.  The EPA's report following the audit on Thursday, 24 October, was published on 30 October on the EPA's website.<\/p><p> As committee members are aware, there is an emerging issue at the water treatment plant in Leixlip and I will take this opportunity to advise the committee on the EPA's engagement on the issue at this point.  Yesterday morning, 4 October, Irish Water advised the EPA there were operational issues at the plant over the weekend.  On Sunday, 3 November, two out of three of the production lines at the Leixlip plant were shut down from 1 p.m. due to high turbidity levels in the raw water entering the plant, attributed to the very high rainfall experienced on Saturday, 2 November.<\/p><p>This shutdown had depleted the reserves of treated water in the reservoirs and distribution network served by Leixlip.  Due to ongoing heavy rainfall yesterday, there continue to be issues with the quality of raw water entering the plant.  The increase in turbidity in the filtered water gives rise to a risk of breakthrough of the parasites cryptosporidium and giardia into the water entering the distribution system.<\/p><p> A meeting was held yesterday afternoon between Irish Water, Fingal County Council, the HSE and the EPA.  Following the meeting, Irish Water, in consultation with the HSE and having assessed the risk to public health, decided that a precautionary boil water notice was needed.  The Leixlip plant returned to water production from all of its production lines yesterday evening to ensure the continuity of the water supply.  Of course, it is vital that the supply be returned to safe production as soon as possible.  The EPA will play its role in verifying that the plant is operating safely, which will include an audit of the plant.  The appropriate time to audit will be when Irish Water and Fingal County Council are satisfied that the plant has returned to satisfactory performance.  The EPA's role will be to verify that performance before the boil water notice can be lifted.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that the agency will continue to provide regulatory oversight.  We are happy to answer whatever questions arise from our statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryan.

I will take him through three or four points.<\/p> <p>  This is a critical public health issue for people in areas served by this water supply.  More important, it is an issue of public confidence in the water supply chain and all those involved therein.  That is why we must deal with it.  I do not want to speculate or comment on press coverage; rather, I will deal with the facts that Dr. Ryan has just put on the record.  I draw his attention to page 2 of his statement, where he referred to auditing drinking waters and treatment processes and the EPA's capacity to issue legal directions and take legal prosecutions.  What directions has it made and what prosecutions has it taken in respect of the Leixlip plant?  He also referred to the EPA's remedial action list.  How is that progressing?  Will he make a copy available to the committee?  It is important that we fully understand it and see who has designated responsibility for the relevant actions.  He might also provide something charting the progress that has been made and the key people responsible for delivering the actions on the list.<\/p> <p>  Page 3 mentions replacing lead water mains and household pipes.  It is not a major issue for discussion today, but by raising it, Dr. Ryan has put it into this meeting's domain.  He might provide us at some future date with a progress report on the EPA's planned works for the changeover from lead water pipes.<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of cryptosporidium and related issues.  I would hate to think there was cryptosporidium in any water supply.  Dr. Ryan discussed the parasites that humans and animals can acquire from water.  Can Dr. Ryan tell us that there is no cryptosporidium in any water supply?  What affected water supplies does the EPA know of?<\/p><p>On the UV system, I am very familiar with it.  I know from work I have done in relation to it how successful it is.  In his opening statement, Dr. Ryan referenced a recommendation that an UV system be put in place.  Did that happen?  What was set in train?  The EPA made the recommendation in regard to the UV system and the likely success of it in killing off cryptosporidium and other parasites, etc.  Was there follow-up in regard to that recommendation?  There is no point in making recommendations if they are not followed up.  I ask Dr. Ryan to update the committee in that regard.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses.  They have been very helpful.

On what legal action we have taken against Irish Water in regard to the Leixlip plant and the current incident, our primary focus is that the plant is back in operation and producing safe drinking water.  This is where all our focus and attention is at the moment.  This is evidenced by us auditing the plant, issuing our report, issuing the recommendations and working with the stakeholders to ensure that the boil water notice could be appropriately lifted.  There has not been a specific legal enforcement measure taken against the plant in regard to the incident.  We would have to give careful consideration to whether that is appropriate or if we have the powers to do that.  As I said, our primary focus is to ensure that the plant is back in operation and producing safe water for consumers.<\/p> <p>  On the remedial action list, we can make it available to the committee.  We track and keep it up-to-date.  It is very much part of our discussions with Irish Water.  It is focused around directing investment in putting in place appropriate infrastructure in priority areas to ensure that drinking water quality is improved.  It is important to mention that our reports in 2018 and previously show that the overall general quality of drinking water is very high, although, unfortunately, we have this very significant issue in front of us at the moment.  We will make the remedial action list and the current situation in that regard available to the committee following this meeting.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of lead.  We mentioned it as one of the priorities that we are tracking with Irish Water.  We will also provide follow-up on that to the committee in due course.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the number of supplies that are currently at risk from cryptosporidium, we will make that list available as well.  Approximately 16 supplies on the remedial action list specifically reference a problem with cryptosporidium.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the installation of a UV system.  We have only just issued that recommendation to Irish Water.  We have given it one month to respond to that recommendation.

To put this in context, we are asking questions today on behalf of not only the 615,000 people who are affected by a second boil water notice in two weeks, which are the most significant ever in this country to my collection, but many thousands of other people.  The witnesses are here to answer the public through our questions.<\/p> <p>  I have read the audit report of 24 October.  Like Senator Boyhan, I would like to touch on the recommendation regarding UV treatment.<\/p><p>According to the EPA audit report, \"the level of treatment at this plant [Leixlip] is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water\".  Dr. Ryan made that point again earlier.  Was the March 2019 audit the first time the EPA made this point, or does it go way back to the 2008 report?  While I acknowledge Dr. Ryan's clear statement that \"the overall quality of drinking water remains high, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards\", these two significant outages have significantly rocked people's confidence in the water supply.  All witnesses must realise how angry, upset and concerned people are about this.  I will deal with more of that when representatives of the Department, Irish Water and Fingal County Council are in attendance.<\/p><p> Dr. Ryan has mentioned a recommendation that was made recently.  As far as I can see, it was made in March of this year.  Was that the first time UV treatment was recommended?  I am particularly concerned about the automatic shutdown now in place in Leixlip.  It is to be welcomed.  An automatic shutdown was recommended in March.  According to Dr. Ryan's opening statement, in May of this year, the EPA received a response from Irish Water to the effect that \"the automatic plant shutdown arrangement was implemented\".  He is now saying that it was partially implemented only.  I ask him to comment on that.  I know it is in place now.  That is important.<\/p><p> As someone who is eminently qualified in this area and is certainly better qualified than me, will he explain what happens with the lag time when an issue is found?  I invite any of his colleagues who wish to come in on this matter to do so.  A couple of weeks ago, there was an outage following an incident that began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October.  It ran for 18 hours, in effect.  The plant was shut down at 10.15 p.m. on the Monday night.  Many people have told me that there is serious concern about contaminants getting into the system in the intervening period.  I know that those involved need to sit down for a meeting.  What happens in these circumstances?  Is Dr. Ryan happy that boil water notices are issued as quickly as possible?  That is the fundamental point.  I am asking about the current outage as well as last month's outage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#K00500","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1572912000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I can confirm that March was the first time we raised the issue of UV disinfection.  It is only in recent years that we have been tracking the deterioration with Irish Water through sampling and measurement.  The number of giardia detections was one in 2015, one in 2016, two in 2017 and one in 2018, but there have been ten such detections so far this year.  There has been a deterioration in the infrastructure treating the plant.  We are now convinced that this is the right way to go.  We mentioned it in March.  We strongly recommended it in our October audit.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the recommendation that the plant should be shut down automatically.  When we came back, we found it was implemented on one of the lines only.  The audit finding was very much that the shutdown should apply to the entire plant.  It is clear that this was misunderstood.  This was remediated when we got back out there in October.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the lag time.  The current situation is evolving.  We are satisfied that we have been notified promptly.  We were involved in discussions yesterday on the implementation of the boil water notice.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the issue that arose in October.  Clearly, there was an operational difficulty that allowed a window of time to happen when remedial action could have been taken.  Alarms were not responded to.  It was not a normal or foreseen event.  The alarm is usually raised when there are operational or mechanical difficulties.  We are usually notified when there is an issue.  It is clear that there was a period of time the plant was operating even though alarms were ringing.<\/p><p>That said, once we are notified, we get involved in conversations with the HSE and Irish Water.  Public health is first and foremost in everybody's mind in that regard and, as such, the boil water notice was issued and precautionary measures, which I am sure will be addressed in detail by Irish Water, were taken, such as flushing out the system before the boil water notice is lifted.  I hope that addresses the Deputy's queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I will come back in at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#M00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I represent the constituency of Louth.  I welcome the comments of the officials and I am conscious of the role of the EPA.  I am tempted to say one does not miss the water until the well runs dry.  I am a former schoolteacher and recall a child being asked to make a sentence using the word \"uisce\" and coming up with \"Uisce in&aacute;r saol: cosanta\" or, in English, \"Water in our environment: protect it\".  That is the premise we must start from.  I was secretary of a group water scheme for 21 years and know the difficulties associated with large and small plants.  Information is critical.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Ryan referred to 99% or 99.6% of water being of perfect drinking quality after treatment, which is good news.  I am more concerned about whether the quality of water in our rivers and lakes is continuing to deteriorate, as I believe it is, and their role in that regard.  It has been suggested that flooding caused the problem in the Leixlip plant.  There has always been flooding.  When the officials from Irish Water appear before the committee, I will deal with a similar situation involving Irish Water in County Louth, where people have been on a boil water notice for 105 days.  Two reports issued by the EPA specifically deal with the Tallanstown group scheme.  I am sorry to widen the discussion, but this issue does not just affect the 600,000 people impacted by the problem in Leixlip.  It is just as important for the 600 people affected elsewhere or the 92,000 who were on boil water notices last year.  As the EPA officials pointed out, that figure increased from 21,000 the previous year.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the quality of drinking water.  Does the EPA have confidence that when it carries out an examination and reports to Irish Water and local authorities, those bodies take action on issues arising?  My experience is that one can tell the bodies what needs to be done, but no action is being taken.  I will deal with that at a later stage.  How effective is the reporting of those bodies to the EPA regarding its recommendations?<\/p> <p>  One may think I am naive but that is not the case.  I refer to two drinking water audit reports in my local authority area.  It is alarming that it took 12 days for a boil water notice to be issued when the water was known to be contaminated.  This issue is as important to the people I represent as the members who are concerned about the issues in Leixlip.   I ask the officials to address that point.  It goes back to the point raised by Senator Boyhan regarding action in terms of legal responsibility and the remedial action list.  I would like the committee to be provided with that information.  More important, I ask that the EPA officials meet representatives of each local authority and Irish Water twice a year to keep people informed.  I was not informed by the EPA or Irish Water that the two reports to which I referred were available.  They were not mentioned to me in my myriad communications on the matter or to any other public representative for County Louth.  I am not blaming the officials for that, but I want to know how effective are their recommendations regarding what action is needed in the interests of protecting public water supplies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#M00300","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The topic of today's discussion includes boil water notices nationwide.

I have eight questions but first I want to put on the record that it is precisely on an occasion like this that the value of the Environmental Protection Agency is proven and I want to commend the witnesses on the audit reports, which are short, concise, clear and easy to understand for those of us who are not specialists.  It gives us a fully independent view of the facts, and that is enormously valuable, both to us on the committee and to the members of the public.<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses take us through what happens after the EPA issued the March-April 2019 report in some detail in terms of its engagement with Irish Water or with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government?  Is there a mechanism for escalating that engagement if there is a feeling, as the months progress, that the recommendations are not being acted on in an appropriate timeframe?  I am particularly keen to know if at any stage the Department is involved in that process if the EPA feels Irish Water is not responding properly.<\/p> <p>  If the eight recommendations outlined in the March-April report had been fully implemented before October, would it be the EPA's view that the October incident and subsequent boil water notice would have been avoided?  That is an important question the public has a right to know the answer to.  There has also been quite a lot of public debate about whether this is an operational issue, a management issue or an investment issue.  I know it does not have to be one of those issues in particular or the other, but I would like to know, particularly with respect to the October event, now that the EPA has done that audit, whether it was primarily an operational issue or as Dr. Ryan seems to indicate in the opening remarks, might there be some investment upgrade issues there as well?<\/p> <p>  On the basis of the information we have about yesterday, there seems to be a different cause to what took place.  Maybe the witnesses could compare, in as simple and non-technical language as possible, the October event and the November event, albeit the EPA has not done an audit yet for what took place yesterday.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of that?  One of the things I am confused about is that this plant has received considerable funding for significant upgrades.  It was upgraded in the 1990s and there was an additional upgrade in 2014 of about &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million so there has been a little bit of a public debate about this being an old plant.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of this?  Is it that there is an older part and a newer part of the plant?  Where are the problems?  Again, I ask them to do so in as clear a manner as possible.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned by a bit in Dr. Ryan's opening statement.  It seems to be a little bit different from the version I have.  On page 6, it says: \"the Leixlip Water Treatment plant is now operating satisfactorily.\"<\/p><p>However, the opening statement then goes on to say there is a deficit for treatment of parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia.  Dr. Ryan went on to say that there are upgrade works under way but when they are completed, if I understood him right, those works will not be sufficient to address the problem.  Can we have more information on that and what would be required in terms of works and their possible cost to ensure the public would have confidence that these kind of issues are not going to be repeated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#N00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1572912000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>There was a series of quite technical questions in there.

We received a response from Irish Water on 3 May which set out the actions it had taken to address each of the recommendations in our March audit report.  As part of that, we are continuously tracking Irish Water's implementation of our audit recommendations via an open investigation file, which an inspector continuously monitors.  In that response, Irish Water committed to completing certain works by specified dates.  We tracked the progress of those works and we have been concerned with slippage identified by Irish Water.  For example, in the response of 3 May to the March audit, the filters were due to be upgraded by quarter 4 of 2019, the end of this year.  That has now slipped to quarter 2 of 2020.  We have continued to monitor and engage with Irish Water to address that slippage and engage continuously to see what the problems are around it.<\/p> <p>  If I could come back to the Deputy's question about how there seems to be a difference between the October event and that of yesterday, he is correct.  October's event was a blockage in a chemical dosing line which meant the water was not being treated correctly for a period.  There was also a period in which alarms were activated and not responded to.  I think the Deputy's question related to whether, if our audit recommendations from March had been put in place, the October event could have been avoided.  Our October audit report clearly called out that if the automatic shut-down had been put in place across the entire plant as was recommended in the March audit report, we believe the incident itself would have been avoided in October.  That action, the automatic shut-down of the plant, is the fail-safe which ensures that whatever happens, if an alarm is not responded to the plant is shut down and cannot produce water that is possibly unsafe or contaminated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Minihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1572912000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>On the bigger question of whether this is a managerial issue, an infrastructural issue or an investment issue, we are still working through that but there are elements of all three, as the Deputy can see clearly in what is emerging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I live in Leixlip and we have always had our water supplied by the Fingal treatment plant.

This is the first time and it has happened twice in a few weeks.  What is different about Leixlip in terms of the Liffey is that while Poulaphouca is supplied closer to the source, Leixlip takes its intake further downstream.  Upstream to that there are sewage treatments plants and pumping stations.  We have become accustomed to keeping an eye on the river and if there is a grey look about it we would be concerned.

They make up what is referred to as the \"old plant\" at Leixlip wastewater treatment plant.  The new plant, which is referred to by Irish Water as the \"AECOM plant\", was completed in 2014.  That is the distinction between the old plant and new plant.  The Deputy asked if it was possible to separate output from the old and new plants.  Separate streams come out, but the treated water is combined into one flow of treated water as it leaves the plant.  One of the questions discussed at the time of the first boil water notices was whether we could definitively tell where water from the PCI plant was going.  Because that water is all blended, with water from the old plant and the new plant leaving Leixlip and feeding the network as a single flow of water, it is not possible to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Minihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Minihan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#P00500","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1572912000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Deputy Murphy asked about pumping stations.  The committee will be aware that a sewer is a pipe of a certain diameter and it can fill up.  If there is no separation between rainwater and the sewage flowing through the pipe, capacity can be exceeded and there can be a combined sewer overflow.  In many cases, this overflow reaches rivers and waterways.  It tends to be more diluted than raw sewage because of water flowing through the pipe.  Part of our March audit examined these issues.  Our audit report included a specific recommendation for Irish Water to draw up a documented protocol for communication between Osberstown and Leixlip wastewater treatment plants so that operators would be alerted if there was an issue.  That is what happened.  My understanding is that the protocol is now in place if overflows occur.

The key recommendation that Irish Water should ensure that there is automatic switchover between the duty and standby polyelectrolyte dosing pumps had not happened.  Another was that operators respond to the alarms.  As we noted earlier, the automatic shut-off in the event of operators failing to respond to alarms was implemented only in the new plant, which was where the March issue arose, and not extended to all the plant.  Our recommendation clearly called out the need for it to be across the plant.  However, as Dr. Ryan indicated, we do not believe that was deliberate but rather was a misinterpretation.<\/p> <p>  The other actions relate to the plant as a whole and have seen slippage.

That sample will need to go to the laboratory and results will be awaited.<\/p> <p>  Following the return to production of the plant, given the raw water turbidity and the fact that there was a lot of rainfall yesterday and on Saturday, there will be a period of time for the filters to return to normal operating conditions.  In our engagement with Irish Water and the HSE, we have stated that we intend to audit that plant.  We would see that the time to audit that plant is when it has returned to normal operating conditions.  We will await confirmation from Irish Water and Fingal County Council as to when that will happen.  Irish Water are better positioned to answer the question about when the sample results will be available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110500002#V01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Minihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Minihan.

I understand these committee hearings are attracting considerable interest on Oireachtas News, which is good because not everybody can come here.  I welcome our visitors to this meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  The purpose of the meeting is to continue our deliberations on Traveller health.  We are meeting representatives of the Cork Traveller Visibility Group, the Health Service Executive and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  We all agree that health and ill health are key issues affecting Travellers who have significantly lower levels of life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality when compared to the general population.<\/p><p>It is not just a small difference.  It is a very big difference, and that is why we are having these sessions.<br\/><br\/>The facts on the level and scale of ill-health among Travellers and the health inequalities experienced by Travellers, as presented to the committee by the submissions and the presentations, are stark in many ways and they speak for themselves.  We know from the very well respected - though in need of updating - All Ireland Traveller Health Study that Traveller men's life expectancy is 66 years of age.  Traveller men's lives are cut short by 15 years compared to the general population, which is a huge and serious gap.  The difference for Traveller women is 12 years.  Traveller mortality is three and a half times higher than for the general population.<br\/><br\/>At our last hearing, we heard that there was a recent health study done in east Limerick that bore out these statistics, and some things stand out.  One was that only 29 people in the local Traveller population were over 50 years of age and only three of those were over 65 years of age.  We have the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, which is still valid but needs to be updated.  We have some local statistics and recent statistics which bear out those trends and those disparities.  Traveller babies are almost four times more likely to die compared to babies in the general population.<br\/><br\/>These growth health inequalities facts and figures were clearly spelled out in general and in very personal terms, because when we have had speakers in here, people have spoken about statistics, trends and social determinants of health, but they have been speaking about their brothers, sisters, fathers, babies and their close family.  Again, we are reminded it is a small population of about 40,000 people, and when we look at the trends on health and mental health, people are talking about their own.  That has come across very strongly in the presentations we have had to date.<br\/><br\/>We heard from Kathleen Sherlock from the Minceir Whidden Society, Maria Joyce from the National Traveller Women's Forum, Nora Mooney from the Kilmallock Traveller group, and of course the veteran health campaigner, Missie Collins.  We also heard from Jim Walsh from the Department of Health who outlined the Government's official response to the health crisis among Travellers.  We heard the strong call for the health action plan to be published and for real and ongoing consultative measures of national and local level to established or even re-established.  That is why the committee is conducting its second hearing on health today.  As members know, we have had three hearings on mental health.  This one is on health in general terms.<br\/><br\/>I welcome everyone.  We are joined by Ms Breda O'Donoghue, the director of advocacy, and Ms Liz McGrath, the health team co-ordinator, Traveller Visibility Group; Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle, head of operations, primary care, HSE, Concepta De Brun, HSE social inclusion unit, Ms Deirdre O'Reilly, co-ordinator of a Traveller health unit; and Dr. Mary Favier, president, and Dr. Tony Cox, medical director, the Irish College of General Practitioners.<br\/><br\/>Before we begin, we have to remind everybody about privilege.  In accordance with procedure, I am required to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings will be given, and that they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity in such a way as that person might be identifiable.  Members are reminded the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of these Houses or an official either by name or in such a way then as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/><br\/>I remind everyone to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they can interfere with the sound and the recording system and affect the television coverage and web streaming.<\/p><p> I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement made to the joint committee will be published on the website after this meeting so it will be on the record.  After the presentations, there will be questions from the members.  I call on Ms O'Donoghue to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#B00200","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1572912000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank members of the joint committee for inviting us here today and giving us this opportunity to speak.  I have been asked to discuss the key issues relating to Traveller health and its impact on our community.  When looking at the key issues impacting Traveller health and the community, we must first look at the root cause of these issues.  Putting another way, we must ask what is killing Travellers today.  There is one answer which is racism.  Over the past 50 plus years, specifically since the 1963 Commission on Itinerancy, Travellers have lived in a hostile environment, where our culture and identity was to be absorbed into the settled community and our very existence repeatedly seen and referenced as a problem.  While we understand that this commission's report is out of print and, as some of us would argue, is obsolete, its legacy has affected the lives of Travellers to this day.  We are seeing the product of a systemic cultural denial and discrimination in our public services from education to social welfare, private enterprises, employment opportunities, accommodation and media.  The effect of this historical assimilation programme on mental and physical health has impacted the Traveller community severely, leading to suicide and mental health being at crisis point, which has been rightly recognised as such by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly.<\/p> <p>  At the Traveller Visibility Group, TVG, our primary healthcare workers meet on a daily basis with Travellers living in Cork.  They see how a mistrust of public services, based on discriminatory attitudes and behaviours of staff, and how policies have deterred Travellers from using these services effectively.  Travellers feel they are constantly struggling and resisting discrimination in their daily lives, where they witness their children struggling in schools and have their own issues with employment opportunities and appropriate accommodation.<\/p> <p>  While the social determinants of health and their effect on the general Traveller community are all important factors, accommodation is widely acknowledged as the key issue causing health inequalities for Travellers.  As reflected in the social determinants of health, if one's living conditions are poor, this directly impacts on one's physical and mental health, education, employment and general well-being.  The vast majority of local authority halting sites are overcrowded, badly-managed, poorly serviced, under-funded and unhygienic.  Put simply, these halting sites are not fit for purpose and lead to illness, injury and stress caused by an overcrowded and high-risk living environment.  We note that in some cases these confined conditions can lead to community disputes around sharing very limited spaces and facilities.  As noted above, poor living conditions lead to poor health.  Cardiovascular, dietary and respiratory problems are common within the Traveller community and can be directly linked to poor living conditions.  <\/p> <p>  Suicide and mental health within the Traveller community is at crisis point.  This can again be linked to the poor living conditions and isolation felt as a result of the poor management of Traveller accommodation.  The situation is clear.  Travellers living conditions and the social determinants of health have worsened since the 1963 commission.  The lives of Travellers are directly impacted by an accommodation and a mental health crisis that directly impacts their physical health and many of these issues are caused by historic assimilation and discrimination.  We need to distance ourselves now from reports and recommendations and start a genuine programme of legislation by creating sanctions to ultimately fix the cultural denial and racism issues that impact so drastically on Travellers lives and their children's future.<\/p> <p>  In general, Travellers tend to use health services as a last resort, often ignoring ailments or health issues until they are at emergency point.  Prevention and early intervention are key to improving and addressing health inequalities and this is directly linked to improving relationships and communication between health services and the Traveller community.  The statistics featured in reports such as the All Ireland Traveller Health Study paint a clear yet stark picture that Travellers are dying younger than the settled community.<\/p><p>They are seven times more likely to commit suicide and 50 times more likely to finish school without a leaving certificate.<\/p><p> While this information may sound alarming today, the sad fact is that it is not shocking news within the Traveller community.  In fact, it is almost identical to the statistics in the last Traveller health study in 1987.  As Travellers, we can see this in front of our eyes every day.  We have a situation where many Travellers are not accessing health services, for various reasons.  However, it has been reported that when Travellers access these services, they often feel the services do not reflect the needs of the Traveller community.  One example is that written correspondence is often delivered to another person on a halting site or maybe not delivered at all.  Whether this is for genuine reasons or otherwise, the fact remains that most Travellers on halting sites miss very important appointments due to lack of postal delivery.<\/p><p> When using health services, Travellers have a fear of the response they will get when presenting with an issue, particularly around children's health, at accident and emergency units.  Many Travellers fear the hospital staff will make assumptions about an injury or illness that has occurred and fear blame for the situation.  There is an increasing fear of hospital staff contacting Tusla or other social welfare services because of assumptions that are made about the way Travellers treat their children.  While we appreciate and welcome the need to be vigilant for children's safety, time and again we see instances of Travellers being treated with distrust and suspicion within the health services, and this creates fear and mistrust among the Traveller community. <\/p><p> To look at health initiatives to support the Traveller community, there is clear evidence that Traveller-led health initiatives, organisations and peer-support workers build trust within the community and, from this, there is a willingness to engage more with public services.  The primary health care programme and the development workers in Traveller organisations play a vital role in assuring Traveller engagement with public services.  There is better uptake of health initiatives and services like screening and health checks when communicated by peers to the community.  When provided with supportive and accessible information, it has been noted that there is a higher uptake and use of such services.  For example, more Traveller women take part in cervical smear tests and breast checks than settled women, which is directly linked to the support of Traveller primary health care workers.<\/p><p> The strong relationship and knowledge sharing within the Traveller organisations is a huge support to the Traveller community on a local and national level.  The support and representation of national Traveller organisations in policy and advocacy work is hugely valuable, and continued investment and support is essential.  Training and capacity building within the Traveller community is vital to promoting health and well-being.  Currently, Travellers are more inclined to engage with health awareness programmes or other training when Traveller organisations are directly involved in delivering the training.  More support of such programmes is necessary and would have productive outcomes.<\/p><p> While we acknowledge that this peer support is vital, we need to see development within the public services to encourage Travellers to be able to use these services directly, with reduced or little support from Traveller organisations.  Traveller cultural awareness training should be funded properly and adapted to ensure that all public service staff, especially customer facing officers, are fully aware of Traveller culture and can engage with their customers in a culturally appropriate manner.  In order for Traveller culture to be understood and appreciated, Traveller cultural awareness training should be mandatory as part of public service staff induction training.  Refresher training for longer-term staff should take place on a regular basis in such services as health, education, social welfare and local authority services, which are the main areas affecting the social requirements of Traveller health and well-being.<\/p><p> It is not good enough for front-line public staff who work directly with Travellers to have no understanding or background knowledge of the Traveller community.  Travellers are part of Irish society and need to be treated as such, with the same understanding and nuance that would be afforded to any individual coming in, looking for assistance from a public service.<\/p><p> I have spoken to the committee today about the key issues affecting Traveller health and the community.  At its root is an historic policy that has been in play for over 50 years.  This needs to change and everybody has a responsibility to drive this change.  There is an institutional prejudice that has been passed down from a group of people who saw us as a problem, not a people.<\/p><p>We have moved a lot in some ways, in that Travellers are recognised as an ethnic group and not something to be absorbed into the general community as the 1963 commission hoped for.  While on paper we are recognised as an ethnic minority, the reality is the deep-rooted feelings of mistrust towards my community have not changed or moved on.  Until they do, then and only then will we start to see a positive change in the health status of the Traveller community.<\/p><p> For the past 20 or 30 years, Travellers have consulted with Government bodies on what can be done for the Traveller community.  We have sat on countless committees and boards to advise and assist.  While we must recognise there has been some positive change in this period, we must also agree the process is slow and, in some areas, ineffective.  The time for recommendations is over.  We need real support and resolute actions where the recommended budgets, guidelines and plans are fully realised and brought into everyday life.  There is no more we can do to assist in the societal change that is necessary to improve the lives of Travellers in Ireland.  We consult but who decides?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Donoghue.

I am the assistant national director with responsibility for primary care services.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Concepta de Brun, the HSE regional social inclusion specialist and Ms Deirdre O'Reilly, the Traveller health co-ordinator for the Cork and Kerry community healthcare area.<\/p> <p>  The All Ireland Traveller Health Study in 2010 provided evidence of a widening gap in health status between the Traveller community and the general population.  It found that people from the Traveller community experience lower levels of life expectancy than the general population and higher levels of morbidity associated with chronic disease conditions and other causes.<\/p> <p>  The goals of the HSE are to promote health and well-being as part of everything we do in order that people will be healthier; to provide fair, equitable and timely access to safe quality health services that people need; and to foster a culture that is honest, compassionate, transparent and accountable.  The HSE is committed to ensuring that health services for people from the Traveller community are provided in accordance with these values and objectives.  The national Traveller health advisory forum, which was established in 2008, supports models of good practice in the delivery of health initiatives to the Traveller community at local, regional and national level.  It operates under the governance of the HSE social inclusion service, which is part of primary care and supports the delivery of actions in Government policies to improve access to health services and address health inequalities within the Traveller community. <\/p> <p> Each year, in the HSE approximately &euro;10 million is allocated through social inclusion services for Traveller health initiatives.  This funding supports staff working in Traveller primary healthcare projects and Traveller health units.  Additional funding is also provided through dormant accounts and mental health services.  The majority of HSE funding for Traveller health is used to support Traveller primary healthcare projects.  There are 27 such projects nationally, which are staffed by members of the Traveller community.  They adopt a peer-led approach, supporting members of the Traveller community to support others in achieving health outcomes.  The projects promote population health initiatives by providing information to families on vaccination and health screening programmes.  This approach has played a key role, as Ms O'Donoghue has pointed out, in improving vaccination rates in the Traveller community.  Traveller primary healthcare projects play an important health promotion role.  For example, they provide education on antenatal care, child development checks, smoking cessation, diabetes care and asthma medication management.  The positive impact of the work of the projects was highlighted in the All Ireland Traveller Health Study.<\/p> <p>  All Traveller primary healthcare projects fall under the remit of eight Traveller health units.<\/p><p>They are located in the nine community healthcare organisations and serve a Traveller population of approximately 36,000.  The Traveller health units are key bodies in delivering appropriate targeted services to members of the Traveller community, overseen by co-ordinators such as Ms O'Reilly.  Every Traveller health unit has an annual action plan relating to the local health needs of the Traveller community in that given area.  These plans contain actions relating to primary care, mental health, public health and health and well-being.  Traveller health units have established regional networks to share learning, ensure consistent practice, and optimise efficiency and value for money.  Arising from these networks, regional initiatives have made a positive impact on the healthcare needs of the Traveller community.<\/p><p> We have provided a great deal of information in our written submissions on the range of actions being undertaken in general by the HSE, specifically in the Cork-Kerry area, in partnership with the Traveller community and other organisations to support Traveller health.  The key aims of the work are to improve access, opportunities, participation rates and outcomes in the healthcare system, to reduce health inequalities experienced by Travellers, to deliver health services in a way that is culturally appropriate, to support positive mental health initiatives and to reduce the rate of suicide and mental health problems.<\/p><p> I thank committee members for their attention and for their interest in the actions being undertaken to improve Traveller health outcomes.  I acknowledge and commend the commitment and motivation of staff working in the Traveller primary healthcare projects, the Traveller health units, primary care services and the wider health service.  Through them, we are committed to providing fair and equitable access to health services and to supporting improvements in health outcomes for the Traveller community.<\/p><p> Ms De Brun, Ms O'Reilly and I are free to take members' questions, if they have any.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McArdle.

The ICGP is tasked with providing education and training to the general practitioners, GPs, of the country.  We are a membership organisation that sets quality and standards.  Approximately 85% of GPs are members of the ICGP.<\/p> <p>  As has been well elaborated on at this meeting, a recent study has found that the Traveller community is affected by several significant social determinants.  As the ICGP, we want to concentrate on those that most impact on general health.  The life expectancy statistics show stark inequalities in health among the Traveller population compared to the general population.  Studies in maternal health, communicable diseases, addiction and mental health, including suicide, serve as clear indicators of the extent of this health inequity.<\/p> <p>  The high levels of mortality and morbidity among Travellers are well documented.  The life expectancy figures are most stark.  A male Traveller can expect to die 15 years sooner than a male in the general population, with a female Traveller 11.5 years earlier than her counterpart in the general population.  The infant mortality rate is 3.6 times higher for Traveller children than in the general population.  While there have been improvements among Traveller mothers attending antenatal services and having shared antenatal care between maternity hospitals and GPs, more than 2% of Traveller mothers still receive no antenatal care.<\/p> <p>  It is encouraging to know that many Travellers engage with primary healthcare services in particular, as evidenced by the 2010 All Ireland Traveller Health Study.  The study found that up to 91% of Travellers obtained their health information from GPs.  Travellers' own health beliefs may impact on access to health services, however.  For example, GPs treat appointments as the start of a process in treating their patients whereas Travellers may view the consultation as a single issue that should be dealt with in one visit.  These are matters of which we need to be aware.  In some cases, if symptoms do not improve, it can lead to a visit to a hospital emergency department rather than a return to the GP.<\/p> <p>  Health initiatives for the Traveller community must be informed by the principles of equality, human rights, social inclusion and respect for Traveller values, beliefs, culture and perceptions.  As with the general population, Travellers should have improved access to, participation rates in and outcomes from healthcare services.<\/p> <p>  The very high prevalence of suicide among Travellers is of particular concern.  Measures that would help include on-site sessional counselling and general practice, culturally appropriate awareness campaigns and outreach services signposted to primary care.<\/p><p>Targeted health initiatives and associated information materials for Travellers and healthcare providers should be culturally appropriate.  Any identified interventions should be designed to improve self-esteem among Travellers, reduce stigma and remove barriers to care.  Regardless of the health policy initiatives instigated for Travellers, the views of Travellers must be included when designing such interventions.  Traveller participation and co-operation in previous studies, research and information design have been key to their success.<\/p><p> While Travellers experience issues with access to GPs, the same is true for large sections of the population.  Clearly, access to GP services needs to be improved and some basic improvements could make large differences.  Practices that offer a combination of booked appointments and some same-day appointments would improve Travellers' access to GP services.  Cultural awareness training is appropriate for all practice staff and should be developed with input from the Traveller community.<\/p><p> The process of obtaining and retaining a medical card needs to be streamlined and simplified.  The health outcome differences between Travellers and the general population are avoidable and with appropriate resourcing and planning, these issues can, and should be, addressed urgently.  The Irish College of General Practitioners looks forward to playing a significant role in this area.<\/p><p> We are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Favier for her opening statement.

My first set of questions are directed to the HSE.  It was mentioned that one of the key aims of the HSE is to deliver health services in a way that is culturally appropriate.  How is this implemented?  What training do HSE staff receive and who delivers that training?  Is the &euro;10 million annual funding to Traveller health initiatives sufficient given the health needs of the community?  Was an increase in funding sought under budget 2020 or in any of the last five budgets?  If so, what was the response from the Department of Health?  Ms McArdle described a Traveller health provision structure which is siloed from the rest of general service provision within the health service.  What are the documented experiences of Travellers accessing general health services or in other words, services that are not Traveller-specific?  Is there a long-term shift planned to mainstream Traveller healthcare within general services, perhaps as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms?<\/p> <p>  My next set of questions is to the ICGP.  We heard previously in our sessions on Traveller mental health that many Traveller patients have had their medical cards revoked.  If there is documented impact in this regard, what has been the impact thus far on Traveller patients?  I made the suggestion at a previous committee hearing that regardless of a Traveller's circumstances, until such time as we exit the current health crisis every Traveller should be given access to a medical card.  I would like to know if the witnesses agree with me in that regard.  Are the HSE and the ICGP doing enough in the face of the Traveller health crisis?  Is there prejudice when it comes to healthcare services and what is being done to root it out?<\/p> <p> My final questions are to the representatives of the Traveller Visibility Group, Ms Breda O'Donoghue and Ms Liz McGrath.  Ms O'Donoghue mentioned that the main cause of poor health outcomes is substandard living conditions.  What type of engagement has the group had with local authorities in regard to raising the standards on that ground and has there been real dialogue between Traveller organisations and local authorities on how the issue can be addressed?  It was also mentioned that the uptake in cervical screening is higher among Traveller women than in the general population and that this is due to the Traveller-led nature of the health intervention.  Ms O'Donoghue also mentioned that the group is constantly consulted to give advice but that while there is consultation, when it shifts to Traveller-led services, it changes.<\/p><p>How can this model be developed for further inclusion and development within the HSE in respect of other forms of Traveller healthcare?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#H00300","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I will call the representatives of the HSE in the order in which questions were asked of them.

There are two or three parts to our approach in this regard.  The Traveller primary care health projects are co-designed with Travellers as part of an approach to health services, or health service pathways, that is led by Travellers.  This is not a health service in itself; it is a location where Travellers can help other people within the community to access health services in their areas.  My colleague, Ms de Brun, will give further details on that in a moment.  The other role of the Traveller health units is to produce culturally appropriate materials that are co-designed with the Traveller community, are tailored to meet people's needs and have messages that are suited to the Traveller population.  This is not about setting up a separate health service; it is about ensuring the services we provide through the health services are as accessible as possible to the Traveller community.  The different Traveller health units take a prioritised approach.  They may prioritise particular actions, for example relating to chronic diseases or screening programmes, in different areas.  The HSE materials are designed to be appropriate to and supportive of the Traveller community.

If one has a strong Traveller health unit, more of one's staff will be trained.  Our new health plan includes a commitment to improve our cultural awareness training.  We rely heavily on the peer support workers in the Traveller primary healthcare projects to provide culturally appropriate training.  All staff who attend and sit with Traveller health units have participated in cultural awareness training.  In addition, we culture-proof and literacy-proof anything we co-design or deliver alongside our cultural awareness training.  We do not develop any materials without working in partnership with the Traveller community.  All small local projects that are achieving or are doing very well are brought to the regional network and the learning is disseminated among the peer support workers in that network.  Models of good practice then come to the national Traveller health advisory forums.  One of the projects we are working on at the moment is the national mental health promotion training programme, which is a \"train the trainer\" programme.  Twenty trainers have been trained as part of the pilot and we are ready to try to roll it out.  The project was co-designed by members of the Traveller community and mental health staff.  I will set out where we are falling down with our work.  We probably need a much more robust framework to ensure culturally appropriate training is given to people beyond primary care and not just in the primary care and social inclusion services where the Travellers are located.

I work in counties Cork and Kerry and have the privilege of working with some of the other delegates who are present.  Silos can occur and people can be left out or marginalised further.  If we wish to address the marginalisation of the community, we must take two approaches, namely, a targeted approach and a mainstream approach.  Those types of approaches run the risk of becoming worse or siloed unless there is genuine commitment to Traveller leadership, Traveller voice and community development through an empowering model.  Those of us in the HSE must listen when we are told that we are getting it wrong or that the Traveller community has an approach which it knows works within its community.  It is always very important to explore such options.  One can look at the issue through equality frameworks and analyse whether the targeted work we are doing is genuine or indirectly creating worse situations.  The latter is something we never want to happen.  It is a very good question.  In counties Cork and Kerry, we try to work from a community development approach.  We do not view the social determinants of health as aspects of health that are outside the control of the HSE but, rather, try to work closely and, it is to be hoped, respectfully with Traveller organisations in the area to see what we can do to address the health inequalities caused by discrimination, lack of education or poor accommodation.  We explore whether there is something we can do to influence these factors or ensure the voices of various groups are heard.  People have differing understandings of these matters.  It is a very good question.

However, it is not just about having a medical card; it is about accessing services and turning up for healthcare, preventative services and acute services.<\/p><p>In that same report, it is detailed that 83% access care with their GP even though 98% have the medical card, only 57% attend hospitals and less than 5% attend the mental health services.  Therefore, it is not just about having access to the medical card, but we would agree that all members of the Traveller community should have medical cards.  We have heard the shocking statistics about the mortality, life expectancy and suicide rates.  It is just shocking.  To think that group of patients in society would not have medical cards would be appalling and we would support all members of the Traveller community automatically having medical cards.  Those who do not have medical cards would not be turned away or refused access to services.  We all work in an out-of-hours service and we work in our practices and nobody is turned away because they do not have the means of paying for the service.

In respect of architects and people who design accommodation, has an analysis been conducted on whether there should be training for them as well?

We have always included a needs assessment for the area in those submissions.  One of those recommendations has been transient sites, which work very well in other countries.  I refer to Traveller needs.  Some Travellers are quite happy to be in a standard house, some are happy to be in a halting site while others are happy in a group housing scheme.  Approximately 95% of Travellers in Cork are in local authority housing or rented accommodation but that is not by choice.  We have argued for years in our submissions that the preferred choice of accommodation of Travellers is halting sites, transient sites or Traveller-specific group housing schemes.  Unfortunately, our submissions went to the wind at the best of times.  However, I have been delivering Traveller culture awareness training to student architects in University College Cork for the past five or six years, particularly addressing Traveller-specific accommodation.

There is great potential for cultural awareness training on many issues, not just those concerning Travellers.  It would be appropriate in many different fora.  However, the best evidence would have to be applied.  That evidence shows that this training should always be provided using resources delivered by those who are affected, in this case Traveller groups themselves.  In any other niche type of education, the evidence always indicates that this is how the education is best provided, whether in the context of an undergraduate setting, GP training or in postgraduate education in which the ICGP is involved.<\/p> <p>  I also refer to the issue of accommodation and resources.  I have been involved in Traveller health for the best part of 20 years as a GP.  I can attest that accommodation issues have been front and centre in the past five to eight years.  It has so much to do with housing, but it is also about austerity in a wider context.  Resourcing issues are manifest in a lack of GPs, with new GPs leaving and not enough being trained.  As a result there is a shortage of appointments.  Vulnerable patients, who are more likely to need walk-in services or may default from an appointment and need to be offered another one in a timely fashion, can no longer be accommodated.  Patients wait a week to get an appointment with me.  There is very little flexibility because of a shortage of GPs and a shortage of training.  Other austerity measures, for example, concerning medical cards have disproportionately affected Travellers.  The validation of medical card lists is done in a broad sweep.  A cardholder can receive paperwork with which to check his or her medical card even though it was renewed and a new plastic card issued only three months previously.

It also contributes to the infant mortality rate and to later presentations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Travellers in such accommodation live in fuel poverty and spend disproportionate amounts trying to heat inappropriate accommodation, which has a knock-on effect on presentations to general practice.  Unless we address these systemic and ingrained problems, everything will have a knock-on effect and this always means the most vulnerable in society, of which Travellers are part, are disproportionately affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier"},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>My question is for the ICGP.

It means the most vulnerable people are left at the end of the queue.  My own partner had to wait a week and a half for an appointment in the primary healthcare unit in our area.  This affects certain people in the Traveller community even more.  Not only do letters go to different addresses but postmen sometimes do not go into a halting site.  What do Dr. Favier and Dr. Cox think is needed?  I have tabled questions on GP training and the numbers going through the colleges.  We can talk about services for the Traveller and Roma communities but we need to know what it will all cost.  Will this committee or this Parliament insist that the necessary money be given to provide these services?  Funding for services for the Traveller community has not increased for the past ten years.  We are hoping for crumbs off the table in the shape of the Dormant Accounts Fund to do work the witnesses do in the area of social inclusion.<\/p> <p>  This committee needs to identify the issues and address them with funding.  The all-Ireland Traveller health study found that 90.3% of children were reported as having problems, with asthma the most common condition.  What needs to be put in place to deal with that and how much will it cost?  Can the services be integrated into other services?  The HSE submission and questions from Pavee Point referred to jobs in primary healthcare projects.  Members of the Traveller community work between six and 12 hours a week and do not have pensions.  We will have to examine how many nurses will be needed to play the critical role between the community and the primary care units, and how much will be needed to fund them.  It could mean that more than &euro;10 million will be needed.  It is not good enough to have studies, programmes and assessments without getting down to the nitty-gritty and match the needs with money.

We would not be able to deliver the services without them.  The peer support model works.  However, as it has developed and grown since 1994, it has been stuck in a social protection, poverty culture.  I do not say that lightly.  A person would be reluctant to take up a full-time job if it would affect their medical card eligibility.  Recent increases in the minimum wage resulted in some workers not having their medical cards renewed because they were over the income threshold.  The option for them, therefore, was to reduce their hours and, thus, their income, to retain their medical card or to leave.  The infrastructure on which all the successful work has been done proves that it works but it needs investment in planning for the delivery of existing and future services.<\/p> <p>  Another element to the start of this investment has been our work in partnership with Pavee Point and Maynooth University to deliver pre-capacity training through 100 hours of education.  I understand the interviews for members of the Traveller community to participate in that course in the university are taking place today.  We are hopeful 15 members of the Traveller community will achieve a FETAC level 5 to level 6 standard in their first year and that this time next year, they will start a FETAC level 8 qualification course.  The HSE has committed to finding the people who complete that course meaningful grade 4 minimum salary posts.  We ask the committee to examine other Departments and statutory bodies following suit on this as a broader range of posts need to be made available.  While we started this process with Maynooth University in providing training in youth and community work through a five-year plan, a big picture approach needs to be taken under the public sector duty heading to ensure Travellers are employed across all Departments and statutory agencies.  <\/p> <p>  It is important all Departments participate in intercultural health and training.

GPs are getting a little older and it is becoming increasingly more challenging to encourage younger GPs to stay in general practice or to work in general practice full-time.  They do not seem to like the idea of working in isolated, single-handed practices.  Only 2% of them in a recent survey said that this is what they wanted to do.<\/p><p>They like to have a blended career where they work in hospitals and universities as well as in general practice.

Some like to go to support workers of their own sex when seeking advice and so on.  Are there many more women than men acting as Traveller-led support workers?  I suspect so.  Is it working better with women?  Do we need to ensure more men are engaged as support workers to get men to engage?  I do not know the answers; I am taking the questions out of the sky.  Obviously, we want to get all Travellers to engage with the health services.  Is there a disparity between the number of women engaging and the number of men engaging through Traveller-led services?  Is there a disparity between the number of women leading the services and the number of men leading them?  We need to examine this.  The delegates might tell me whether this is an issue.<\/p> <p>  I always believe in taking something positive from any meeting.  Many very interesting issues can be raised, and many good suggestions have been made.  I wish to focus on an issue that keeps coming up, namely, the bureaucracy encountered in gaining access to a medical card.  The medical card office is the most unforgiving in the country for anybody dealing with it.  It is utterly unforgiving.  If one does not answer a letter within a 28-day deadline, one must start all over again on the 29th day.  People lose heart as a consequence.  Those who are most remote from the system lose heart fastest.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in getting a little more feedback on the number of Travellers who are issued with letters but who do not act on them because they have moved on or who throw them aside because they are removed from the system.  Many people, including settled people, throw them aside also. The more removed a person is from the system, the more likely it is that the letter will be thrown aside as a bother and will be forgotten about.  In such circumstances, a person will go to the general practitioner only to be told the card has expired.  How significant is this issue?<\/p> <p>  I will go through all my questions.  The second issue I wish to raise concerns the statistics we have been given.  They indicate that 13% of Travellers finish secondary school and that 57% of male Travellers only get a primary education.  Ordinary literacy skills, such as reading and writing, are an issue.  We all come across this.  The older the cohort, the greater the issue.  It matters when trying to fill out a complicated medical card form and such documentation.  Is there information and evidence indicating people simply give up?<\/p> <p>  I do not believe this has just to do with ordinary literacy skills.  We often ignore what I call bureaucratic literacy skills.  This involves a higher level of skill.  I know a Department that made a very clever move in this regard.  Where a form was developed on one side of the Department, clerical officers or executive officers on the other side were asked whether they could fill it out without knowing what it was about.  If, with their bureaucratic literacy skills, they could not fill it out, it was no good giving it to a member of the ordinary public, or even a member of the public with third level education.<\/p><p>I wonder to what extent there is a problem with the two levels of literary skill.   I refer, in particular, to what I call the bureaucratic literary skill, that is, for form filling and so on.  I have been contacted by all sorts of people who find filling forms to be increasingly challenging.  To what extent is accessing documents a problem?  The volume of documentation required nowadays for the simplest tasks is frightening.  I spent a fair bit of time yesterday with somebody who wanted a supplementary grant for a house.  The person is a Traveller who was trying to provide information.  It seems that the system is more concerned with catching one person who might get something he or she should not get than the 1,000 people who might have got that to which they were perfectly entitled but just could not get the paperwork together.  Society seems to have become rigid in that regard.<\/p><p> I do not know how many people have studied the medical guidelines, although they may have done if they deal with medical cards.  There are two ways in which one can obtain a medical card, the first of which is according to strict financial guidelines.  I heard a case yesterday of a 65 year old who happens not to own their own house.  A Traveller could own a caravan, however, and would have no rent.  The guidelines, even for those over the age of 65 years, specify maximum weekly earnings of &euro;298.  Even on jobseeker's allowance, the basic rate is higher than that.  I am sure our guests will tell me that without means, one can obtain the card on a concession, but the guideline figures are very low.  The normal ways they help people are with mortgages; rent, although if one has a caravan, that does not count; and childcare, although in some cases the parents take care of the children and do not pay for commercial childcare.  The only other way of obtaining a medical card is in the form of a discretionary one, but the applicant will have to be good with a pen to know what is an eligible expense for a discretionary card.  I am highlighting the barriers.<\/p><p> When we take it all together, to what extent is the medical card challenge an issue?  One receives a nice little plastic card with a date on it.  If a credit card has a date, I know that it will be good until then.  In the case of a medical card, however, it might specify an expiry date of 2021 but halfway through 2019, I might be told I will be called for a random check.  How much of a help would it be if the cards were issued for five years and the expiry date was the expiry date, unless one could be proven to have defrauded on a massive scale one's entitlement to a medical card?  As the man says, the medical card is not worth all that much.<\/p><p> The issue of Traveller self-identification was raised.  The concept is nice but I can see the layers of bureaucracy that will apply.  There are two problems with self-identification, on which I would like our guests' views.  People do not necessarily want to self-identify.  Some do but others do not.  Some are proud but others are not.  Some feel cowed because of what life has taught them.  The other point is I can imagine the HSE adding another five pages to the forms to tie one up in that regard.<\/p><p> If our guests consider some of the issues I have raised to be valid, would it be worth our while asking the medical card section to appear before the committee and take a grilling on the issues?  That is my punchline.  Are our guests facing such issues and if so, should we present those issues to representatives of the medical card section?  I am sure our guests could raise other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#R00900","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The Deputy is reading all our minds.

It is an issue of which we must be aware.  Those barriers can range from sitting in the waiting room through to, for example, presenting to younger female doctors.  Those are cultural issues and it is for us, as GPs, to be aware of those issues, attempt to circumvent them and understand cultural issues around not wishing to present with mental health issues, for instance.  <\/p><p> We have recently rolled out a suicide prevention training programme that has involved almost 500 GPs and a particular part of that relates to the increased risk of suicide in the Traveller community and the issues for men presenting with mental health problems.<\/p><p> The access to services and educational opportunities for women in the Traveller community have come on extraordinarily in the past 20 years.  There has been a massive change and Traveller men are only starting to catch up from a health point of view, which is to be welcomed.<\/p><p> Bureaucracy issues fall disproportionately on the women because they often have to deal with trying to sort out all the medical cards and keep on the top of the paperwork and appointments.  As GPs, we would value clarification on the medical card issues because patients can present with a valid, brand new plastic card that is not valid.  Practices such as ours are long established and we know the patients well so there are many workarounds but in out-of-hours and GP on-call services, that is a fundamental problem.  Situations arise where there are tensions around patients presenting without cards, who has a card and who does not, and whether a card is valid.  It needs to be sorted out.<\/p><p> The bureaucracy issues apply on so many levels in respect of literacy.  There is a need for cultural awareness that form filling should not be done just for the sake of it.  The centralisation of services to what we call the offices off the M50 has proved problematic for patients and is challenging for GPs.  We meet significant literacy skill issues in the area of health bureaucracy.

After that, what that means for the population, trends and data will tell us, but I suppose the specific focus at the moment is that members of the Traveller community, children, adults and older people, know the services are available to them and that they are enabled and facilitated to access those services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#Y00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle"},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#Y01000","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1572912000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>On the issue of prejudice, it is well established that Travellers experience prejudice and racism in our society.

We know their histories and we know their context and, therefore it is less likely to be an issue, but I cannot say that it does not happen.  We need to accept reality and focus on ways that we can potentially change it.  In terms of ways we can change it, the committee spoke about the health action plan.

Our first challenge is to make sure they do not get worse.  There has been such a structural undermining of some of the systemic supports, whether it is in the number of primary care workers in the Traveller area, whether it is the medical card issue or whether it is the accommodation crisis.  There are statistically more Travellers who are homeless.  The number is huge.  They all impact in the broadest sense on health outcomes.  That is the most important one.  I imagine it could be 25 years.  Again, I do not have a crystal ball, but it will be incremental, and there has to be an integrated approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier"},{"type":"speech","time":1572912000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019110500002#Z00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1572912000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>To answer the first question, yes there is prejudice within practically all services as far as I am concerned.
