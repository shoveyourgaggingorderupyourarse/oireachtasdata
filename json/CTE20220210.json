I begin by welcoming witnesses and members to the meeting.  While Covid-19 restrictions are receding, and while it is open to members and witnesses to attend meetings in person, I ask that they continue to use face coverings.  When addressing the committee, face coverings can be removed.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  This morning, we engage with the officials from National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to examine the national broadband plan, NBP, expenditure and related matters in the context of the 2020 appropriation accounts, Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications.  The meeting will be suspended for an hour at 12.30 p.m.  When we resume at 1.30 p.m., we will engage with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, to examine the national broadband plan expenditure and related matters further.<\/p> <p>  NBI has been advised that the committee may wish to examine the following matters related to expenditure on the national broadband plan during the course of the engagement: the impact of the pandemic on delivery; NBI's financial structures; the current progress and timelines; subcontracting arrangements; lease and rental of infrastructure from other companies; and penalty clauses in the contract.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from NBI: Mr. Peter Hendrick, CEO, Mr. T.J. Malone, chief executive officer of deployment, Ms Tara Collins, chief marketing officer, Mr. Barry Kelly, chief financial officer and Ms Jenny Fisher, chief legal officer.  They are all very welcome.  When we begin to engage, I will ask those who are attending remotely to mute themselves when not contributing, so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those who are in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or are switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation for anything they say in the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witness' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or of a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The CEO, Mr. Hendrick, is very welcome.  As is detailed in the letter of invitation, he has five minutes.  I know he has a longer statement, which has been circulated to members.  I ask that he keep within that timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021000002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644485400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I will.  I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation to discuss the national broadband plan today.  I am the CEO of National Broadband Ireland.  I am joined by Mr. T.J. Malone, who is CEO of NBI Deployment and who leads the team that is building the NBI network.  In addition, we have senior management teams: Ms Tara Collins, who is responsible for marketing communications; Mr. Barry Kelly from finance; and Ms Jenny Fisher on governance and who is the interface with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The team and I know from our work with other Oireachtas committees that it can be challenging to convey the size, scale, and complexity of the NBP from a boardroom setting.  Therefore, we have instigated a programme of field trips to show first-hand how the NBI network is being deployed.  The sessions have been widely recognised as informative and helpful.  For this reason, there remains an open invitation to all committee members to experience the work of our teams out in the field.<\/p> <p>  As CEO of NBI, I remain incredibly proud of the work our team is delivering, particularly against the backdrop of turbulent conditions caused by Covid-19.  NBI has been operating for 25 months, 23 of which have been under the shadow of the pandemic.  I believe that, despite the extreme and turbulent conditions faced throughout the project to date, the work of our team provides a platform that gives us confidence to deliver the project on time and on budget.  Our team has now scaled, with construction active across all 26 counties and more than 1,200 people hired, onboarded and working on the project.  That includes our specialist subcontractors, the likes of Integro, Indigo, KN Group, Secto, Actavo and TLI.  We are also working with infrastructure operators such as Open Eir and Enet.  I acknowledge all of the hard work that has been done by everybody involved to date, as well as the collective commitment to bring high-speed broadband to those who need it most.<\/p> <p>  Across the project, we have already made major achievements.  More than 298,000 premises have been surveyed, of which in excess of 252,000 have been designed or are in detail design.  These activities are vital precursors to the main build and they are continuing at pace.  More than 54,500 premises are currently able to place their order via their preferred retail service provider.  There are in excess of 154,000 premises that have been constructed or are under construction.  For context, the original plan would have seen us at approximately 180,000 premises under construction at this stage in the programme.  We have now awarded contracts to our build partners for more than 195,000 premises, which includes network build due for completion in first half of 2023.  A total of 475 broadband connection points, including schools, have been installed by NBI.  We have also increased our minimum speed from 150 Mbps to in excess of 500 Mbps, as well as offering 1 Gb and now 2 Gb products.  We recently announced that we are delivering high-speed broadband infrastructure to six islands off the coast of Donegal and Mayo, two of which were completed in January.  More than 50 retail service providers have already signed up to sell services on the NBI network, ensuring an increased range of products, all being offered at competitive prices for consumers.<\/p> <p>  As I have just mentioned, in excess of 154,000 premises either have been constructed or are under construction.  We believe this metric is the leading indicator for delivering the programme.  For context, the equivalent figure this time last year was approximately 19,000.  Therefore, it can be seen how this is ramping up and how it will directly feed into premises passed and connection numbers in time.  Additionally, we are implementing a series of initiatives that lend confidence to the delivery of the 2022 programme and beyond, including, but not limited to, the fact we have contracted with Eir to increase the volume of pole replacement and duct insulation, which commenced on 1 October 2021.<\/p> <p>  Turning to other matters, I can appreciate some recent media attention on the shareholder structure of NBI may have concerned members of the committee.  We endeavoured to clarify these matters in a transparent and open way at an Oireachtas joint committee two weeks ago.  We welcome the opportunity to attend today to provide further clarifications.  Consequently, I would like to clarify the following points.  The ownership structure remains as it was at the signing of the contract.  The shareholders of NBI Infrastructure DAC and NBI Deployment DAC are Metallah Limited and the Minister, who holds a special share with certain consent rights in respect of NBI Infrastructure DAC and NBI Deployment DAC.  The shareholder of Metallah Limited is Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited.  Above Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited, there are holding companies and investment vehicles into which the various investors have invested at different levels.  This structure would not be unusual in the context of a major infrastructure project with a series of international investors.  David McCourt, via voting rights in each tier of the company's structure, retains control of NBI.<\/p> <p>  On the potential for bringing in new investors to the project, I would clarify the following.  As the risk profile of the project evolves, it is likely that some of our early stage investors, who helped to turn NBI from an idea into reality at a point when there was still much unquantifiable risk in the project, will be replaced with investors who specialise in long-term investments.  This has always been the plan and is the reason that mechanisms for change of ownership are allowed in the contract, subject to approval from the Department, as is standard practice in such long-term contracts.<\/p><p> The corporate structure as it is today or into the future will not change NBI&rsquo;s contractual commitments or collective goal, delivering the infrastructure that will radically transform the country&rsquo;s broadband landscape.  Any new investors will be required to step into the proportional share of the shareholders' funding commitments.  The shift to new investors, who will bring this long-term capital, will not cost the people of Ireland or the State any additional money and will not impact on the day-to-day operations of the business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hendrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644485400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I must stop Mr. Hendrick there.

We looked at this aspect of alternative technologies in 2018 and 2019.  We explored where the market for low-orbit satellite technology was going and that for 5G.  Considering the future-proofing of fibre technology, it was intended originally that we would have launched with 150 Mbps.  The benchmark in urban areas became 500 Mbps.  In this context, it is important to remember that the purpose of the NBP is to provide equality in broadband access across the country between urban and rural areas.  In urban areas, 500 Mbps is now the minimum benchmark product.  We moved our product to that standard.  The network we have built and are building supports speeds of up to 10 Gbps being delivered to homes, without replacing any equipment.  We can undertake a software upgrade to bring that speed up to 25 Gbps, which will involve replacing a small box in homes and that can be posted out.  The fibre technology itself, the capacity we are building into the fibre network and the way we are designing and engineering that network will support many hundreds of Gbps of capacity way into the future.

We talk about surveys happening on the ground in respect of testing poles and testing duct to ensure it is clear to install cable.  We were significantly behind in doing surveys, but we have now recovered in that area.  We have put more surveyors into the field and we are ahead now.  It is the same with designs, where we had a challenge in getting designers onto the programme.  We have now put more designers into the programme and we are now ahead there as well.  Equally, we are ahead with the connections.  We have more contractors trying to get more homes connected.<\/p> <p>  The building programme is, of course, the most significant part of the challenge.  We have more than 1,000 people actually building the network.  Concerning the issue of the impact of Covid-19 and close contacts, we have teams of between four and six people.  Therefore, if one person contracts Covid-19, that has a significant impact on the programme.  What we are doing to recover in that regard is that we are increasing the number of make-ready activities happening.  Eir has increased its volumes since October.  The intent is that it will double the capacity in respect of the number of poles it will replace annually.  Eir will also increase the amount of underground duct it is going to install from 1,500 km to 2,500 km annually.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the background, we had originally planned to deliver this project with two contractors.  We now have four contractors on the ground, and we are also looking to bring additional contractors on board to increase our activity and the volume of completions annually.  To give some context concerning where we stand today, in the first two months of this year we will be installing enough cable every month to get from here to Paris.  Those figures will increase as the number of contractors working on the project and the number of builds increase.

Infrastructure has not been built in some of these locations in more than 20 years.  Therefore, as we are building out the network, we are learning ways to do things more efficiently.

In the case of Ballyhooly, there is a housing estate that quite literally is being split down the middle in this regard.  While we accept that the market is providing and that there is an entity called NBI, as public representatives who spend a lot of our time advocating on issues such as access to broadband, particularly in the current climate of remote working, we find it hard to understand why there is not a greater degree of interoperability or connectivity between NBI and the private operators to solve problems and ensure provision of services to people in villages.

If somebody has 30 Mbps or between 30 Mbps and 100 Mbps, he or she is obviously on a commercial operator's network, whether Eir, SIRO or another provider.  I would expect - we are seeing this in terms of the announcements that are being made by commercial operators - that there will be a transition to future-proof networks, those being fibre.

I refer again to Ballyhooly, because as far as I am concerned it is a ground zero for every village of a similar type.  There was an expectation that there would be a realisation of the commercial realities, but also a realisation of the corporate social responsibility of ensuring that where there were gaps, right down to micro-level, NBI would be the responsible partner in ensuring that where public representatives like me make representations through our broadband officers in the local authorities or directly to NBI, there would be an understanding of that dynamic and there would be moves to fast-track or, at least, recognise the fact that there are households wherein there are two parents working remotely and a post-primary or third level student who are quite literally taking turns using the broadband such is the lack of capability.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hendrick speaks about an offering by NBI of minimum speeds of 100 Mbps, a 1G product and a new 2G product.

The early-stage investors obviously were never in it for the long term.  Were they just named partners?  The build-out is not a particularly lengthy contract.  Have investors dropped out?

To the extent that those assumptions are wrong, the contingency pot is eaten into.  However, to the extent there are savings against that, they get clawed back 100% by the Minister.  There are assumptions in respect of rates paid to Eir.  ComReg obviously sets the rates for Eir.  To the extent they change, the pot is eaten into up to the cap.  If it goes above that, NBI swallows the excess.  However, to the extent there are savings &mdash; ComReg has recently spoken about the potential to reduce some of the costs &mdash; 100% goes back to the Minister.  The third pot relates to connections.  As we connect up to 550,000-odd premises over the next 25 years, some will be in more easy to access areas and some will be in more difficult to access areas.  The average costs will vary from premises to premises.  Where there are more expensive connections, we can draw from the pot up to a certain cap.

Notwithstanding that we have that obligation, and we are building the network to meet that contractual obligation and the demand for the future, we are engaging.  We have a request for proposal, RFP, in the market at present, for which we have already received the first round of responses for a number of wholesale operators, where we could leverage their network and service.

That work is essential because it will have benefits in terms of people returning to the islands and repopulating them and in sustaining communities.  That is very welcome.  However, there are also black spots in urban areas.  Colleagues from across the House will know of black spots in towns, villages and cities in the areas they represent.  There are several in my own area.  I am not seeing the sense of urgency Mr. Hendrick has spoken about with regard to connections in those area.  How are those issues going to be resolved?  It seems that dealing with issues in urban areas would be simpler given that the services are practically outside people's doors.  These providers, Eir, Enet and others, give commitments to connect these premises but it never happens.  We are talking about years, long before 2020.  People are losing faith.  Ultimately, that is the engine of the economy.  We need to ensure that there is good connectivity across cities and counties.

We will engage with them over the coming months and will look at practical solutions, including the use of alternative networks, products and services to connect those homes.

We are seeing that the demand for high-speed broadband is greater, that the capacity requirements are greater and that Eir is committed to switching off the copper network, notwithstanding other retailers in the market that have TV or mobile services that are driving their customers onto this network.  The achievement of 85% should happen significantly faster.  If I go by Eir&rsquo;s switch off of copper, Eir has committed that it wants to switch off that copper network within five years of NBI finishing in a deployment area.

Delays in the planned roll-out continued in 2021.  This was reflected in the annual target set for the cumulative number of premises able to avail of the broadband service.  As indicated in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2021, the target set initially was that 102,000 premises would be able to avail of service by December 2021.

The national broadband plan is a transformational national project that is unparalleled and is unique in terms of its ambition, scale and complexity.  It will deliver high-speed and affordable broadband initially to 550,000 homes, schools and business premises in Ireland.  Over the 25 years of the contract, it is expected to serve over 600,000 premises.  In line with the Government commitment, this will ensure that 100% of premises in rural Ireland, including those in the hardest to reach places, will have a broadband service that is in line with the rest of country.  This will be done as part of a single programme over seven years, and it will be delivered within the budget of &euro;2.6 billion.<\/p> <p>  2020 was the first year of the NBP contract. It saw a significant level of mobilisation activity by National Broadband Ireland, including the recruitment of personnel, procurement of materials and contractors, installation of equipment and exchanges and building IT systems to support the network.  Surveys and designs were progressed to inform the build programme, resulting in the first homes being connected to the new fibre network in January 2021 in County Cork.  Over the course of 2021, the project continued to build momentum.  By the end of last month, almost 296,000 premises were surveyed, build works were under way in almost 120,000 premises and a further 34,500 premises were passed.  Some 54,500 premises could order or preorder a service, while 469 broadband connection points, BCPs, including 200 primary schools, have been connected by NBI to date, with many of the public BCPs now supporting remote working.<\/p> <p>  Well over 1,000 people, all of them in Irish companies, are employed in the project.  There have been delays to the roll-out programme compared to the targets set in the contract.  Like many other construction projects, the NBP has been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The specific challenges for the project due to Covid and the mitigations put in place by NBI are set out in the briefing note that has been provided to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Reuse of the existing rural network, comprising about 1.5 million poles and 10,000 km of duct to lay the NBP fibre network is a condition of state aid and makes sense from a value-for-money and sustainability perspective.  While it was anticipated that elements of the rural network would need to be mediated or upgraded, the extent of the remediation required, particularly the underground network, is greater than was envisaged when the contract was signed.  Both Eir and NBI are addressing these issues, including the introduction by Eir at the end of last year of rapid response teams to support the timely remediation of network issues as they are identified.  Eir has also increased the volume of poles and ducts to be provided under the make-ready programme, which is a positive development.<\/p> <p>  Given the reliance on the Eir network, ongoing close collaboration between NBI and Eir is essential to the successful delivery of the project.  Additional resources have been brought into NBI and its subcontractors.  Local authority licensing issues have been substantially revolved, following intensive engagement between the Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, working with NBI.  The contract makes provision for dealing with delays to delivery of the network and provides for circumstances where subsidy will be permanently withheld where milestones have not been met.  Where there are unprecedented events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI can seek what is termed \"relief\" under the contract and additional time to meet contract milestones without facing deductions to their subsidy payments due from the Department.<\/p><p>In circumstances where such relief is permitted, no sanctions would apply.  In other circumstances, the contract provides that sanctioned provisions relating to delays in the delivery of the network are applicable with respect to any delays that occur from the end of contract year 2, which is from 1 February this year.  Sanctions will be applied as appropriate and will be calculated and imposed in line with the contract.  This places a significant pressure and incentive on NBI to speed up the delivery of milestones missed.  Due to delays in rolling out the network, NBI as a commercial company is also losing out on critical revenues from customers it should have connected by now.<\/p><p> Regarding the ownership and financial structures of NBI, the ownership structure of NBI remains the device in the contract awarded by the Department.  The Minister has rights of consent under the contract in respect of changes in ownership or control and NBI must notify the Minister in advance of any such event arising.  There have been no notifications of changes to ownership or control to date.<\/p><p> The social, economic and environmental benefits of the national broadband plan cannot be overstated.  As each home, school and business is connected, the benefits of the plan will be experienced in the daily lives of people across the country.  Without the national broadband plan, the market would not deliver broadband to all citizens in all parts of the country.  My Department is fully seized of the transformational nature and benefits of the national broadband plan and we are fully committed to driving the project forward.  We are also fully seized of the scale of the investment the Government is making in this project and the necessity of ensuring value for money throughout.  Robust governance for a project of this nature, scale and cost is paramount.  There is a skilled and resourced multidisciplinary team in the Department implementing the protections and provisions drafting into the contract.  The national broadband plan is supplemented by external legal, financial and technical advisers on network build and service metrics, project costs, procurement of materials and subcontractors.  Corporate governance requirements are being overseen by the Department.  My Department is engaging with NBI to finalise its roll-out plan for 2022.  This plan will be completed by the end of March and relevant details can be provided to the committee at that stage.  I look forward to assisting committee members in any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021000002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644485400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Griffin and his colleagues for coming in.  It is good to see them again.  There are a few things I would like to cover.  We had a good discussion this morning with NBI and Deputies were able to ask questions about delivery.  We now know there is a small number of connections relative to the number of passings, which is less than it might have been.  We have heard about that.  How is the Department going to hedge bets on the delivery challenge?  There is a delivery challenge at the moment, some of which is understandably down to Covid-19.  Mr. Griffin said that in his statement but the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, went further in the D&aacute;il and acknowledged that some of the delay, in his view, is because of NBI.  NBI discussed that this morning as well with regard to difficulties bedding in and so on.

I did not hear the session with NBI this morning but I understand that it covered that to a significant extent as well.  The Covid-19 impacts were very significant.  One of the challenges was that when the engineers went out to do the build on the ground they were seeing things that could not have been anticipated at the time that the contract was being put together, such as in the condition of the underground network.  That has led to the challenges in addressing the deficiencies as identified, engaging with Eir to have them remedied and ensuring proper governance arrangements for all that work to be pulled together.  As I said, good progress has been made with Eir in additional poles and duct being rehabilitated under the programme.  That is a positive.  It is important that both parties remain engaged to make sure that any wrinkles in the \"make ready\" programme are identified, escalated and addressed and that there is an appropriate governance and oversight mechanism in place to make sure that is as smooth as possible.  When building on an existing network with somewhere in the region of 99 km to 146 km of fibre cable, depending on whether you are talking about premises passed or premises connected, and 10,000 km to 15,000 km of duct to be reused, you will come across those difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021000002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1644485400,"counter":630,"content":"<p>It would be fair to say there is quite a lot of fibre in urban areas already-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021000002#AA00400","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644485400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>There is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021000002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1644485400,"counter":632,"content":"<p>-----so there is quite a lot of opportunity provided by that.

If I understood Mr. Griffin correctly, he is talking about 25 consultants assigned to the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  I submitted a parliamentary question for written answer on 19 January of this year asking how much the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was spending on external consultancy services.  The figure I got back was &euro;14.3 million, of which &euro;10.1 million, approximately, was being spent on external services for this very project.<\/p> <p>  If I break that down further - and the reply is a matter of public record - Analysys Mason received &euro;3.9 million, EY business advisory services received &euro;5.3 million and William Fry legal advisory services received &euro;846,000.  That adds up to approximately &euro;10.1 million.  Is it possible to give a further breakdown of the spend between the three entities I have just mentioned?<\/p> <p>  The reason I ask the question is that I perceive that in latter years Government Departments have been hollowed out and there is an increased dependency on external advice.  None of us are against the idea of external advice.  It needs to be procured if and when a certain skill set or a specific project needs to be delivered.  That is understood.  However, &euro;10.1 million seems to me to be an extraordinary figure.<\/p> <p>  What were EY's business advisory services, for example?  The consultancy, the PQ reply states, is for financial and commercial advisory services, but it amounts to &euro;5.3 million, which is not an insignificant amount of money.  Is it possible to provide the committee with a further breakdown of that cost in terms of, to use the vernacular phrase, billable hours?  What is the Department getting for &euro;5.3 million?  What is it getting from Analysys Mason for &euro;3.9 million and what is it getting from William Fry for &euro;846,000 so far?  That is only for 2021.

To follow on from the conversation with Deputy Dillon, we have been tasked with overseeing the successful delivery of a once-in-a-lifetime project that is hugely complex and that will cost the State a maximum subsidy of &euro;2.6 billion and then a bit for VAT.  It would be utterly irresponsible of me if I did not ensure we had the expertise of the brilliant people I have working with us in the Department and external consultants.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned Analysys Mason.  I will get Mr. Nearly and Mr. Mulligan to come in on this because they deal with the teams every day.  Analysys Mason has been with us for a while.  We went to tender and it came back to us.  It provides services in development of the contract, technical solutions, evaluation, support in respect of the State aid, reference officer evaluation, project cost, model, compliance and robustness evaluation, mapping and monitoring of the intervention area, input to State aid issues and a whole range of work being done now, because we are in the active build and deployment phase, on supporting the overseeing of that.<\/p> <p>  I hope, with the passage of time, that more of that work will come back into the Department because Mr. Mulligan has lots of experience in the telecoms sector, as does Mr. Neary.  Ms Leeson is our governance expert and Ms Carrigan is a chartered accountant.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in is project sponsor.

It is a difficult determination to make because Covid impacts on everything, from top to bottom of a project, and wreaked havoc in the early parts of last year and this year.

A household being &ldquo;passed&rdquo; is what allows it to order a broadband service.  We do not yet have a number for that from NBI in respect of the end of the year.  We are still scrutinising that because our job is to challenge whether that is the best the operator can do.  We want it to go faster and do more, and my engineers are scrutinising whether that is a credible number and whether we can get the operator to go faster.

There are milestones for all the deployment areas in Louth and Cavan.  Every deployment area has a milestone attached to it.  That is why this year, there could be 15 or 20 milestones we are checking along the way to see whether the operator will achieve them.  There are 227 deployment areas.

Today, we are being given potential figures of between 100,000 and 130,000, which seems like a huge variation that has not been fully explained.  My sense of it, which I think is shared by the people who are waiting anxiously to have broadband provision passing their properties, is that NBI appears to be quite confident that any recalculation of targets or milestones will be explainable and, in so far as it is explainable, NBI is satisfied the penalties will not apply.

If we sign up both parties to an updated interim remedial plan for 2022 and if those figures are not achieved rolling forward, then penalties will apply against the targets.  From my perspective, there is a level of assurance when we look at the number of premises surveyed, the designs done and the premises at construction.  There is a degree of momentum now that gives us a greater level of assurance.  However, we will look at things very closely and do our own assessment on whatever figure NBI provides to us.

The point I am making, just to be crystal clear, is that many houses, taking in tens of thousands of residences in Ireland, will not get any direct broadband connection until 2026.

It was quite a prudent move.  It is clearly a much larger country with a much denser population so there would not be the same overhead costs in doing that.  There have been other countries looking at the same process.  I am not being critical but I just want to bring the matter to the fore because it is important.  It is not something we often hear about but there are many people out there who are completely cut off.

One of the questions we have tried to tease out several times relates to the reason for going with this model when the contribution from the private investor is so small, at just over 9% of the contribution by the taxpayer, which accounts for in excess of 90%.  Why would the Department go with this?  We have learned that the investors are getting 12% compound interest, which, of course, can accumulate significantly, doubling in nearly six years, for example.  The only answer we have been given on the few occasions the matter has been raised is this issue of risk.  In the context of risk, I understand there are supposed to milestones and all that and there are three tiers of those.  This is a project underpinned by the State.  The State has ponied up the money.  It is there.  From the point of view of an investor, investing in this and getting 12% annual return compound interest on an investment underwritten by the State is a sure bet.  If you were a gambler looking at this, it has to be the best investment in town.  People try to play the stock market but this has to be one of the surest bets around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021000002#KK02000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644485400,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I will go back to first principles in terms of the types of models at which we looked.  We did look at a large number of models.  The Chairman is familiar with this from his time on the committee concerned with telecoms.  We looked at full State ownership, a joint venture, the concession type and the gap-funded model.  All of that was done pre-2016.  A Government decision was taken in 2016 that this was the best model that was available.  There were reasons for that, such as the significant reuse of existing private sector infrastructure.  The commercial sector will share the construction and demand risk, and there is significant such risk in the early stages of this project.  The commercial sector will drive economies of scale.  If a strong contract is put in place, which we have done, that will give the State the necessary protections and the State can claw back unused subsidy and share in any excess profits.  That was agreed by the Government in 2016.  We did a project reappraisal in 2018 when we were down to a single bidder.   All the documentation relating to that is in the public domain.  There is &euro;175 million that has been put in by the investors.  That money is at risk.  It does command a rate of return.  That would be expected in respect of any investment in a project of this nature.  We looked at the rates of return that were under consideration when the contract was being finalised.  We did benchmarks internationally, using KPMG, our contact in this regard, and the internal rate of return, IRR, and the interest rate referred to by the Chairman were absolutely typical for projects of this nature where there is significant demand-side risk and an uncertain market.  The Chairman referred to the level of uptake so far.  We are comfortable enough that we are heading in the right direction but there is significant demand uncertainty.

We are the people who run constituency offices.  We understand full well the significance of the NBP.  We also understand the deficit which exists in respect of the provision of the broadband service.  I think that is self-evident, and I do not think we need to be reminded of it.  I am, however, concerned about the standard of replies that my office receives when contact is made via the dedicated email address for representations to NBI.  I would like to see a greater degree of transparency regarding the number of representations made through that email channel and how many of those representations from the offices of Deputies and Senators are actually resolved.  I refer to a broadband connection ultimately being made.<\/p> <p>  Whether we like it or not, and whatever about the commercial considerations and the costs, the fact remains that an expectation was created that a service would be rolled out.  The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased or fast-tracked that expectation.  I think we would all agree on that point.  Therefore, a demand and an expectation exist for these services, which I think is a legitimate one.  I refer to people in particular circumstances of which we are all aware, whether down dale or up glen, where there is an expectation of being able to work remotely.  Sometimes there is a perception that people in rural Ireland have particular types of jobs and fulfil particular types of functions.<\/p><p>I want to remind everyone that the people in rural Ireland are the people with PhDs, MBAs, masters, and they are working remotely across pharma and academia, and that needs to be understood.  They need the access; that is the bottom line.  They are professional people living in these communities and they have a legitimate expectation.  If there is one thing arising from today it is that the quality of engagement with Oireachtas Members should improve such that we can expect legitimately that, when we make representations on behalf of these very people whom I am talking about and there is some sort of priority give to that.  Very often we are the door of last resort for these people because they have tried every other option, given they are more than capable of engaging with the commercial providers themselves and they have done so, but they are coming to us because they have no other place to go.  They have a legitimate expectation of us that we would interface with representatives at <i>nbi.ie <\/i>and they would then expect, and we would expect, that we would receive some sort of a return, and a deliverable.  The deliverable in this case is a connection ultimately. <br\/><br\/>That is why I was concerned by the amber map from day one. I do not profess to be an expert in; I am a layman in all of this, not a financial wizard.  I have no technical knowledge in respect of networks or telephony, but I do know what the needs of my constituents are.  I do not see how, in this day and age, there is not some blend of service that could be provided that is a solution for each household.  I do not think there is anything that is insurmountable by way of a solution for every household given the paradigm shift that has taken place.  That is where people like are coming from, quite simply.  We need to get information back to this committee in respect of how many representations have been received by Oireachtas Members and how many of those have been resolved whereby a connection is made.  We need some qualitative and quantitative analysis of those representations in terms of whether they are succeeding through our interventions.<br\/><br\/>My second point relates to the BCPs.

In the interests of inclusion and accessibility, I will give a visual description of myself.  I am a white woman with short blond hair.  I am wearing glasses, a red jumper and a white shirt today and I am sitting in front of a green virtual background.  I am the co-ordinator of towards work, a person-focused initiative that works to support any person with a disability on his or her journey towards employment, self-employment and further education.  We are part of the Open Doors initiative, a not-for-profit that supports marginalised members of our society by working to create equitable opportunities in employment and education.<\/p> <p>  The Open Doors initiative is a collective of more than 100 organisations, companies and NGOs that work with Government Departments to create pathways to education and employment for marginalised people.  Since Open Doors began in 2019, we have helped in excess of 16,800 people with a 600% increase in 2020 despite Covid.  We work alongside employers and educators to ensure we are creating inclusive employment opportunities and equitable education environments.  People we help onto pathways to work and education are there on merit.  They have the skills and capabilities to do the work and actively take part in academic life.  They are, however, experiencing barriers that their non-disabled peers are not facing.  The UNCRPD makes it clear that there is a right to an inclusive education system at all levels.<\/p><p>The need for change that will hugely impact people with disabilities in education and employment is highlighted regularly and often.  In Ireland, one in seven people is living with a disability.  Some 70% of people with a disability aged between 20 and 64 acquired their disability after the age of 16.  It is likely that many of us will acquire a disability at some point in our working lives.  Disability is a part of life.  However, the barriers facing the disabled community should not be.  We must stop placing the onus of resolution on the shoulders of those with a disability and start considering how our structures, systems and procedures are disabling our young people, colleagues and peers.<\/p><p> Of people with a disability who are aged between 15 and 50, 13.7% had not progressed any higher than primary level education.  This is in comparison with 4.2% of the general population.  People with a disability are less likely to complete third-level education, with 37% educated to this level compared with 53.4% of the general population aged between 15 and 50.<\/p><p> Research shows that people with disabilities have far fewer employment opportunities when compared to their non-disabled peers.  In Ireland, a person is half as likely to be in employment if he or she has a disability in comparison to a non-disabled peer.  This need for change is why the Open Doors initiative and its projects, Towards Work and Employers for Change, exist.  We are here to create pathways to education and employment for marginalised people, while educating and empowering educators and employers.  Open Doors launched the Towards Work project last September.  It was launched by the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, and is supported by the Dormant Accounts Fund and Pobal. <\/p><p> Since our launch, we have engaged with more than 300 participants at different stages of their journey toward employment and further education.  This has been in the context of online training sessions and providing individual support as well as our bespoke mentorship programme.  The mentorship programme offers individuals a unique opportunity to meet with a mentor who has the skill set to support them on their journey towards further education and employment.  As part of this, the participant has the opportunity to set his or her goals and seek advice and support from a trained mentor whether that be for work or education.<\/p><p> We were delighted to be able to support Technological University, TU, Dublin deliver a bespoke module on self-employment for people with a disability.  This was the first of its kind and was led by Professor Thomas Cooney.  A total of 20 students took part in this course and were brought through the process of developing their business plan.  Each student was matched with a mentor from the local enterprise office, LEO.  From this course, we anticipate that six students will go on to start their own business.  Self-employment is rarely explored as an option for those with a disability.<\/p><p> We have seen how a lack of access to education creates barriers for people with disabilities.  This module on self-employment facilitated by TU Dublin created an opportunity for people to access further education and explore the area of entrepreneurship.  This is an example of how removing barriers to further education can open up and create pathways for people with disabilities.  When we discuss employment in the disabled community, we rarely view the employer as being the party with a disability.  Education is a vital tool in changing this.<\/p><p> Further education should open doors for all; it should not create more barriers.  Our experience and feedback from participants has shown that a lack of access to information on supports and grants can create barriers.  When we take a one-size-fits-all approach to our supports, we inadvertently exclude many.  More thought also needs to be put into the accessibility of education environments, including transport, remote study offerings, access to clubs and societies, lecture theatres, libraries and other venues.  Where we lack accessibility, we cannot promote real inclusion.<\/p><p> Finally, we must acknowledge and consider the intersectionality between marginalised groups.  We have one example of a young migrant we helped who has a disability and who was experiencing homelessness.  We assisted this person with education and welfare grants through a huge effort.  The rules and regulations created by a well-meaning system can sometimes mean that these students slip through the cracks and do not continue in further education or are no longer supported on their journey.<\/p><p> A fear of losing welfare supports and income holds many potential students back.  In this instance, we have seen individuals lose welfare supports due to choosing full-time education.  Being forced to choose between welfare support and further education places puts individuals at risk of poverty.  The Open Doors initiative is focused on supporting these individuals through our projects such as Towards Work, which acts as a resource that can signpost those who need it to the necessary supports and grants to help continue their education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":969,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hayes very much for her opening remarks.

I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to have an input to this committee meeting.  I work in the area of vocational rehabilitation with a particular focus on the workplace and employee retention.  I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the connection between our present-day students, their education and the workforce of the future.<\/p> <p>  Since the arrival of Covid-19, all of us, as a global community, have a deeper appreciation for easy and unlimited access to products and services in the pursuit of living our lives in whatever manner we would like to.  We have learned the value of easy access by living through the various restrictions of the past two years.  Yet for many people with disabilities, restrictions in how they live their lives is part of their daily lives.  As we near the two-year anniversary of Covid restrictions, discussions such as today's are timely.  The purpose of the UNCRPD is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  The Irish education system, through legislation such the Education Act 1998, Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act 2004, promotes both access and participation in education by confirming the constitutional right of children to education.  Second-level students are currently preparing for mock examinations and filling in their CAO forms.  They are trying to figure out what they will do after school and what life will hold for them.  How will the education system serve them to ensure a future where everybody is equitably included in life and can progress through all levels of education and into the workforce?  There may be more questions here than answers but I believe that part of what today is about is to reflect on how the provision of education in Ireland aligns with the UNCRPD in creating an inclusive society.<\/p> <p>  Article 24 of the convention requires the provision of an inclusive education system at all levels so people can reach their full potential and participate effectively in a free society.  It further specifies ways in which people with disabilities are to be included by ensuring effective individualised support measures and reasonable accommodations are provided in environments that maximise academic and social development consistent with the goal of full inclusion.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on this goal of social development.  It is not just the person with the disability who needs the social development but his or her peers as well.  I grew up with a very limited understanding of disability as there were no children with disabilities in my school.  Never having had any connection to a person with a disability, people with disabilities were invisible to me for many years and so it is for countless others until they are confronted with a health condition, injury or alteration to life as they know it and everything changes.<\/p> <p>  Returning to work after an illness or injury can be challenging but it is not impossible if workplaces are open to talking through options.  Unfortunately, many have limited experience of disability management in the workplace and are unsure where to start.  As a result, the absence is unnecessarily prolonged and, in some cases, results in exit from the workforce.<\/p> <p>  Let us imagine the transformation to the workforce of the future if all present-day children grew up with a better understanding of disability and learned in classrooms surrounded by children of all capabilities, where differences are not seen in negative terms but are supported through a variety of teaching methods, embracing all learning styles, and where teachers who themselves have disabilities teach and where Braille or sign language resources are readily available, as referenced in Article 24.  That is what inclusive education looks like.  Students graduate and emerge into the working world with an understanding of disability and a positive experience of inclusion; they have begun to cultivate a more inclusive mindset from a young age.  Students with disabilities will have a richer learning experience and be able to compete on a more equal platform for jobs in the open labour market.<\/p> <p>  I believe our students of today need to learn about principles of universal design regardless of their field of study.  They need to learn to ask questions about how people interact with the built environment, products and services.  They need to ask how these interactions change as we go through life and perhaps acquire disabilities or health conditions as we age.  They need to ask themselves how the work environment can support this transition and know that the answer is by designing systems of work and jobs that are universally accessible to all, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialised design.  Today's students are our future leaders, product and system engineers, recruitment managers and architects who will design our future cities, grow organisations and create a society that is inclusive and open to exploring options that serve everybody.<\/p><p>I am sure many of the members here today will have heard said it is society that disables people, creates barriers of accessibility and excludes people.  Our students of today need to listen to the voice of people with disabilities so that they can create, with intent, an inclusive future world.  To do that, they need to graduate from a system that everybody has been part of.<\/p><p> In preparing for today, I asked some primary school teachers their experience of disability in their classrooms.  In addition to their desire to have more special needs assistants, SNAs, their responses included the need for more training in how to better support disability.  Some were clear on the need for specific training on supporting children with autism and were in agreement that more training of this nature should be mandatory.<\/p><p> I trust my contribution today has bridged a gap in making the connection of our present-day students being captains of industry for tomorrow coming from an inclusive system that has supported all needs equitably.  I thank the members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":972,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Finn for her contribution.

I thank the committee for this opportunity to speak to the members today to highlight the barriers people with an intellectual disability and autism continue to face when seeking employment.<\/p> <p>  Cope Foundation is a Cork-based charity supporting 2,800 people who have intellectual disabilities and autism.  Latest figures from the ESRI, published in 2021, show that over 71% of people with disabilities and of working age in Ireland are unemployed.  We need to address this.<\/p> <p>  I am making this submission today on behalf of people we support in the Ability@Work programme.  Ability@Work promotes inclusive employment and works closely with employers to provide sustainable supported employment opportunities.  We link employers with people who are distant from the labour market.  We receive our referrals from school-leavers and from adult day services where people have completed their second level education in specialist schools affiliated to Cope Foundation services.  This programme was funded for three years through the national ability programme and now through interim funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund and Pobal until December 2022.  We are one of 45 funded programmes around the country but, unfortunately, what we have at present is a sporadic and scattered service across the country with a particular lack of supports for people living in rural areas.<\/p> <p>  Ability@Work is a successful model of best practice creating inclusive workplaces.  We have supported 100 people who were unemployed.  Over the past three and a half years, we have placed 73 people in paid jobs and are upskilling a further 70 people in preparation for work.  This model is easily adaptable and transferable across all marginalised groups.<\/p> <p>  Future funding for this programme will be key.  It will be essential to give the people we support the security to know their service will be available for them in the long term.  We need to be able to employ highly skilled job coaches and offer them job security.  We also need to be able to offer a sustainable service to employers.  We must budget for post-school training and work supports.  We are over-reliant on funding that does not offer longevity or security to the people we support.  For true inclusion to happen in the workplace, the disability sector needs long-term committed support and resources from Government to enable specialist services, such as ourselves, to support and maintain in jobs the people we know whose needs cannot be met by Intreo or the EmployAbility service.<\/p> <p>  We need to change the culture of low expectation for people with additional or more complex impairments.  We can do this through early interventions in mainstream and specialist schools, incorporating career guidance, valuable work placements and engaging with local employers.  We must work to change employer attitudes so that it becomes the norm to have a person with different ability in the workplace.  This cultural shift needs to happen through campaigns with families, employers, HR professionals, trade unions and support networks.  We must encourage employers to see the business case.  We need to address disability awareness and encourage companies to be inclusive throughout all aspects of their businesses.  Employers need to be fully informed of all the supports they can avail of and the services available to them.  Post Covid-19, in our experience, very little has changed for the people we support.  They are excluded from general recruitment practices due to lack of experience and qualifications.  Often employers will only recruit for full-time roles and will not allow flexibility or accommodations.  The online screening and application systems make it impossible for some of the people with intellectual disabilities to compete for a role.  The design of job descriptions and essential requirements must be changed to ensure we are including everybody during the recruitment process.<\/p> <p>  As we plan to go forward over the next decade, innovations in technology will have a significant impact on people's ability to keep pace with all the technological advances.  It may leave many people behind.  However, these advancements in technology can also open up more opportunities and independence for people with higher support needs.  They may also enable people with more severe impairments and mobility issues to transition to employment.  For example, the Getting A Life programme in the UK, which finished in March 2021, was set up to enable people with severe intellectual disabilities achieve paid employment and have full lives when they leave education.  In Ireland, many are leaving mainstream school or have finished training courses and are finding themselves at home with their parents and without supports.  Often they do not know where to go or even the supports to which they are entitled.  For many, there are no supports in their locality.<\/p> <p>  Projects like Ability@Work are good value for money, having more positive outcomes for people and their families.  Sometimes getting a job is only one part of the solution.  Being part of a workforce and being treated as an equal has much more significance.<\/p> <p>  It cannot be understated that the transition out of Covid-19 is a further barrier.  Some people do not feel comfortable going out in large crowds.  Some have lost their social skills and ability to return with confidence to the workplace.  Some have lost their jobs.<\/p> <p>  As stated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, everybody has the right to employment and to earn freely a living of their choosing.  I will hand over to my co-presenter today, Mr. Craig Kelly, who is a participant on the Ability@Work Programme, who will talk to the committee about his lived experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":974,"content":"<p>I am the president of the very first Ability Board.  I have an intellectual disability, but that is not who I am.  The Ability Board is an advocacy group that fights for the rights of people with intellectual disabilities in education and employment.<\/p> <p>  I want to share with the committee something very personal.  I finally have the courage to speak openly about this.  It is just one of many stories of when I was discriminated against just because of who I am.<\/p> <p>  When I first started in Ability@Work, in 2018, I started job searching.  When I finally got an interview, I was very excited.  I and my job coach prepared for this interview for days and I felt confident before I went into the interview.  The interview was going great until I mentioned the fact I had a job coach.  They asked me what a job coach was.  I told them they help people with disabilities find employment and I knew straight away they did not want me to work there or even hire me to give me a chance.  I knew when their faces fell and I could tell by their body language.  I was really upset because of this.  I felt like a fool.  I said to my job coach that I did not even know whether I even had the confidence or heart to go to another interview because of getting denied and thinking no one would ever want me.  Ability@Work helped me through this because I thought to myself I would be no good anywhere else.  I am still very nervous of interviews, especially if there is more than one person there.  That experience still really affects me to this day.<\/p> <p>  It took a lot of work to pick me back up from the anxiety I was feeling about my future.  I just thought I was useless and I would never be anything.  After a while, my job coach encouraged me to get involved in advocacy.  That is how I became president of the Ability Board.  The election campaign really changed my life for the better.  It was such an exciting time.  It made me feel so powerful and important.  The day of the election was one I will never forget.  I have learnt now that having a disability is nothing to be ashamed of.  The more we talk about it, the more it will be accepted.  I have an invisible disability and I always found it hard when it came to the end of an application and the company asks you to tick a box if you have any disability.  I never knew what the right thing to do was.  Would they never accept me if I ticked \"Yes\"?  Would they even hire me to give me a chance?  Now I always just tick \"Yes\".  I do not want to work for a company that would not even interview someone with a disability, but it took a long time for me to get to this stage.<\/p><p> The Ability Board wants to talk to people in charge of Irish companies who can really make change in a workplace.  We believe we can change the recruitment to make it more inclusive by becoming part of interview panels in Irish companies.  We also want to give companies disability awareness training with the help of Ability@Work staff.  There is no point in giving disability awareness training if you have never had to deal with the barriers we face every day.  We are the ones who should be training people.  The Ability Board wants to bring Easy to Read to businesses, public places and tourism.  Easy to Read documents are made up of short, very simple sentences that just have the most important messages on them.  Easy to Read uses pictures to help people understand better.  We can make decisions if we can understand what is going on.  Easy to Read needs to become something that everyone in the country understands.  We want to make this a reality.  As president of the Ability Board I want to be the voice for other people with different abilities in Ireland.  It is my duty to do this.  I want to change how people look at the word \"disability\", and teach people about how you can be part of the change.  I want to make sure we are treated as equals and not like children.  Even as adults we are often treated like children.  People make decisions for us all the time.  The Ability Board wants to change this.  We are the real definition of \"nothing about us without us\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Craig Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":976,"content":"<p>On behalf of Down Syndrome Ireland, and in particular the Kildare branch, we thank the Joint Committee on Disability Matters for inviting us to speak here today.  My name is Rita Walsh, chairperson of the branch and I am joined by Gr&aacute;inne Gorey, our secretary and Dr. Fidelma Brady, head of education with Down Syndrome Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Kildare branch was founded 1985 by a group of courageous and forward-thinking parents.  We now support 235 members and their families across Kildare and west Wicklow.  We are a voluntary organisation under the umbrella of Down Syndrome Ireland.  Our funding sources are fundraising, donations from families, course contributions from members and grant applications.  The supports the branch provides are Parent Link, early development groups, speech and language therapy for all age groups, information workshops and social activities.  The Kildare branch first introduced our adult education programme in 2012 when Down Syndrome Ireland introduced the literacy and technology hands-on, LATCH-on, adult literacy programme to Ireland.  This programme was introduced as a direct response for families who wished to have their adult person with Down's syndrome engaged in a meaningful educational experience after formal schooling.  Families felt that there was a huge void in this area for our adults over 18.  The Kildare branch has run adult literacy programmes for the past ten years which have been very well attended.  <\/p> <p>  In 2018 the branch decided to expand its adult education opportunities by introducing a horticulture project to acknowledge the different interests and strengths among our students.  After much work the branch was able to launch our new horticulture programme, An Garra&iacute; Beag, in Sallins in September 2019.  The programme was developed to provide an opportunity for our adult members to develop skills and to have meaningful engagement in training and practice in horticulture, and so that our members would have opportunities to use those skills to make a real contribution in their local communities and to engage in some small opportunities of social enterprise.  Pre-Covid-19 we had 20 students attending over two days each week in Sallins.  At present we have 12 students attending in Sallins over two days and six students in our second site in Donadea.  We added the Donadea site to our programmes this year in September 2021 due to the demand for horticulture.  Our site in Sallins, because of its central location, offers our students many opportunities, including independent travel.  Many of our students travel by bus or train from Newbridge, Naas, Maynooth, Clane and Newcastle.  Our students also enjoy access to the local community to sell their produce, as well as opportunities to make meaningful contributions in the community such as engaging with Tidy Towns, keeping flowerbeds around the church tidy, providing Christmas wreaths and being an active part of what goes on in Sallins village.  The students have taken part in decorating for the St. Patrick's Day festivities and won a competition for the best Halloween display in 2021 with Kildare Community Stories.  <\/p> <p>  As our site in Donadea is in a rural setting, it offers our students a different set of experiences.  The site has room for small animals such as hens, ducks, rabbits and lambs which gives the students the chance to learn some animal husbandry.  As the site is bigger than the Sallins site, it will allow us to also grow some fruit bushes, potatoes, pumpkins and things that need more space.  The rural setting lends itself to nice walks and the group have engaged with Kildare County Council in adopting our green kilometre where the students pick litter in the area around our site.  We also hope to engage with the nature around us, for example through the installation of bird and bat boxes with BirdWatch Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Much has been written about the benefits of people engaging in gardening and nature, and the Covid-19 pandemic has proven this to be true.  In some countries horticulture is now being prescribed by doctors as a support for people who struggle with mental health or trauma.  In recent times there has been intensive research done by Professor Mary McCarron and Dr. Eimear McGlinchey of Trinity College on the subject of Alzheimer's disease and dementia in adults with Down's syndrome.  The overwhelming evidence is that people with Down's syndrome are extremely vulnerable to early onset dementia with onset being up to 20 years earlier than the average for the general population.  Equally, it is thought that up to 40% of all dementia cases can be prevented or mitigated with the right lifestyle choices.  The research suggests that the best preventative or mitigating action for our people, against the threat of early onset dementia, is to stay physically active, mentally challenged, socially included and emotionally connected.  We feel strongly that these programmes create many opportunities for our people to meet those goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rita Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":977,"content":"<p>I thank all our speakers this morning for their contributions.

I commend all of them and their organisations on the great work they have done and do.  I was interested in asking Ms Hayes and Ms Finn to elaborate on how disabled people access their services and how their organisations identify and reach out to different employers or educators.  When Mr. Kelly spoke about the interview board and how the people reacted to him it reminded me of the story a woman told me recently.  She told me her son had just graduated with a master's degree in information technology and that when she was inquiring about work with an organisation, the people were very interested until she mentioned that her son is autistic.  Suddenly they were not so interested.  That brings us back to something Ms Finn said - that many of us have a limited understanding of disability because we have no connection.  How do we address that?  Many of the speakers mentioned inclusive education.  I am very interested in how they envisage that because I know parents are always nervous, especially when their child progresses from primary to secondary school.  If their child has additional needs, they may be even more nervous and sometimes choose to send their child to a special school rather than to a mainstream school.  I wonder what the speakers' thoughts are on that.  Would they see inclusive education as being mainstream with many additional supports for people with disabilities or people with Down's syndrome?  I come from an educational background.  I taught in a school which had many students with additional needs so we had a very inclusive environment but I know not all schools are like that.  What are their thoughts on those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#D00400","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Tully.

More often than not this happens through organic contacts, whereby somebody might reach out specifically to us to ask for advice around accommodation, or they are going for an interview and want some support, or they access one of our online training sessions and attend there.

When she started primary school in 1995 there was no such thing as a special needs assistant, SNA, or a resource teacher.  She started with a junior infants teacher the same as everybody else and was in first class before an SNA came for two hours a day.  She was in second class before a resource teacher came, who was divided between five schools in a rural area.  It can be imagined how well that was divided out.  By the time she left primary school, she had the resources that made her life in school very good.  When we tried to move to secondary school, there was again a major fight and battle, and it was wearing and grinding to get there, but we did.  We got the resources and she went to secondary school.<\/p> <p>  Parents of my generation with loved ones with Down's syndrome are very aware of the progress that has been made in education.  Children who have Down's syndrome or disabilities now go to school.  I have seen the richness that has brought to the lives of many people.  However, for us, when our people turned 18, it fell off a cliff.  We now see that as the new border and boundary.  We are excited about our programmes in Kildare because we believe we have to set a thing up in an environment for success and not failure.  We have to create the bespoke scaffolding around people that makes it succeed.  We know the people in our horticulture programme.  We know each one is different from the other, in addition to the variety and spectrum of strengths and challenges they have.  We have people in our horticulture programme who could sell snow to Eskimos along with people who do not speak at all.  We have to create the interaction that will allow those people to give of their best and be recognised for their social role in society.<\/p> <p>  This is about education but I see education as everything we learn that we did not know the day before.  It is not something marked by a leaving certificate or junior certificate.  I know all those things must be part of what we do, but I see education as everything that makes people richer than they are.  For our people, the big challenge then becomes how to hold on to what they have learned.  Our people have done very well in primary and secondary school.  They have worked very hard, as have their parents and the school communities, to get them to a certain level of literacy, numeracy and skills.  If they do not have real and inclusive opportunities to use those skills, whether it is in further education, bespoke further education or supported further education, or supported and bespoke employment opportunities, they will lose those skills.  The loss of those skills means loss of independence, which will affect their mental health, and a significant amount of potential will be lost to society.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example.  Yesterday, the group I work with at the polytunnel in Donadea, adopted the green kilometre along our walk.  In any village or town in Ireland on any weekend, people in high-vis vests will be seen out collecting litter and someone will say to himself or herself, \"Aren't they great people?\", because they enhance our surroundings, our environment and our lives.  They make a lovely contribution to the quality of our lives.  Our people were out yesterday in their high-vis vests, with their pickers or whatever, and that is what people would have said.  They would not have said these are people with Down's syndrome, but they are great people because they are making a valued social contribution.  That is education too.  We have made major progress in primary and secondary schools.  We are now at a new frontier and we must push on that barrier again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Rita Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":990,"content":"<p>I will circle back to the earlier question on how people access my service.  It is called Connect4Work and is a service primarily aimed at employers but is very much in support of the employee who is either in work at present but at risk of an absence because there is a challenge going on in his or her life, or that employee is already absent and is now trying to return to his or her job and work.  It is all about exploring reasonable accommodations, putting together a return-to-work plan to make sure the person can return to his or her job in a gradual way that is supported.  It includes support of the application process for any grants the employer can apply for that will allow the employee to make that transition back.  It is generally employers that will contact me, but individuals sometimes contact me and we transfer them to working with an employer.  I am based in Galway but I offer the service nationwide.  I have connected with Christabelle Feeney in the Employers for Change service.  I also link in with different organisations and different supports.<\/p> <p>  I cannot speak for education but from my experience of working with organisations, as I referenced earlier, if people do not have experience of disability, when it comes into their lives, which it might via another person with a disability, such as a work colleague or somebody they are supporting or supervising, they do not know how to talk about disability.  They may not understand that particular person's experience.  Mr. Kelly gave a very personal account of his experience.  For people living in a world where they have a disability, people outside that world do not understand it.  It is very important for people who are coming back into the workplace after they have acquired a health condition, or there is a mental health challenge, a physical disability or whatever the reason for the absence, that organisations are open to exploring reasonable accommodations.  This includes asking people what they need and what employers can do to help them to come back, engaging in conversations as early as possible and keeping people connected with work so they can return to work in a very safe, planned and sustainable way.  This is so they do not end up exiting the workforce, being distanced from it and trying to get back into it.  As Ms Hayes and others have mentioned, it is more difficult to get back into the workplace.  Employees might have a job coach and employers could be worried about what it means for them and how they can support it, in addition to not knowing anything about it and not understanding it.  <\/p> <p>  That is where I am coming from.  When there is inclusive education and children coming through classrooms where they experience disability, for example, my children, who are in classes with others with many different capabilities, they do not see those other students as being anything different.  They are just the girls and boys in their class.  They see it as nothing different.  I know that when my children get into college and working life, if they are placed in a position of having to support somebody, it will not be a huge thing because they know how to ask questions of the people in their class, such as \"Can I help you?\" and \"What do you need from me?\"  That is why having mainstream education with much more supports, as Ms Walsh mentioned, is the way to go forward.  When we have inclusive education and everybody comes through the same system, they have a better understanding and know how to ask questions.  I hope that answers Deputy Tully's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":991,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I sometimes feel the participants in our programme are very fortunate because they have a lot of support networks within our own organisation but, every week, people with very different disabilities and impairments will contact my office from anywhere around the country.  There are a couple of pinch points.  One is when people who have attended mainstream schools leave them and go to college.  They start courses and it does not work out and they do not fit in.  They find that transition piece of going to college, leaving home and trying to find a new support network difficult.  Maybe their social skills just do not back them up whereas everybody else has that opportunity.  We often find that people are falling out of courses and going back home, and they are not quite sure about their options and choices.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the other pinch point I am coming across, I had a call yesterday from a third level student who has gone through accountancy exams but is not being supported by the employer to complete exams.  There is no support out there for that person to try to move into employment.  A lot more needs to be done in this area to give some form of transition support.  As I said, parents whose children have gone through the mainstream system are coming back to ask if there is any possibility they can access Ability@Work or Cope Foundation services.  That is sad because people should be able to get the same services in the mainstream as what we offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Hennessy"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":993,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I have a number of questions that I will go through and I will mention the person I might like to answer.  I will go in the order of the presentations.<\/p> <p>  We first had Ms Hayes from the Open Doors initiative.  Ms Hayes spoke about the need to transform employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  I could not agree more because the figures are very stark with regard to young people and older people with disabilities having the opportunity to have meaningful work experience and earn their own money.  What would Ms Hayes&rsquo;s key recommendations be with regard to what is needed?  She might outline what she thinks is needed in regard to improvements in grants or supports to encourage, support and sustain people in that situation.<\/p> <p>  Ms Finn spoke about the need for disability awareness in schools, which is very important, and she might have particular suggestions around that.  I am also interested to know how her organisation supports business organisations to create that culture of openness for diversity, inclusion and disability.  It is about helping to create that culture.  Ms Finn mentioned schools and it is obviously needed in schools.  I think we are actually getting there with schools but a lot of work needs to be done within work and business organisations.  Children grow with children, and where children are in a classroom with some of their peers with disabilities, it is completely natural and part of their world.  However, work life is that little bit different.<\/p> <p>  I know the excellent work the Cope Foundation does and I have some experience of it.  Ms Hennessy talked about the need for the post-school training and upskilling that the foundation does, which is quite similar to what Ms Walsh was talking about.  There is a particular gap that needs to be addressed by giving those sustainable supports to employers as well.  Is the Cope Foundation fully back up and running after the pandemic?  I am interested in that because we are at a stage where society is starting to open up.  We need to make sure that those supports and the different agencies that work with people with disabilities are up and running, which is needed.<\/p> <p>  On a point to Mr. Kelly, or should I say &ldquo;Mr. President&rdquo;, I am incredibly impressed by his presentation.  I am sorry he had a negative experience when he was interviewing for a job.  If he was interviewing for a job here, he would definitely be the first to get it.  He gave an excellent presentation.  He should be very proud of the work he does on the Ability Board and he is on the button in what he said about Easy to Read.  We all need to learn lessons about that.  Perhaps Mr. Kelly could tell us a little about the supports that helped him in terms of progressing to be the man he is now.<\/p> <p>  I want to go next to Ms Walsh and Ms Gorey, whom I know very well.  They are two incredible volunteers who do tremendous work for the families of those with Down&rsquo;s syndrome throughout Kildare.  I know they both have the experience, as mothers.  Throughout this whole committee, we have been talking about lived experience all along, and they certainly bring that in terms of the work they are doing.  I was fortunate to visit  the services they provide a few times, particularly the horticultural services.  As Ms Walsh outlined, that has really become part of the whole village of Sallins in terms of how they work with the Tidy Towns and other groups, which is fantastic.<\/p> <p>  In particular, I would like to ask Ms Walsh about the gap that now exists between education and health.  Their service is volunteer led but, obviously, tutors have to be paid for.  Previously, this was paid through a section 39 organisation and the health budget.  It was then decided that as this was education, it should come through the education budget and the education and training boards, ETBs, but only ETBs in Dublin are actually providing that link.  I acknowledge that we had meetings with the Ministers of State, Deputies Anne Rabbitte and Niall Collins, on trying to define where that funding piece can come from.  However, there still is no solution in that regard and there needs to be.  Ms Walsh might address that gap because, to me, it is shocking that there is not a plan in place for those who are leaving school at 18 to give them the opportunity to retain what they have and to learn.<\/p> <p>  Ms Walsh also spoke about the link between Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's and the very stark figures in that regard.  I know there is the possibility of doing a pilot project over five years, which would be very helpful in defining strategies that could help.  We all know that research and facts are needed but I do not think any such research has been carried out in Ireland.  Ms Walsh might address that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#F00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":995,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I call Ms Hayes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#F00500","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":996,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for the questions.  I will take them in two pieces.  In terms of key recommendations in order to improve the experience of people with disabilities moving into education, the Open Doors initiative works with anyone who is 17 and upwards, so I can only speak to third level and further education, although that might be helpful in this instance.  As Ms Walsh has already pointed out, there is a bit of a drop when people get to that point.  The way we generally approach our training, in particular awareness training, is that we are moving from the medical model to the social model.  We no longer put the onus of resolving the issue or problem on the shoulders of the person with a disability, and we look at it from a social perspective and in terms of what systems are actually creating the issues.<\/p><p>From speaking to different employers and some educators, I know there is much fear.  Ms Finn has spoken about this.  The Senator is on about people's lack of awareness and knowledge and a fear of offending.  A hugely important and vital thing that we could do for our educators moving forward is to introduce disability awareness training as part of professional development, and not just as one course, but as something that is continued on.  <\/p><p> It would be incredibly helpful if we had a standard of accessibility for lectures and learning spaces.  From Covid, we have seen different tech improve.  For example, we have closed captioning on MS Teams now.  We can access all of this supportive technology that should be utilised within the classroom.  This information should be shared with our educators and lecturers.  <\/p><p> As part of the standard of training, it will create an awareness and permanence and the ability to have those conversations.  Most importantly, we will teach our educators to see the potential of their students.  It is not about learning how to teach people with a disability, it is about being aware and able to see their full potential and guide them properly on their career paths.  I hope that covers the key recommendations.  I do not want to take up too much time focusing on that piece.<\/p><p> In terms of grants and supports, the feedback I have come across from our participants is that they struggle to find what they need, to gather it and figure who they need to speak to.  I know things have started to change a little bit so there are some more centralised hubs and there are different organisations.  However, one of the things we are looking and hoping to build is a centralised hub of resources that could point and signpost people to where they need to seek support.  The hub could inform people of what grants are available and also include a really simple way of showing how a person&rsquo;s supports or grants will be impacted if he or she takes up employment or education &ndash; for example, \"at this level, this is how it will change\".  That way, people will have a full sight and a full picture.  At the moment, we are finding fear across all educators and our participants.  This fear of not knowing is creating a barrier as well and a lack of confidence in the knowledge that they have.  Opening up a hub or some sort of centralised online system where people can find out that information immediately and in an easy an accessible way could be very important.  I hope that answers the Senator&rsquo;s questions and I am happy to fill out any more she may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":998,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  On her first question about schools, that is not an area I work.  As a parent of children in school, I have ideas about it.  I might answer that question through her second question, which was on how my organisation promotes cultures of inclusivity in businesses.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, the service is working with employers and employees.  Perhaps I will demonstrate how the services happen and that fosters cultures of inclusion by way of example.  The goal of the service is not to be focusing on the absence, but more to promote attendance, ability and retention.  An example is that I have been supporting one particular person who is coming back to work after being away for more than two years.  One of the main reasons for her absence was that she acquired a visual impairment.  She works in an area that is very technical.  There is an awful lot of very technical and long documents that she needs to read through.  Therefore, we have put in place a text-to-speech reading software for her so that she now has the option to turn this feature on and have the text read to her.  While all of this was going on and being put in place and the most suitable solution was being researched for her, training was being provided to her so she would be able to use the software.  The training is equally as important as just providing the accommodation.  Sometimes when reasonable accommodations, by way of access or technology, are put in place, people do not always get full training on how to use it, leaving them not knowing how to use it and with no supports. <\/p> <p>  In supporting the manager to assist his or her employee, I made the suggestion to make this available to the entire team.  It will be a benefit to this particular individual and it will also benefit the entire time, because they then all have the option to have the text read to them, which would help them to get through their work perhaps a little bit quicker.  It would certainly be easier for them if they have to read a very heavy and technically jargoned document at the end of a long day.  Now the organisation is looking into making that technology available to everybody. <\/p> <p>  This is how my work supports organisations to foster cultures of inclusion.  If that organisation is now going out and recruiting for that team, it can say that this is a feature and it would be easier for everybody to be able to do their work.  They are now not just looking at the text-to-speech readers, they are also now looking at speech-to-text translators as well.  It will work both ways. <\/p> <p>  Very often when one looks at a reasonable accommodation for a person, it actually works to the benefit of their wider team.  I could keep everyone here today giving many more examples, but do not worry, I will not.  I hope that answers the Senator&rsquo;s question.  My focus is on ability, attendance and retention and how that extends to the rest of the team and the entire organisation by making it inclusive and supportive of people.  <\/p> <p>  At the end of the day, we are all people.  We all want to be in work.  Work is a huge part of our identity.  If one can support an individual, that then creates opportunities for others who might be experiences challenges to say, \"Mickey Joe over there was supported when he was coming back.  I also have a challenge, so I will be supported in a similar compassionate and empathic manner as well.  Therefore, I will not be afraid to ask for supports.\"  That is part of the wider goal I have for my organisation, to support organisations to be much more open and disability confident in their conversations and to know how to ask questions.  I hope that answers the Senator&rsquo;s question.  If she has any other questions, I would be happy to answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":999,"content":"<p>Ms Hennessy is on mute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#G00300","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>To answer the Senator&rsquo;s question, we were very fortunate that our services continued through Covid-19.  We managed to offer service online.  In fact, we had 24 people on our programme working as front-line workers through the pandemic.  We had to look at our programme and see what we could do to improve our employment options.  We looked to the pharmaceutical companies and to the retail sector and found job opportunities in these areas.<\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke about gaps in the post training and upskilling area and the only way we can address all these issues is by having a person-centred approach.  This is something we have done in Ability@Work.  We were delivering a programme for about a year and thought we were doing fine until we sat down and asked the participants in the programme about what they think, want and need.  This is what we need in these decisions and making decisions here today.  We need to be asking the people who have the lived experience.  We have no idea what type of world they are in and the barriers they are facing.<\/p><p>We write up and deliver programmes, but have we really considered asking people whether we are meeting their needs and what accommodations they need?  That is a big gap.  We are great at talking to and about people but I do not know whether we really include them and ask them for their opinions, and that is something we need to do.<\/p><p> I am a strong believer in examining pathways alternative to the traditional one, that is, from secondary school to vocational training centres and day services.  We need to offer alternatives for people, no matter what their ability is.  They are entitled to access mainstream services but much work has to be done to offer the proper supports.  I refer not just to scribes and personal assistants but a proper wraparound service for people in order that they can enjoy third level education or be part of the workforce.  I cannot say strongly enough how much we need to educate employers.  Every week, we knock on doors in Cork and bring the same message.  After working with businesses for 30 years, I still meet people who do not understand what it is to have an inclusive workforce.  They do not understand what supported employment is, nor appreciate that people can have different ways of learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Hennessy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>Without the supports of Ability@Work, I would not be where I am today nor have a job.  I applied for jobs previously on my own and got nowhere, but I got there with the support of Ability@Work.  Before all this came about, I felt powerless but now, having been elected president of the ability board, I feel as though I have power.  I am supporting not just myself but many other people just like me, with intellectual or other disabilities.  It is so important for someone with a disability to have his or her own voice.  As I said earlier, we are often treated like children and decisions are made for us, instead of us being asked what we would like to do and how we would like to go about it.  With Ability@Work, we teach a lot more than we are taught.  The people involved learn from us and always ask us what we want to do, what courses we are interested in and what we foresee as our career for the rest of our lives, and they try to set up that.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that without Ability@Work, I would not be where I am today.

My daughter left school in 2009, having studied modules in the leaving certificate applied, and the question was what she would do next.  When we did some research, the only options involved the local service provider, and the funding for that was routed through the HSE.  Because there were no other options, we engaged with that, but it quickly became obvious to us that it did not suit her.  Not only did it not meet her needs but it was detrimental to her mental health.  We had to do something about that, so we started to create a programme for her by ourselves outside of that.  We had to find the funding we needed to do that because there was no other option.<\/p> <p>  In 2013, I started to hear about personalised budgets.  I attended a seminar on the subject in Killarney and began to feel passionately that they might be the way to go.  With a lot of negotiation, work and lobbying as a family, we got a personalised budget in 2014, as part of a pilot scheme.  To say it was transformative to my daughter's life would be an understatement.  She now had a level of autonomy over her life, supported by us.  We should, and do, have a natural authority in her life because we are the people who have been there since the day she was born and we know her best.  We were able to create a life for her that she wanted.  It was diverse and had all the elements that all of us consider to constitute a good life.  It had elements of education and work and there was somebody to support her in a very bespoke way.  It was not a case of one size fits all but rather a size that fitted her and her alone, and that has continued to this day.  It has greatly enhanced the quality of life for not just her but for us too because we know where it is and we are part of the plan.<\/p> <p>  I met fantastic people within service provision but it just was not for her.  She was part of the national task force on personalised budgets, launched by the then Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Finian McGrath, in 2016, and that offered great hope that this would become more widely available to people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  This year, we held a meeting in our branch with parents of students who are finishing forming school.  It is difficult to see how the opportunities for them are any different from what they used to be.  In Kildare, we had a really good relationship with the HSE and service providers and we are grateful for that.  They supported many of the members who were going to certain service providers to access our programmes.  Our literacy and horticulture programmes are bespoke in that they take great recognition of the learning strengths and challenges of people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome and their learning profile.  Even to teach a lesson in our horticulture programme, the providers will be aware there are three levels, whereby some people are visual learners, so visual aids will be used with them, while others can read and write quite well.  We have to be constantly aware that some people use pictures for everything they communicate, whereas others can write quite well.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the gap between education and health.  For me, it is about creating a good life, irrespective of which funding budget it comes from or whatever.  It should be a life that meets what most of us consider to be a good life.  We need much more flexibility in respect of how funding is allocated for people with disabilities.  Even the HSE has indicated that it needs to be more creative and think outside the box.  We tend to change the needs of the people rather than the structures that underpin the funding.  As our people age, with the significant threat of early-onset dementia, education and health become intrinsically linked given that, if a person is to hold on to the literacy he or she has learned, he or she must also hold on to a word bank and language skills.  The question, therefore, is whether the two issues can really be separated in that way.  It is not about deciding whether it is a matter of health or education but instead what is the best approach for these people, rather than from where the budget comes.<\/p> <p>  To follow on from a point the Senator made, we at Down Syndrome Ireland are very proud of our work with the education and training boards, ETBs, and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It will be very significant for our people that programmes within the ETBs will meet their needs as they leave school.  Currently, there are very few options when they leave school to continue into further education, and that will be brilliant.  Beyond that time, when our people are not school-leavers but are entering their late 20s and early 30s, when they will still require that literacy challenge and mental challenge to militate against early-onset dementia, with all those sorts of engagement, it does not really matter whether it is an issue of health or education but rather that the support is there.<\/p><p>It is about living ordinary lives in ordinary places with ordinary people for all of us.  It is not spectacular; it is not the cure for Down's syndrome.  It is about meeting that need and, as one of the speakers said, providing a wraparound bespoke solution keeping it all together.<\/p><p> The Senator also spoke about the research on Alzheimer's disease and dementia.  As a parent of somebody with Down's syndrome, the first time I heard about the research I was floored.  I wanted to go home and hide under the duvet since I felt all the work we had put in was for nothing because the actual scientific research said this was coming down the track.  The hope from that seminar with Professor Mary McCarron was that we can mitigate it and give the best quality of life to our people.  We can push the can down the road and mitigate the symptoms and stresses of early onset dementia by how we allow our people to live their lives.  That is why we need be inventive and need to change.  That is why it needs to be bespoke.  I implore the Government to look at personalised budgets and individualised funding and make it a realistic option for our people.  It is for Government to decide how that will be done, but it needs to be there and it needs to be bespoke.  I hope I have answered all the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rita Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their contributions.  Ms Walsh said the aspiration is for ordinary lives in ordinary places with ordinary people.  My experience is with people going into employment on a community employment scheme.  They are afraid to ask about security of tenure and whether they will be employed afterwards because they are afraid to rock the boat.  In some instances, informal arrangements are in place and nobody really wants to ask the question in case asking the question brings about a termination, especially if the funding is extended in an unofficial or informal manner.  That is not on and needs to end.  Everyone has the right to know about their future and if they will still be working there rather than in such temporary arrangements.  That is where I have encountered it, working with families of people with Down's syndrome or autism.  We need to ensure people are supported to live their best lives, to borrow that phrase from Cheeverstown.<\/p> <p>  How radical does our thinking need to be?  My background is in employment law and in assisting companies with ethical audits to ensure the goods they source do not involve human trafficking etc.  Big companies oblige smaller suppliers to overcome hurdles to ensure they are proofed against reputational damage.  There may be a template in that.  To secure a public contract through eTenders or similar, there may be an opportunity to introduce radical thinking requiring employers to demonstrate they have looked at all their job descriptions and determined how to enable people with disabilities to apply for and secure those jobs.  We should do something radical and different and have this in any application so that we are forcing it.<\/p> <p>  We introduced quotas for female candidates in elections because otherwise it would not happen.  We should be thinking about a radical shake-up here.  When we consider the marginalisation and poverty that comes with disability, we need to address that for everybody not just the person themselves but also the families who fear for what the future will look like when they are older and want to ensure some kind of security.  How radical do we need to be?  I want to enable that conversation and I would welcome the witnesses' comments.<\/p> <p>  In her presentation Ms Hynes outlined that she deals with Departments.  I would like her to elaborate on that.  Obviously, the Minister of State is obliging all Departments to prepare themselves for the adoption of the optional protocol.  She has reassured us that they are all engaging radically.  If Ms Hynes has been involved in supporting that, I would like to hear that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelly's presentation was inspirational and challenging.  I love that he wants to be the person to go in and train companies.  Is his organisation funded to do that?  Should it be?  What can we call for on his behalf to ensure that?  At the moment we have the threshold of employment accessibility whereby disabled people should not be discriminated against but clearly that is not working.  As an employment lawyer, I have been on both sides of the table, on behalf of the employer and the employee.  To enable him to command even more authority than he has as president of the ability board, should we require employers to prove they have engaged with the potential for diversity of employment that would enhance their employment as well as having a diverse workforce?  Would Mr. Kelly like to see us do anything like that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#J00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.

Mr. Kelly and his group are trying to set up a social enterprise.  There are ten or 12 people on the board and they want to be self-employed.  Their idea is reaching out to companies.  It is not even an idea; we have done it already with six companies in Cork.  It is amazing to see the impact and the change when the people on the Ability Board are part of the disability awareness for a company.  One company now employs six people and another employs six or seven people on the back of Mr. Kelly and Jamie speaking during disability awareness training.<\/p><p>This is a unique opportunity for the committee to look at helping to fund or set up Mr. Kelly and the Ability Board to help people nationally.  It is a toolkit we can develop and share with other groups in order that the right people are making the right decisions and the right comments with the proper support.<\/p><p> To answer the question about radical thinking, we need to talk to people in recruitment.  We know about the screening of CVs and that, with the automated online systems, it is getting more advanced.  It is getting very difficult for the people I support and those Mr. Kelly interacts with.  In fact, it is even challenging for the job coaches at the moment.  I had a conversation one day with a HR manager in a company.  He said, in his 15 years with the company, he had never once interviewed a person with a disability and asked why they were not applying to his company, which is a very well-known one in Cork.  I asked him to show me a typical advert.  When you put things in like \"excellent communications skills\", you are automatically going to exclude somebody who has a hearing issue or maybe a speech difficultly.  It is those criteria companies automatically put in without even thinking.  Where I work it was essential to have a full driving licence.  It did not matter what the role was.  It was just one of the criteria.  These are small and simple changes.  By bringing in people like Mr. Kelly, looking at the recruitment and getting advice at that stage, maybe we can open up the pathway a little more.<\/p><p> There can be much focus also on skills and aptitudes but maybe what we need to start looking at in companies or talking to them about is getting a person who is a good fit, because people can be trained.  People can learn a job but it is far more important this person has the social skills, teamwork skills, ability and commitment to the company.  One of the things I do when I visit companies in Cork is go on a walk-around and do a job analysis.  I break down the job into all its components and see how I would match someone to a job.  However, often I am in a company - it could be a manufacturing one or an IT one - where you would think some of the people we support might not have the skill sets.  We ask them to carve out jobs.  What are the occasional or weekly jobs we can break down into maybe a couple of hours a week that would open up an employment opportunity to somebody?  We need to get away from the traditional, full-time, 39-hour a week job and look at different options and jobs people could do for four hours of a morning per week.  In the public service as well it is something that needs to be opened up.  People are hamstrung with regulation and red tape and many Departments to not have the flexibility to carve out jobs.<\/p><p> Another point is the wage subsidy scheme available where people can work for 21 hours per week.  That is a great incentive to employers to open up opportunities.  Many people we support are working an average of maybe 15 hours per week.  That is something that could be addressed if we looked at reducing the hours for people who might have more complex needs or impairments.<\/p><p> I will finish with two other comments.  I am working with a retail chain at the moment.  It has committed to us that, every time it opens a store, it wants to employ somebody with an intellectual disability.  That is a challenge for me in Cork because in every town in Cork I need to ensure I have a job coach present being able to support the person.  The chain reached out to me throughout the year and said it wanted to roll this out nationally to every town in Ireland.  There is a shop in every town in Ireland but I do not know whether there is a backup service to support the person.  There are plenty of people available to go and work but we just do not have the supports.  What was nice with this person recently was they employed a person with very complex needs on the autism spectrum.  Due to the all the difficulties of Covid-19, this person is struggling to get back to where he was and has decided he does not want to return to work.  That company has come back to me and asked can I ensure that, if I get somebody again for a job for it, he or she is a person to whom no one else will give a job.  That is an amazing shift in thinking from an employer who has had that lived experience with a person we support.  They are the recommendations I would make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Hennessy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>Does anyone else want to respond to Senator Seery Kearney's questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#K00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>One of the things that came to mind when Ms Hennessy was speaking was one of our students doing horticulture.  We were collecting tomatoes and I was working with him.  He was absolutely meticulous.  Every tomato was taken down perfectly.  No tomatoes were squished on the floor whereas I was losing a good percentage of mine on the floor but he got every single one.  If he was to go for an interview where it said \"excellent communication\", he would not have got past the first bar because his communication is quite poor.  He is meticulous in everything he does.  He is meticulous in how tidy he keeps everything.  Sometimes I think if we can capture the skill of people, even using video footage and things like that, then when we have the skill the person has, maybe we can look for the fit-out in the community where that skill is needed rather than sometimes trying to find out what kind of qualification this person has and then going looking for the job.  We could instead find out what skill he or she has and see where that can take them then.  That might be another way of looking at it.<\/p> <p>  Like Ms Hennessy said, it is very important the right supports are put in so someone is set up for success.  If there is success with one person, that has a huge trickle effect across the board.  If it is a success for the employer and employee, they are much more courageous about doing it again and about saying to some other employer to have a go at it and take a chance because it had been good for the original employer.  Again, when we in Down Syndrome Ireland are working with employers, we find the employees themselves sometimes sell the whole concept.  They are the ambassadors for it and the people who draw others in.  Some people in hospitality say if there are employers attending those hospitality settings, sometimes seeing those people there actually triggers in them that maybe they will give it a chance too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rita Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>I think Senator Seery Kearney had a question for Ms Hayes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#K00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the question.  I will start with whether we need radical thinking and change.  I second everything Ms Hennessy and Ms Walsh have brought up about how it is not about radical thinking but instead these little steps in changing the language from the job advertisement to the interview process to when somebody starts in a role.  Asking somebody to have a full driving licence when there is no requirement to travel does not make any sense.  There is no logic behind that.  It is just something that has always been done.  It is about acknowledging there are things within the system we have always done such as \"good communications\" and \"fast-paced environment\" and asking what these things mean in reality to the person doing the job.  It should be about the person's skills.<\/p> <p>  If we begin to create a culture through disability awareness training with employers, we can start to create better job advertisements that encourage other people to apply for them.  From the get-go there should always be an equality statement with a job advertisement so the person who is applying knows he or she is going to be working for an inclusive employer.  Mr. Kelly pointed to this.  He said he would not want to work for this person if this is how they are going to treat him.  He did not want to work for somebody who is going to dismiss his application because he has disclosed he has a disability.  That is a really key piece.  Reasonable accommodations should be offered at every step of the process, from saying there are such accommodations available when you advertise the job, throughout the interview process - however many interviews there are - and then again when a person starts in a role.  A person with a disability is under no obligation to disclose he or she has a disability at any point.  It is entirely up to him or her to share that information.<\/p><p>What we should be doing from an employer's perspective is encouraging a culture where people feel comfortable sharing, in order that they can ask for the reasonable accommodations they need to best succeed in their role.<\/p><p> When it comes to radical steps, I do not think these things are radical.  They are very simple things we can do to make a huge difference.  AHEAD did a study in 2019 and found that two out of the three reasonable accommodations that an employee asked for cost the employer nothing.  There was no cost to them and the cost of the third was very minimal.  We can make very small changes that can have huge impacts on a person's experience in employment and further education.  The question was specifically about employment.<\/p><p> It is funny that the Senator mentioned gender quotas for elections.  We have a target within public service employment as part of the comprehensive strategy for people with disabilities.  We are looking for a minimum of 3%, which will increase to 6% in 2024.  I am not quite sure where we are on that percentage at the moment.  It is an interesting piece that has been brought up.<\/p><p> I do not think what we need is radical thinking.  We need awareness and education.  As I have mentioned before, there are a lot of fear-based reactions.  People are afraid of saying the wrong thing or not doing the right thing so they avoid the conversation or they do not do what needs to be done.  We need more education, more conversations and more awareness so employers can do better and then employees and colleagues can do better as well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>My apologies, I was present for the start of the meeting and the presentations but unfortunately - or fortunately - I had to speak in the D&aacute;il.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  As a former lecturer in GMIT, I have experience of some people with disabilities being educated and getting their degrees.  The good news is that those people are now in gainful employment.  They are still in contact with us and are doing well.  One of the things I found about those students was that they were the centre of the class because they were so charged up for the challenge of getting an education.  It is important that we nurture that in people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  In my view, we need to start with educating our teachers and children about disabilities and how disabilities affect people.  We should give people who are in the classroom with people with disabilities a better understanding and there should be more integration to make it a normal thing.  What is wrong with employers is that there is a fear, when taking on somebody with a disability, about how that might work out for them or how might it affect other workers in the organisation.  There is a fear factor so we need to provide education reassurance.<\/p> <p>  Are there data on how many people who go into second level education with disabilities gain employment and how many go into third level?  Do we have statistics around that or an indication of how successful we are in that regard?  When people with disabilities go into work, how many of them get permanent work and how much of it could be deemed tokenism?  What else can we do as Oireachtas Members and as a committee to ensure everyone is treated fairly as regards education and employability?  That is a lot of questions.<\/p> <p>  I recognise the work everybody is doing.  I want to say hello to Ms Finn from Galway, who is from my own constituency.  We have had discussions on the phone.  She is a great advocate and is very interesting to talk to.  I am delighted she is here today.  I will just throw that open to the floor for the witnesses' feedback on my thinking and what we should be doing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#L00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Canney.  I remember our conversation, which is what started the process of me being here today.  There is an awful lot to do.  There is a huge opportunity to make the future of work more inclusive.  As someone alluded to - I cannot remember who as there has been so much commentary - things in education are changing as the current generation goes through the school system.  My daughter refers to herself as Gen Z.  She says Gen Z think this or that and they think differently to us.  As they progress through school and on in life, they will have a different way of thinking and a different approach.  My girls do not see the students in their class who have additional needs as being any different.  It is just who they are and is part of them; it is nothing different.  The mindset that some of us of a different or older generation might have is not going to be the same as theirs.<\/p> <p>  On Senator Seery Kearney's question about radical thinking, there are so many things in place already.  I do not know if it is necessarily a matter of radical thinking but of using what we have already.  There are lots of tools available and I will highlight two in particular.  For those who may not be familiar with JAM cards, the JAM stands for \"just a minute\".  They have appeared throughout retail units such as Penneys and our local Eurospar is using them.  Retail units using these cards will give extra time and additional supports to customers who might need help finding items in the shop or so on.  Employers might also have employees wearing these JAM cards to indicate that when they are asked a question they might need a minute or two to process it.  There are tools there.<\/p> <p>  The other tool I would highlight is the reasonable accommodation passport, which was launched in 2019 in collaboration with IBEC and ICTU.  Initially it was designed as a tool for people with a disability in work to communicate what accommodations they might need.  In an effort to make that an inclusive tool that is open to everybody, it can be used right throughout the lifetime of every employee.  Ms Hayes mentioned that 80% of people acquire their disability after the age of 16, which indicates that most people acquire their disability while in the workforce and during their working life.  We need to look at the employee experience from the minute someone starts engaging with an employer as a potential employee in the recruitment process.  For example, when applying for jobs, can they submit a video application rather than a written one?  Taking that right through to the point where they retire or leave that organisation, we need to look at how that whole employee journey can be supported to make it more inclusive, by using things such as the reasonable accommodation passport if someone has a challenge, a health condition or a disability.  That is available to everybody so everyone should know they can use that at any stage if they have a challenge, a mental health challenge or even a temporary physical challenge that they need some support with.  When people know their employers are open to talking about these things and are supportive and using tools like that, it makes it much more inclusive.<\/p><p>That is my tuppence worth on those few tools that are there - no radical thinking, only using what is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Finn.

I agree with the Deputy on his first point about the supports and resources for teachers to help them to have a better understanding on integration.  The day-to-day life of a teacher in school who is working with 25, 29 or 30 students in a class, one or two of whom possibly have learning difficulties or other issues, is challenging.  Such teachers have a piece of work to do.  They have a curriculum to teach.  They have deadlines to meet.  Where we can, we should support them by offering them alternative learning methods and resources, and possibly having people with various different abilities coming in and talking to them during training sessions to give them an insight into what works best.  I have great respect for the work teachers do.  They set out the foundations for their pupils' experiences in life in future.  I would like to see as much support as possible for teachers in that way.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second comment was about the fear he feels employers have.  He really nailed it when he spoke about how employers feel, for example with regard to how it will affect everybody else if they bring a person with a disability into the workplace.  That is where we need to stop and think.  Why should there be a big deal about it?  Why should there be fear?  Everybody is equal.  Just because you have a physical disability, a hearing impairment or a visual impairment, why should it be such a big deal?<\/p> <p>  Every day I come across this with employers.  Years ago, you would get an excuse around health and safety.  This would be the first barrier that would be put up when you would ask about a job for somebody.  Why is there fear?  Why are we so afraid of disability?  What is so different about this cohort of people from us?  Why is it a difference?  Why is it a distinction?  That is where the nub of the problem is.  Maybe this is where, through information and education sessions, there can be assistance.  The feedback I get from employers when our Ability Board speaks on our disability awareness training involves them asking what the big deal is.  Mr. Kelly nailed it earlier this morning in what he was saying.<\/p> <p>  There are certain people, particularly people in HR in their 40s, 50s and 60s, who can possibly go through their life, career and college life without coming into contact with a person with a disability.  They have said it to me.  It is a different experience now with young people.  Fear comes into play if people are not exposed to disability and have no experience of it.  That is why people, such as Mr. Kelly, need to be talking to employers to change those mindsets and stereotypes, and to look at those blocks.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Canney mentioned the data baseline.  It is probably difficult to get those figures because we are then into the area of disclosure.  Many people have fought hard to get where they are and when they go into a job, they may not want to disclose to their employer that they have a disability.  That is very much a personal choice.  The Deputy is correct that there can be an awful lot of tokenism around giving a person a job.  Particularly in some companies, it is a case of ticking off the box for their corporate social responsibility or their quota figures.  That is an issue.  We weed those employers out because if people are coming from that perspective when they are employing somebody, it will not work out and it will not be worthwhile.<\/p> <p>  What we need to do is get the message out there that there is no difference.  Everybody should be and is equal.  I accept we might need something a little bit different.  I am sure I learn differently from the Deputy.  I am a visual person and I have to write down and use lists, and for somebody else it would be different.  We need to get that message out there to companies.<\/p> <p>  There is a business case here to be made to companies.  There is significant spending power among the number of people with disabilities in Ireland.  As someone previously mentioned, one in four of us will end up with a disability in our lifetime.  We certainly will all come into contact with somebody in our families with a disability throughout our lifetime.<\/p> <p>  We need to change.  We need to get serious about this.  I am 30 years in this business and I have yet to see a proper commitment through employment to include everybody.

Recently, I heard that a classmate of hers had a baby with Down's syndrome.  Society has caught up.  As Ms Finn said, the children of today are going to school and sitting in classrooms with children with Down's syndrome and all sorts of disabilities.  That will go up through life with them.<\/p> <p>  I believe there is a culture and an environment where people want to do the right thing.  They want to be inclusive.  It is a question of how you make it happen from there.<\/p> <p>  For employers, there is fear.  There is a fear of getting it wrong.  There is a fear of it not working out.  In some ways, I can understand that fear.  That is why it is so important that the supports are there to allow them to do it right.  Also, maybe it would be lovely to start to applaud those who have got it right and to make them the heroes.  I refer to the ones who have got it right and made good, comfortable, fair and equal environments for their employees.<\/p> <p>  Teachers now at least receive some training modules in disability.  It obviously can only be limited.  A teacher may have received training on aspects of how people with Down's syndrome learn or the challenges they are posed with but that will not provide everything because people with Down's syndrome, like all other people, are a spectrum of people and have a variety of challenges and strengths.  If a bank of information could be available to teachers - maybe this is the case - within the Department, a teacher who is teaching a child with a specific disability could go to that bank of information and get more specific information that would help him or her in the classroom and help the other classmates in the school as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Rita Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for appearing before us today.

Will Mr. Kelly tell us what Easy to Read is and how businesses and public bodies can get involved?<\/p><p> Ms Hennessy discussed the need for a change to the culture of low expectation for people with additional and more complex impairments.  We all know cultural shifts are incredibly important but take a frustratingly long time to change.  What specific measures should we be pushing for to help achieve that?  To draw on a different example, there has been a lot of recent public discussion of issues around domestic and gender-based violence.  We know a big cultural shift is required and how we address that is a big challenge.  There are also obvious things that can be done by the Government immediately, such as providing an adequate number of refuge spaces for people fleeing domestic violence.  There are two ways of looking at and tackling this.  What specific things does Ms Hennessy feel the Government could do now?  One example might be a quota in the public service for people with disabilities.  It would be great to hear some other examples.<\/p><p> I will focus on Dr. Brady's previous communications to this committee and its members on issues around progressing disability services for young people.

She asked about how we change the low expectations and about cultural shifts.  When we talk about supporting people with more significant or complex challenges and needs, perhaps the Government and this committee could think about running a media campaign.  We all have the radio on in the car as we are going about our business.  Perhaps we could have a television campaign that highlights people's abilities.  We all learn from visual examples.  A short clip on the television or radio could make a big difference.  We do not often see people with more significant and complex abilities speaking on television or radio.  That might be a way to move this forward.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps we could develop an advocacy campaign.  We could dedicate a year to promote these issues, through the Government.  The Deputy is right about the quotas in the public service.  While there are quotas, there must be some way of educating or guiding people on how we can open up opportunities.  I know from talking to people in the public service that there is a central recruitment process that must be gone through.  While people in local offices are very interested in the whole area of employing somebody, they can be dictated to by policy or decisions that are made elsewhere.  We have found that to be the case in the HSE.  We have been working through several of the hospitals in Cork.  Thankfully, things are opening up at the moment but it has taken almost three years to make progress in that area.  We could look at the whole area of quotas and voluntary quotas.  It would be important to encourage public services to reach out to the specialist services in their localities.<\/p> <p>  We should have sound pathways for people from secondary school onward.  Some people might not go to third level colleges but would go into post-leaving certificate courses and attend education and training board courses.  We could move away from the traditional adult services, specialist services and rehabilitative training that is there.  Perhaps we could invest in new and innovative ways to do that.  I know there are many such projects throughout the country.  Pobal is compiling a report of the findings on the past three years of the Ability programme.  That will make interesting reading.

One of the biggest areas we are working on at the moment is the lack of therapy services for our members.  As the aim of this meeting is to align education here with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this would fit strongly with Article 7, which relates to children with disabilities.  The therapy provision in this country is falling so far behind it is almost meaningless and non-existent.  The progressing disabilities services programme has been set up and is ongoing but many areas still have not transitioned to the unified approach that was in the plan and, I am sure, still is in the plan.  Many areas have not made the transition to unifying the approach.  As a result, children are waiting several years on a waiting list for therapy and transitioning.  There are very few therapy supports for children transitioning from preschool to primary school.  There are very few assessment reports to back that up because the professionals are not there.  Teams have not been set up properly and are not running yet.<br\/><br\/>The regular therapy, for example, for pupils in second level education is so rare it is almost non-existent, even though these children, particularly the teenagers, have very complex language needs.  There is a lot of evidence on evidence-based therapy service requirements suggesting therapy should not just be delivered once a week on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis but should be delivered several times a week to the children who need it, in both primary and post-primary schools.  This is falling so far below the required level the research shows is necessary that it is meaningless.  In some cases, parents are having to opt for private services and employ their own speech and language therapists.  That is not an option for everybody.  It is vital the unified approach becomes active and is up and running everywhere.<br\/><br\/>I deal with a number of parents week after week.  Yesterday I was with a parent whose child has not seen a therapist of any sort, including an occupational therapist or speech and language therapist, for two and a half years. That parent does not have the option of doing it privately.  That case is duplicated throughout the country.  As Ms Hayes said earlier, this is a pure indication of where the structures, systems and procedures are impacting on the inclusion and education journey not just of young people and adults who are in further education or employment, which is the main focus of today, but right across the board at primary and post-primary schools.  It needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>We in Down Syndrome Ireland have in recent days finished a new report on the facts and figures we have gathered from our members in recent years on the issues with therapies and the progression of the unification model for disability services.

We come here every Thursday morning and we are both uplifted and depressed, but we always leave the room with determination to do what we need to do for people with disabilities to make sure they take part in whatever they want to take part in.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Kelly for being so honest in his contribution.  I hear those experiences time and again &ndash; the put-down and lack of confidence.  When people cannot get a job, it is so disempowering.  In my past I struggled to get employment, so I have a small idea of what it is like to feel rejected and dejected constantly.  I know how hard it is for some people who have a disability and are employed but are not looked after the way they should be.  I thank Mr. Kelly for his honestly and his incredible advocacy work.<\/p> <p>  My first question arises from what Ms Hayes said.  I contacted the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment a few months ago and asked what it does to support people with disabilities who are setting up their own companies.  What I got back was the mentorship and self-employment programme.  I was told there were equal opportunities and they could work with the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  We absolutely know about equal opportunities.  What I am pushing for is more equitable opportunities and to raise the bar.  What more can LEOs do for that person who just happens to have a disability but has the most incredible entrepreneurial spirit, is more than capable of setting up his or her own business and only needs that extra equitable opportunity, as I said?<\/p> <p>  Entering employment and the fear of losing allowances was mentioned, and my question in this regard goes to everybody and I would like everyone's thoughts on it.  On that cost of disability, how much of a change would it be for an individual, and I know it will be big, if there were a disability employment allowance to cover that cost of disability?  The report on the cost of disability came out a couple of months ago and we know that cost is colossal.  It was a very good report and we need to get working on it.  How much of a change would that be for an individual to know there is a disability employment allowance, benefit, or whatever they want to call it, to support someone getting to work and not to lose the supports they have?<\/p> <p>  There was a conversation about what the public sector can do, and I am always just overwhelmed by the low expectations in the public sector.  There is nothing sadder than a State public service not reaching targets, not being adaptable and not working for the employee.  What difference would it make if the assistive technology grant was individualised?  We know people in public sector do not automatically get that grant and it is down to their boss and a business case, and often they are denied that grant and left to do as they were, with no assistive technology.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hennessy, Mr. Kelly and Ms Walsh spoke about the transition between school and employment.  There is such a cliff edge at the minute with not knowing where to go and what to do.  I am a great believer in the education and training board, ETBs.  I think they are wonderful.  I was on the board Louth and Meath ETB.  They are incredible.  What more of a role could they take in being the facilitators in that transition between school and employment, whatever the employment would be, and that active role in their society?  <\/p> <p>  How can the current schemes be improved?  Mr. Kelly mentioned there are no supports for his disability awareness training.  However, private companies can get a grant that covers up to 90% to hire Mr. Kelly and the best to give disability training.  How open are those private companies to getting that grant?  How good are the wage subsidy scheme and all of those grants that are available to employers?  How functional are they?  They are there but we are not hitting where we should be.  How can we improve those grants and schemes?  How can this committee make sure we advocate for positive change to make sure those grants are actively working for the people that they are supposed to be working for?<\/p> <p>  That is a pile there.  I really appreciate our witnesses&rsquo; time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#O00600","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  I very much appreciate that.  In terms of the grants, particularly around assistive technology and awareness training, the assistive tech grants are only for private companies, as the Senator said, so this immediately excludes charities and public bodies.  It creates an issue in that sense because the individual who seeks out the grant may not be able to get it.  This assistive technology makes a huge difference to a person's experience in work, his or her ability to do the job, the person's impact on his or her team and his or her workload.  The fact the grants are only focused on private companies has come up as a bit of an issue with some of the participants I have worked with when we have to look for extra supports and figure out what route to go down and how it works.<\/p> <p>  The other thing with the assistive tech is that it stays with the company.  If a company has an employee and applies for the grant to get the assistive technology, and that employee, after a year or two or however long, moves on to another role, he or she has to go through the whole process again when starting at the new company, rather than bringing that piece of tech with him or her.<\/p> <p>  I think it was Ms Finn who earlier touched on the reasonable accommodations passport, which goes with the individual.<\/p><p>Discussing a person's reasonable accommodations and what they need within their role is part of creating that inclusive approach to how we do work and education.  It should be brought with them rather than being left as they move on.  <\/p><p> In terms of the access offices, our course with TU Dublin finished up at the end of last year and was a great success.  I mentioned previously that self-employment and entrepreneurship is an area that is rarely explored for people with disabilities.  When we talk about employment, we always assume that the person with the disability is the employee rather than the employer.  Opening up our conversation and changing how we approach that is so important.  I will have to come back to the committee on the LEOs.  We are in the middle of doing research on how the course went and our findings in that regard.  I will come back to the committee with firm facts on what we can do better when we are supporting a person with a disability on his or her entrepreneurship journey.  Mr. Kelly might want to speak on this because he is about to embark on that right now.  <\/p><p> A disability employment allowance could have an enormous impact.  At the moment, so many of the people that I speak to cannot take the risk of losing support.  If they take the risk and are left without it, how do they support themselves?  Creating a system that provides real support rather than being just a welfare support would be great.  Support that has momentum and movement and that allows people to continue to progress rather than staying stagnant would have a huge impact on a person's well-being, mental health and day-to-day life.  When people are looking for work and struggling to find it, and when they keep getting knock-backs, that can have a huge impact on their confidence.  One of the things I have seen with the participants on our projects is that from education through to employment, they have had a significant number of knock-backs.  They have faced a lack of understanding from their educator or their employer and have felt excluded, set apart or othered in certain situations.  We need to encourage people with disabilities to begin to apply for positions but we also need to educate employers, teachers and lecturers so that people with disabilities feel safe in those environments and are not being knocked back but are being included.  Social inclusion is so important, as is the feeling of belonging.  In that context, a disability employment allowance would have a massive impact.  I say that based on the experiences I have seen and the feedback I have received from participants.  <\/p><p> I will send an email with more information on the LEOs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for her questions.

In terms of the loss of allowances, the disability disregard and what else can be offered, the idea of changing that whole process is a good one.  We must look at the real costs for somebody with a disability of going to work and that is very much individualised.  People will have different needs and for some, getting to work will cost a lot more than for others.  The rigours around earnings and how much a person can earn can be problematic.  A lot of people with disabilities are only working part time, for 12-15 hours per week, to try to hold on to their disability allowance and to keep within the income levels in order to hold on to their medical card.  The loss of a medical card is something that people really worry about.  As we get older, we all need access to medical support and for some people with disabilities, the costs can be considerable the older they get.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the comments on assistive technology for the public service.  That is an excellent idea and could really open things up.  The role that the ETBs can play is significant in terms of building bridges and links.  The ETB in Cork has come on board with us this year but because of Covid, we have not been able to develop that relationship yet.  There are lots of courses, particularly QQI courses at levels 3 and 4, that people can complete and it would be very interesting to develop supported employment programmes for people around the country.  It would also be important to enable people to access courses online as well.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the fact that information is available for companies, and that is true, but in my experience while there are HR departments and diversity and inclusion committees in larger companies, the issue for many is time.  Who is the person in the company to explore this further, to look up the website and to progress it?  We are all in the business so we all understand the language but how many people working in IT companies or manufacturing firms know what the wage subsidy scheme means and what it involves?  It can be very confusing and even more so because of the additional wage supports that were available during Covid.  The promotion of these schemes is key and I know that pre-Covid the Intreo offices did a great job with employer events and information sessions.  There is a role for the Department to make the information more accessible for employers.  There can also be quite a bit of administration involved with forms and so on.  Maybe companies could have a disability champion, one person dedicated to sourcing that type of material.  Maybe we have a role in holding employer conferences to impart this information. <\/p> <p>  Regarding the transition from second level and from third level, it would be great if people leaving school were given an information pack with signposts of where to go next.  Similarly, for third level students, if they have a disability and are going out into the workplace or on to a course, some of them will be very self-conscious of their situation and that can be to the forefront when they are communicating with others.  Sometimes people feel very overwhelmed.  They can feel very stuck after completing their courses and at a loss as to where to go next.  If there was funding available to support people when they finish school or college, through a key worker, a job coach or similar, they would feel more confident making that transition.  If we all had support on our first day at work and for the first few days as we settle in, it would make all of our lives a lot better.  We have all had the sleepless night the night before starting a new job or three or four days after starting when we worry that we have made the worst decision of our lives because we do not know what anyone is talking about.  There are simple solutions out there to help people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, I am lucky to have the support of Ability@Work and to have had its support to set myself up as self-employed.

To give an example, I supported a person in the past who was in need of some assistive technology to be able to do their job.  This person was looking for speech-to-text software but it could not be integrated with the custom-designed software that her department was using.  When there are custom-designed pieces of software being used to support a particular department, integrating something off-the-shelf is not always easy.  When designers are designing custom-built systems for organisations, it would be great if they could think about how other people might need to interact with it and how accessibility features can be included in that.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of grants that organisations and individuals can apply for.  The partial capacity benefit is for people who have been away from work for about six months.  An investigation was done in recent years as to whether that grant could be split into an employment support for those in employment as well as a grant for the cohort of people who cannot continue in employment.  That way, at some point in the future, people who transition into employment might move from the disability allowance and keep their secondary supports like the travel pass and medical card.  I know from working in employability that people want to safeguard those and will restrict their career progression to protect their travel pass or medical card.  If they could transition to other grants such as the partial capacity benefit, and if that could be split into an employment support, they could retain a portion of their grants as well as their medical card and travel pass.  We know from the report on the cost of disability that the cost of disability to individuals is quite significant.  The figures range between &euro;9,000 and &euro;11,000 per person per annum.  That is the context.  That does not even take into account the difficulties people have in trying to access public transport to get to work and all the other issues they might experience in trying to support and maintain their employment.  For future reference, there are grants available but we might need a realignment with regard to how people use and access them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>I thank all the participants for their input today.  It has been an informative and uplifting discussion.  As Senator McGreehan said, at times it has been very concerning too.  That is the harsh reality of the challenges facing people with disabilities and we need to meet those challenges head-on.  We need to overcome them with investment and better recruitment so more people can access more services, as Dr. Brady has so rightly said.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hennessy spoke very passionately about the need for companies to engage in meaningful recruitment campaigns for people with disabilities.  She is dead right.  Mr. Kelly touched on this as well.  When people come in for work placements or internships or anything like that, it should not just be about getting a foot in the door or getting experience.  It should also reward people financially.  We need to move towards a model where people are rewarded for the very valuable work they do in organisations.  Before I was elected as a Deputy two years ago, I worked in a multinational corporation where I was heavily involved in the diversity and inclusion strategy and employer outreach with disability organisations.  We had a very successful partnership with Trinity College centre for people with intellectual disabilities and we hired people who made really valuable contributions to our workforce.  We need to reach out to more companies in the private sector and engage with them proactively to make sure they are aware of the grants that are available to draw down, such as for disability awareness training.  That would allow them to create a truly inclusive and equal culture in which the people they employ are viewed as inclusive and equal.  That is the level we need every private company to get to.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hennessy spoke about the HR barriers and the barriers to information that may be there for HR teams.  We need to break those down.  We need to make it as simple as possible for companies to engage with this in a meaningful way and the first key step is making sure they can access that training grant and know how to access it. <\/p> <p>  Both Ms Hayes and Mr. Kelly spoke about the schemes, investments and grants that are available in the private sector and which have not been properly transported into the public sector.  I just do not understand the rationale for that.  The public sector should be leading on these things.  The fact that assistive technology grants or the wage subsidy scheme are not available in the public sector flummoxes me.  That is something I am happy to raise within my own party of Fine Gael, within the Government and on the floor of the D&aacute;il because these are very simple changes that could make a massive difference to people in accessing employment.  As State entities, we talk about being inclusive employers but there is no point talking that talk unless you are able to walk that walk.  Having these simple structures that are already effectively being used in the private sector is just a no-brainer.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hayes spoke so well about what we need to do to support people in employment.  Mr. Kelly is a model of that and shows how people can become entrepreneurs.  Easy to Read is going to revolutionise restaurants, caf&eacute;s and menus right around the country.  I commend him and all he is doing because he is not just breaking down barriers and having a huge impact but is also showing to potential future entrepreneurs what can be done.  That is hugely important because unless you can see it, it is very hard to be it.  Well done to him on everything he is doing and to Ms Hayes on all the support she and her organisation are giving to entrepreneurs like Mr. Kelly, as well as to companies to make those changes.<\/p> <p>  Ms Finn talked about the importance of disability awareness training in schools, while Ms Hennessy referred to the pressures teachers are already under and how we need to be really careful in how we roll that out.  We also need to roll it out elsewhere.  I have not been offered disability awareness training in my two years here in the Oireachtas.  Maybe that is something we should be looking at rolling out across the Oireachtas.  I know Departments do it and perhaps it is offered here but is only done once every five years or something.  What can we do to increase the uptake on that?  We need an uptick in that in order to effect change.  Perhaps it is offered in increments every couple of years.  Let us look at how to increase that and how to get more people on it.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by what Ms Walsh said about everything we learn being something we did not know before today.  Anything like that makes you richer.<\/p><p>That is the message I have taken from today.  As a committee, we need to spread to organisations we are working with in the public and private sectors and we need to look at that mentality.  The two things we can very quickly tackle head-on are engagement with the private sector on that grant - I would love to hear the representatives' views on how we do that in a very meaningful and proactive way - and how we move those provisions of support and incentives available in the private sector to the public sector.  Hopefully, the political will is there to do that.  Today, we saw there was cross-party support for it and I am certainly determined to see how we can make that happen.  I would love to hear the representatives' thoughts on those two measures in particular because by giving people the opportunity to get into the workforce we are helping them to realise their full potential.  That is what need to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#Q00300","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>We are under some time constraints.

It will be a little longer than one sentence but I will try to keep it as quick as I can.  The focus today has been on employment and further education.  Underpinning all third-level education or third-level employment options is the provision of an appropriate second-level experience.  I do not think we can just jump across that and all of a sudden hope that employment will work out.  There are a couple of aspects to that, which are particularly pertinent in respect of Article 24.  For example, the ongoing review of the senior cycle in post-primary school needs to be urgently accelerated and completed without any further delay.  For example, in some schools transition year, TY, is still not available for all students.  Some schools do not provide a TY course or the leaving certificate applied; they only provide the traditional leaving certificate.  Schools must ensure that all these programmes are provided to all students with special education needs.<\/p> <p>  Another worrying fact came out of a recent survey we conducted of our own members, which is that 75% of those at post-primary school, and young adults, had no career guidance whatsoever.  They had no career guidance training or tuition.  That severely limits post-school options, be those in employment or further education.  Again, disability awareness training is a major factor and teacher training must take that into consideration.  We need to prepare these young people adequately at post-primary level and we must come out of the mindset that attendance at a day service is the only or main option available.  More supports are needed at post-primary level to manage the transition to adulthood, be that into employment or further education.  Unless the supports are in place at post-primary level, we are missing a step and it will be problematic.

There is no better body than the Government to lead this and to offer all its members disability training behind that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021000002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644451200,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>I again thank the committee very much for the opportunity to come along and contribute today.  It has been very informative listening to everybody's different perspectives.  In summary, it has been very enlightening to see where we will go with work in future.  There has been a lot of concentration on the transition into work, how people access work, and employment and the work environment becoming more inclusive, but my point is about retention.  Once students become employees or jobseekers transitioning into the workforce - we have already referenced that 80% of people who have a disability acquire it in the workplace - retention and vocational rehabilitation support should be made readily available.  Strategic priority number 4 in the competitive employment strategy specifically relates to a vocational rehabilitation programme for Ireland.  I would love to see something established.  A pilot was meant to have been established to run a vocational rehabilitation programme.  I would love to see that going forward and to be involved in it.

I am pleased to be accompanied today by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, who has responsibility, as the Chairman outlined, for special education, and by officials from my Department.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with a brief overview of the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2022.  These Estimates set out the approved allocations for the Department that include funding for all of the services normally provided or supported by it.  An allocation is included to meet ongoing costs associated with the safe operation of our schools in a Covid-related environment.  A significant capital allocation is also included. <\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for Vote 26 provides for a net allocation of &euro;8.964 billion representing a gross allocation of &euro;9.283 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of some &euro;0.32 billion, which is an increase of some &euro;322 million on the original 2021 gross expenditure allocations.  This includes &euro;138 million of financial supports for Covid-related measures.  Other such funding will be made available from the Government&rsquo;s central Covid contingency reserve as required during the year, based on the latest public health advice available.  Excluding the Covid-related funding, this represents almost half a billion of an increase in 2022 for permanent expenditure measures. <\/p> <p>  As the committee members will recall, a significant proportion of the funding allocated to Vote 26 will be expended on gross pay and pensions with sums amounting to over &euro;7 billion included in the Vote for these purposes.  This represents some 80% of the expenditure allocation.  Some 96,700 public servants and 44,500 public service pensioners are paid out of these funds.  Other significant expenditure areas include capital infrastructure, school transport, capitation grants to schools and grants to other organisations and agencies. <\/p> <p>  In budget 2022, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I secured a significant allocation for primary, post-primary and special needs education, including important measures such as securing funding for the recruitment of almost 3,200 new teachers and special needs assistants - the largest ever expansion of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity In Schools, DEIS, programme to tackle disadvantage and achieving the historically low 24:1 staffing schedule at primary level. <\/p> <p>  An additional allocation of &euro;18 million was secured for the DEIS programme which will equate to a full year allocation of &euro;32 million.  This will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools and result in an increase of over 20% in funding for the programme.  Continuing to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government, funding will be provided for an additional 350 teachers, which is inclusive of the DEIS staffing improvement, to reduce school staffing schedules by one point for all primary schools.<\/p><p>Continuing to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government, funding will be provided for an additional 350 teachers, which is inclusive of the DEIS staffing improvement, to reduce school staffing schedules by one point for all primary schools.  This Government is continuing to invest in special education.  In 2022, over &euro;2 billion in funding will be provided, representing more than a quarter of the Department&rsquo;s entire current expenditure budget.  Almost 1,200 additional special needs assistant, SNA, posts will be allocated, bringing the total number of SNAs in our schools to over 19,000 in 2022.  This will support the roll-out of the new school inclusion model and will ensure that students with additional needs get the right supports at the right time, as well as supporting the new special class places.  An additional 980 special education teacher posts will be provided.  These will cover both mainstream classes in new and expanding schools and the opening of new special classes.  These investment measures under budget 2022 will be hugely important in tackling disadvantage and supporting children and young people with special educational needs in our education system.  The budget also included a number of other initiatives including once-off funding of &euro;20 million to be provided for books, audio books and other reading materials to increase the literacy tools and supports available to children in our schools.  Additional capitation funding was allocated to voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, to rectify historical inconsistencies in capitation funding at post-primary level.  Additional guidance teacher supports and release days for school leaders will be maintained, while &euro;30 million has been allocated to increase investment in the school transport scheme. <\/p><p> Significant funding has been provided to schools since 2020 to help them address the challenges posed by Covid-19.  This funding sustained school reopenings by providing for the replacement of teachers and non-teaching staff unable to attend for work due to Covid-19, additional release days for principals and deputy principals at primary level, and enhanced cleaning regimes, PPE equipment and well-being supports.  These Revised Estimates continue those supports into 2022 with some &euro;138 million being allocated.  As before, it is available to meet substitution and supervision costs, cleaning costs, sanitiser and PPE.  I am acutely conscious of the impact that Covid-19 has had on our most vulnerable students.  Late last year we announced details of the Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, programme, which is providing additional supports and teaching to those most negatively impacted throughout the pandemic.  This programme commenced last October and will continue into 2022. <\/p><p> I will conclude with reference to the Department&rsquo;s ongoing capital investment programme.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion in capital investment over the period from 2021 to 2025.  This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans to deliver high-quality building projects, with a focus on sustainability for school communities across Ireland.  Capital planning and budgeting is undertaken on a multi-annual basis.  The allocation of &euro;792 million for 2022 will facilitate a continued strong roll-out of school building projects and other measures including the &euro;20 million capital grant for literacy resources to be paid to schools this year, along with funding of &euro;65 million for the approval of 497 projects under the 2022 summer works scheme to improve and upgrade existing school buildings.  <\/p><p> This is just a flavour of the issues that are reflected in these Estimates and I hope I have been of assistance to the committee.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are happy to address any queries members may have.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#A00500","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I am not sure which subhead this would fall into, possibly A10, but possibly A4 as well.  I will start with leaving certificate students.  As the Minister knows, I disagree with the decision she took regarding the approach and many students were disappointed.  My question is focused on budgetary matters.  Students have regularly raised the anxiety, pressure, concerns and uncertainty that have been there.  Will the Department consider a package for increased guidance counsellor support and in particular, a helpline for leaving certificate students, between now and the end of the school year?  My second question relates to Covid-19 funding.  While it is positive that as a society, Covid-19 perhaps poses less of a threat than it has in the past, we cannot pretend that it is not still a huge challenge to schools.  Just today I was speaking to a teacher who advised that out of a staff of 40, there were 12 teachers out, as well as three SNAs, a principal and a vice-principal.  Schools are still under savage pressure.  We still need to tackle issues around filtration and long-term ventilation.  It is remarkable in that context that there is no Covid-19 capital funding this year.  Will the Minister ensure that the Covid-19 funding will continue into 2023?  In particular, will she ensure that the helpline for school leaders is continued and indeed enhanced?<\/p> <p>  The Minister also announced things in the budget that I was very much in agreement with and supportive of, as well as some areas where I thought there was a shortfall.  One that I welcomed was the  investment in DEIS of &euro;18 million, bringing the full year allocation to &euro;32 million.  This was something that I, and others, welcomed.  I have raised with the Ministers that several schools throughout the State, including in my own constituency, the Togher schools and St. Maries of the Isle.  Schools are now at the stage where workforce planning needs to happen.  They need to know soon.  What is the timescale for the roll-out of DEIS?  How many schools are going to benefit?  Will the Minister tell us that?  She will also know that I am keen to inform the criteria to be constructive and if possible I would be grateful for an opportunity to meet with the officials.<\/p> <p>  My final question is under subheads A8 and A10.  School secretaries have been fighting for fairness and equal pay for years.  They are vital to keeping our schools going, particularly during Covid-19.  In October 2020 the T&aacute;naiste committed to the regularising of employment terms and conditions and pension rights of school secretaries.  However, they have been kept in limbo.  Progress is really slow.  They feel let down.  They feel the Department is not listening.  It is very wrong that school secretaries are expected to sign on when school buildings are closed.  It puts them in an insecure position during school holidays.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister will say the matter is before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, but will she tell me whether it is her policy that secretaries should sign on during the summer?  That is what Department officials are arguing.  That is their position at this moment in time.  I do not agree with that and I hope the Minister does not either.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#B00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>On the leaving certificate, while I appreciate the Deputy has a different view from me in terms of the leaving certificate, I want to be very clear that I met, listened to and engaged on a consistent basis with all of the partners in education, including teachers, students, parents and managerial bodies and we worked through each of the requests that were there.  The Deputy will be aware that there were requests, for example, in regard to grade inflation and I have given a strong commitment in terms of the class of 2022 competing with the class of 2021.  It will be kept at the same level in terms of additional accommodations or adjustments being made to papers, which was a very clear request and I have ensured that this is happening.  Students have received that commitment very positively.  As for the accredited grades aspect, I was very clear that we went through every possible permutation of it and we are not in a position to provide it this year similar to providing it last year, as one student in four does not have the necessary data.  To be fair, there was enormous engagement from everybody around the table including from the students themselves.  The students and their leadership have acknowledged the difficulties in regard to that.<\/p> <p>  In regard to guidance counsellors, I am very pleased to say that I am very appreciative of the value and the importance of the work carried out by the guidance counsellors.  I am very pleased to say that in the budget, we made provision that there would be more than 100 additional guidance counsellor posts provided for.  That is something I am hugely committed to going forward. <\/p> <p>  As for the Covid-19 measures in our schools to which the Deputy referred, more than &euro;860 million in Covid-19 measures has been provided for our schools over the period of Covid-19 and in this year, &euro;138 million for 2022 has been put in place.  Again I will be very clear, similar to last year we had a provision in the budget and then, as always, there is the Covid-19 contingency fund.  This year again that Covid-19 contingency fund is available to us.  Subject to public health advice, which we have always followed in our schools, if there is an additional requirement for measures in our schools at any point, they will be put in place.  I am very pleased to say that we continue all of the infection prevention and control measures in our schools at this point, despite the fact that in many other sectors of society they have moved on.  We keep them in place and it is subject to review by 28 February 2022. <\/p> <p>  In regard to DEIS, I acknowledge the Deputy's ongoing interest in DEIS.  There is great interest in the enhancement of the DEIS programme.  Since becoming Minister, I have been extremely supportive of the DEIS programme.  I know the value of it and the benefit it will be to schools when we are in a position to include as many as we possibly can in it.  We have, as the Deputy is aware, a budget of &euro;18 million this year, growing to &euro;32 million next year.  This is a substantial budget which will allow us to maximise the number of schools that for the first time will be included in the DEIS programme.  We are currently finalising the model.  It is my intention that everything will be in place and sufficient advance notice will be given to schools in order that it will be fully implemented by September 2022, the new school year.<\/p><p> I wish to be very clear on school secretaries and caretakers.  That matter is before the WRC.  The Deputy will appreciate that significant progress has been made via the WRC.  Very many people at this meeting, me included, have personal experience of the value and the importance placed on the work of school secretaries and caretakers.

My contribution will be on the same themes.  We are anxious that an assessment be ongoing within the Department of the damage that has been done to the educational experience of children and young people.  Covid is still having a massive effect and influence on children's and young people's day-to-day educational experience.  I would not want the Department to assume that the catch-up fund that has been introduced will be enough.  Clearly, young people are still having difficulty in their young school lives.  They are wearing masks from third class up, as per the public health advice, and at second level.  The windows are open and teachers are continually absent.  Even though that might not be reported on as much as it was in January, it is still a day-to-day reality.  I would like to get a sense from the Minister of the continuing work the Department is doing to assess that damage that is being done, understanding all the while that it is absolutely important that schools remain open and that public health advice is followed.  In that regard, does the Minister have a sense as to when the mask mandate, particularly in primary schools, may be lifted?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in what the Minister had to say about school secretaries.  That matter should absolutely have been resolved by now and the Department should have been much more to the fore in getting it resolved.  I am conscious of the SNAs and their campaign to have the minimum necessary qualifications to become SNAs increased.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about school books.  The Minister will know that I keep raising this issue because progress on it is very much achievable.  Far too many parents in our school communities have discussions about money.  Voluntary contributions are still a real part of school life.  Management bodies say that if voluntary contributions were to be banned, there would be a &euro;45 million hole in the day-to-day running needs of schools.  We could just fill that and not have the need for voluntary contributions.  As a politician, I am now already in the post-Covid restrictions era, getting communications from local schools that are holding fundraisers.  They want support from their local Deputy to take out an advertisement and so on.  I find it pathetic that schools must continually hold fundraisers for their running costs.  It is appalling.  It is ridiculous.  We have to recast our brains totally as to what the normal function of a school is.  Parents' associations are fundraising bodies.  Principals are chasing money all the time.  It is all about fundraising, money, asking parents for book money, etc.  Given all that, I ask about a long-term vision for schools to be self-funded from the Department rather than having to ask parents for money or to have fundraising-type dynamics in school communities.  That is just exhausting.  If parents do not have the money, they feel as if they cannot engage fully in the school community.  If they cannot pay the bills, are they going to go to school fundraiser?  Unlikely.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry; I appreciate that my time is almost up.  My main point is about school books.  Parents in Northern Ireland do not pay for their children's school books.  In fairness, the Minister has rolled out a scheme that benefits approximately 101 schools.  The number went from 52 originally to 101.  Does she have a vision, or is there a vision in her Department, to roll that out to every primary school and secondary school over time?  I believe it would cost &euro;20 million at primary level and &euro;20 million at secondary level.  That could change the whole dynamic such that principals are not chasing after parents for book money, parents are not running around trying to get books and the conversation becomes less about money and more about education.  If they can do it in the North of Ireland, I am pretty sure we could do it here too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#C00600","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>In general, and in response to the Deputy's earlier remarks about Covid supports in our schools, I wish to be very clear that there is provision for &euro;138 million in such supports.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Covid contingency moneys are also available.  I reiterate that we continue the infection prevention and control measures in our schools.  They are operating very well.  I know they have been lifted in other jurisdictions but we are keeping them in place.  If there is a requirement for us to draw further on the Covid contingency fund, we will certainly do so.<\/p> <p>  As for masks, a clear commitment has been given that by 28 February there will be a full review of all the public health measures in our schools, particularly in respect of masks.  It is my understanding that NPHET will meet on 17 February and there will be further work in that regard, but 28 February is the date to which we have committed.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be very clear on the issues the Deputy raised around school books.  I wish to be fair.  I know the Deputy has a particular interest in this and has advocated very strongly on the matter.  We have made available funding of &euro;17.2 million to our schools for the book rental scheme.  More than 98% of our primary schools are availing of that.  As the Deputy correctly stated, 102 schools are availing of the free book pilot scheme.  I am very committed to that.  The context in which we are having this discussion is that everything is a budgetary consideration.  I appreciate that.  I understand the Deputy's bona fides in that the measures he outlines would help to tackle disadvantage and inequality.  We are tackling that ambitiously and in a variety of stages, primarily through DEIS, which was a significant package to resource this year - &euro;18 million rising to &euro;32 million.  As a result, here are a number of strands to how we are facing issues of disadvantage.  Specifically, as I said, considerable funding is already available to the school books rental scheme.  We have rolled out the pilot.  I am interested in advancing that and I will give it my fullest attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#C00700","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of SNA accreditation.

By the end of this year, we will have more than 19,000.  A review of the SNA scheme was carried out by the National Council for Special Education in 2018.  It said we really needed training for SNAs, so we set up a UCD course with places for 3,500 students and SNAs to pursue the course over a period of three years.  There is a ten-month module and they cover a lot of different subjects.  It is important to stress, though, that the calibre of an SNA is not directly affected by the qualifications he or she has.

It has been difficult for them, but they have adapted resiliently and superbly.  Like everybody in wider society, they are looking forward a time where we do not have to enforce these measures.  Everything will be reviewed by 28 February and we will follow what the public health advice is at that time.<\/p> <p>  Regarding substitution, we have been very fortunate that there has been such goodwill from the HEIs and our student teachers have been a remarkable resource to us.

Has the Minister of State's section in the Department been doing a review on the effects on special needs children and what lessons can be learned from that?  At the start of the pandemic in 2020, the special education schools were closed and very few resources were available education-wise or for tuition for children with special educational needs.  Will a full review be carried out specifically concentrating on special education?  We have all learned lessons whereby we do not want to see children who require special education being left the way they were during this pandemic.  If it does hit again in future years, and hopefully it will not, will the Department have had a review done and lessons learned in order that where mistakes were made, they will not be made again? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#E00500","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

The Chairman is quite right that the impact of school closures on children with additional needs was really disastrous.  They were not in a position to learn adequately remotely and they needed it to be in person.  I will outline some of the schemes that we put in place.  We put together the supplementary scheme back at Easter, at a cost of about &euro;10 million.  We expanded the summer provision to double the funding to &euro;40 million, and we also had a huge increase this year for eligibility.  The Ministry, Deputy Foley, also mentioned the Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, programme valued at &euro;52.6 million.  This will help a lot of these children to catch up.  Obviously, there was going to be a clear risk of regression for these children.  I have also announced the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, the EPSEN Act, which is the statutory legislation underpinning all special education.  That legislation is now 17 years old and some parts of that Act have not commenced at all.  We are setting up a steering group and an advisory group and we hope to go to a public consultation very shortly on that to get views in relation to tit so we can, as the Chairman has said, take those learnings from what has occurred over the past two years.  If we have another situation in the future, and please God we will not, then we can make sure that these children with additional needs are catered for.<\/p> <p>  We must bear in mind also that the Government did put the needs of children who had additional needs first and foremost in terms of going back to school, above and beyond anybody else.  The children who have some sort of additional needs only take up about 20% of the entire schoolgoing cohort anyway, so we should not be unable to do that for them in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#E00600","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>I have one further question for the Minister, Deputy Foley, before I go to Deputy Farrell.

This is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow up on a few themes that the Chairman has already started.  I echo the compliments that have been paid to the Minister, Deputy Foley, for the comprehensive work the Department and she have done in relation to a school in Swords.  Last week during D&aacute;il questions, the Chairman touched upon it also, which is the fulfilment of and renewal of the capital plan, and the impacts this will have on communities, especially growing communities.  There are acute pressures, as I am sure the Minister will understand, in my constituency which is one of the fastest growing in the country.  On that basis, I recall that in 2008 a total of 80 children showed up to school with their bags, books and uniforms, but there were no school places.  Thankfully, the Department was able to resolve that issue fairly quickly, but it took six weeks for temporary accommodation to be delivered.<\/p><p>I do not believe that any of us wants to go back to that scenario.<\/p><p> The expanded brief of the Department in terms of liaising with other bodies such as local authorities and the Department of Social Protection, among others, is essential if we are to keep on top of the demands.  There are acute pressures throughout the country but I can speak only for my constituency, particularly Malahide, Portmarnock, Swords and Balbriggan.  In other communities, steps are being taken to ensure there is capacity available.  The renewed capital plan, which sets out the ambition of the Minister for Education and her Department, is very important, as is the opportunity for the committee to go through it.  Will the Minister provide further information on the advancement of the next capital programme?<\/p><p> The other issues I wish to raise relate to the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, in particular the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which I welcome.  The committee has discussed the review a number of times.  It is incredibly important that we complete that work.  As far as I am concerned, the biggest issue we have all had in this area over the years has been that parts of the EPSEN Act were never commenced.  Is the Minister proposing to engage with the NGOs and various groups that are key to the delivery of services for children with different additional educational needs?<\/p><p> On the recruitment of further special needs assistants, we have an ongoing commitment to increase the number of SNAs year on year.  All Members of the House welcome that position because it is entirely necessary.  Will that commitment continue?  Will there be a review within the Department of the SNA allocation model given that it is two years old now to ensure it is operating as desired and designed?  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#E01500","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Farrell for his interest in special education, on which he speaks to me regularly.  I am not sure if the Deputy was in attendance when I mentioned the EPSEN Act earlier.  I have launched a review of the Act, which is not before time as it is 17 years since the Act was first published in 2004.  Parts of the Act were never commenced and there were good reasons for that at the time.  One was related to funding.  I believe commencement of each section of the Act was costed at &euro;225 million or thereabouts.  However, the Act did put the National Council for Special Education on a statutory footing, which was a good thing, and provided for the membership of the NCSE.  We now have increased investment to &euro;2 billion, which was not available at that time.<\/p> <p>  We have also changed our approach, moving from a diagnosis-led approach to a more needs-based approach.  That must be taken into account.  The current process involves setting up the steering group, which will include representatives of the Department, advocacy groups and the National Council for Special Education.  I also have an advisory group, which is more of a fit for advocacy groups and NGOs.  We want to hear from everybody through the consultation we will have after that.  We expect the consultation to take around three months.  I do not want it to be open-ended because it might never be completed otherwise.  The bottom line for me and, I am sure, the Minister, Deputy Foley, is to ensure we implement the Act in full and that it is reflective of the views of children with additional needs and what they fight for and face, bearing in mind that it should be streamlined with the approach of the Department.<\/p> <p>  We have an additional 1,165 SNAs available from January of this year.  That SNA reallocation will take place.  The Deputy is correct that it has been two years and it was stopped as a result of Covid.  We are hoping to focus on schools for which the SNA allocation was frozen during that period and which may have been disadvantaged.  We are aware of that and the National Council for Special Education is working very closely with schools on exceptional reviews and all of those matters through the SENOs.  As I said earlier, we will have more than 19,000 SNAs by the end of this year.  It is imperative that schools have an adequate facility.

The Department is entirely committed to resourcing well-being initiatives and to supporting schools.  From primary level and right into secondary level, schools have been rolling out these types of initiatives for healthy eating plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#G00100","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#G00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>I have a few brief questions for the Minister and Minister of State.  One for the Minister relates, perhaps tangentially, to the subject of health and obesity.  Most secondary schools will now have a hall, but a fair proportion still do not.  As matters stand with capital funding, unless there is a new build or refurbishment that is effectively tantamount to a new build, schools are not getting approval for halls.  We must address this in the capital programmes.  In accordance with the Healthy Ireland targets and the desire to offer physical education, PE, to every school as a leaving certificate subject, schools need halls.  I can think of examples of school in my area, and elsewhere, that do not have school halls and have no prospect of getting them.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Minister of State, one of the elements of the budget which I welcomed was the numbers in respect of SNAs.  The last two budgets have shown that having targets in place does not necessarily mean they are realised.  We do not seem to be able to recruit the same number of staff as the funds have been allocated for.  It is not just a budgetary issue.  Part of it comes back to the recognition of qualifications aspect.  I disagree with the response that this issue will be part of the public sector pay talks.  A review should be undertaken before that happens.  It is putting the cart before the horse otherwise.  We cannot decide what people should be paid unless we have a sense of exactly what their responsibilities are going to be.  My request to the Minister of State, and I do not think this is unreasonable, is that she establish an expert group to look at the qualifications and criteria for SNAs.  The order in which this should proceed is to undertake an expert review before moving to pay negotiations.  We must first know what we are asking SNAs to do and what qualifications they should be expected to have to qualify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#G00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>That training for the SNAs is taking place now.

I am conscious that I have only five minutes to deliver my opening statement.  I will, therefore, give a very brief overview of the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2022.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for Vote 45 that is before the committee now provides for a net allocation of &euro;2.9 billion, representing a gross allocation of &euro;3 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of &euro;76 million.  When taken with the National Training Fund expenditure of &euro;765 million, the gross allocation for our Department in 2022 increases to &euro;3.7 billion.<\/p> <p>  The Vote 45 allocation comprises the following key elements: a core allocation of more than &euro;2.9 billion to meet the various requirements of the Department in the areas of further and higher education, research innovation and science; temporary Covid funding of &euro;20 million at budget 2021 to fund increased demand for Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants in the face of the ongoing pandemic; temporary funding of &euro;19 million to support education and training reform for new and future technological universities under Ireland&rsquo;s national recovery and resilience plan; and temporary funding of &euro;3.5 million through the Brexit Adjustment Reserve to address the impact of Brexit on the Erasmus scheme.  The Department&rsquo;s capital ceiling has also increased and funding was provided to meet the costs associated with the public sector Building Momentum pay deal.<\/p> <p>  Some 47% of the Department&rsquo;s gross Vote is allocated to pay and pensions, reflecting the crucial work public servants are carrying out in the further and higher education system and in the research, innovation and science sector.  This Department provides the funding for more than 26,000 public servants and 11,000 public service pensioners.<\/p> <p>  Excluding temporary adjustments and funding, the core increase year-on-year for my Department&rsquo;s Vote is 8%, or &euro;204 million.  This increased from additional funding received during budget 2022, allowing this Department to progress major priorities.  <\/p> <p>  First, we are making a significant investment in the higher education sector, including funding for increased undergraduate places to support leaving certificate students and meet Ireland&rsquo;s demographic needs.  In 2022, funding for the higher education sector increases to &euro;2.1 billion, the highest it has ever been, and higher even than peak funding levels in 2008.  This is only a start and my Department will be publishing the consultant report under the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support, DG REFORM, programme on sustainable future funding of the tertiary system later this year.<\/p> <p>  Second, recognising that the levels of support for students are out of step with the costs of going to college, this Department increased student supports in order to address increased cost of living.  The SUSI review will make key recommendations on how to improve the SUSI grant scheme and this report will be brought to Government alongside the future funding report shortly.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the impact of the pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we all live and work.  Industries are crying out for staff, including digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, construction, transport, logistics, climate sustainability and many more.  In 2022, we have significantly invested in upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeship in order to help address the significant workplace change associated with digitalisation, automation and climate change, whose impacts are expected to increase in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  I trust and hope that this overview is of assistance to the committee.

Consent classes and arrangements at third level are extremely important.  They must be rolled out uniformly across all third level campuses.  What supports are being provided by the Department to achieve this?  Interrelated, bearing in mind non-academic activity on campuses, how much has the Department invested in mental health supports on our campuses?  These are critical services that third level institutions should provide, with the support of the Department.  Could the Minister of State comment on those two points?

Both issues are important.  The Department takes them very seriously.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has really led in these areas.  In 2021, &euro;5 million was allocated to our higher education institutions to support student mental health and well-being.  That builds on the &euro;5 million provided in the previous year to enhance the capacity of the support structures available.  We were particularly mindful of the fact that we wanted to help people in a more one-to-one setting, so in this regard the money went towards hiring additional capacity and providing people with more contact time and support hours.<\/p> <p>  On consent, sexual violence and harassment, the framework for consent in higher education institutions was launched in 2019.  Its aim is to ensure the creation of a campus culture that is safe, respectful and supportive.  To assist institutions in implementing the framework, funding of over &euro;400,000 was allocated by our Department to a number of initiatives since the launch.  In addition, the Higher Education Authority has allocated funding of over &euro;500,000 to consent workshops for the development of what is called Speak Out, an anonymous reporting and support tool.  Significant resources and funding have been made available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#K00600","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>I appreciate that very much.

That is only a good thing, as far as I am concerned.  If we are not moving on, there is an onus on the Department to examine the funding stream and determine what else can be done to support safety on campus and the ambition set out in the programme, which, of course, I welcome.  I do not really need a response on this matter but request that the Department consider it seriously in the context of future budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#K00700","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>We are open to considering these matters.

It is a long time ago.  I recognise the steps the Department has taken to support students, particularly over Covid, during which technological supports have been offered.  That is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  My two other questions relate to parliamentary questions I submitted this week.  They are specific to critical skills.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, answered the questions.  I was not aware that the Minister would not be present today so I apologise if I am putting the Minister of State on the spot.  The critical skills in education right now, beyond those of teachers and special needs assistants, entail offering additional supports to children with additional needs, including occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and clinical psychological services.  The response I received from the Department this week was that there are 244 places available per annum for those three areas on an ongoing basis.  There is a chronic shortage, particularly at clinical psychology and occupational therapy levels.  To my mind, these involve critical skills.<\/p> <p>  I was talking to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, before and during the meeting this afternoon on the supports the State provides to children with additional needs.<\/p><p>If ever there was a critical skills shortage, it is in the number of places that are available across the State for those areas.  I cannot think of a school that has not been in touch with me in my 18 years of public life that does not have one of those critical skills deficiencies, either at a school or community level.  To put it mildly, the waiting lists are very difficult.  When put in the context of a child with additional needs, it is almost impossible outside of the school sphere for parents to get access to supports they desperately need in a timely way.  I understand that the CAO is a separate entity and that the HEA sets up these courses.  I recognise that some of the courses are at doctoral level, as the Minister of State indicated in response to my questions on Tuesday.  I totally understand that, but the Department has a role to play in ensuring we can meet the critical skills deficiency in that area.<\/p><p> The other part of the question relates to a topical issue in the further and higher education area, which is retrofitting and the skills required in that regard.  The Government has put in place an &euro;8 billion nine-year programme, which I am sure will be added to over the years and will most likely continue past 2030.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has stated the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science plays a key role in ensuring that places are provided.  It was indicated to me that courses range from a few hours to a few weeks, while others are for a few months.  They will provide people with the skills to allow us to deliver on our climate commitments.  Does the Minister of State have a comment in that regard?  I have one final question after his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022021000002#K01100","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>As Deputy Farrell stated, the provision of trained workers is crucial to rolling out the retrofitting campaign.

There are two centres of excellence and, currently, two education and training boards provide training.  All the other ETBs are working now to scale up to a point where they can provide this training.

I apologise if I have gone on a little too long.  My final question is one I have asked before but to which I have not had a response thus far.  I appreciate that it is possibly an unusual question.  The modified leaving certificate of the past two years has had significant consequences for third level and a significant amount of funding had to be provided to meet extra demand for courses.  In the past in an average year, the Department would have known the number of students dropping out in first year as a consequence of making the exact mistake I made in 1995 when I selected the wrong course.  I subsequently found the right course and went from there.  The dropout rate is measurable.  There is a significant amount to be learned from the dropout rate and an analysis of the reasons behind it.  The past two years of accredited grades put an awful lot of students into third level who, in other circumstances, might not have been so fortunate.  I would like to either prove or disprove that statement and the only analysis apart from the grades at third level is the dropout rate.  Such analysis would be helpful, especially in the context of the root and branch reform of senior cycle and the leaving certificate the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, is doing at secondary level.  To be fair to him, the Chairman has probably held more than 20 hours of committee hearings in the public eye, not to mention the dozens of hours of work that are done out of view of the public.  That analysis would feed into the leaving certificate reform.

I know technological universities can borrow for accommodation but, other than that, they are prohibited from doing so.  We have visited Cork and Limerick, the Minister of State's own constituency, and absolutely fantastic work is being done.  This is an issue that consistently came up when speaking to people in the institutes there and in speaking to the presidents of other technological universities.

I give the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and their Department full credit for increasing the number of apprenticeships and making them more appealing to an awful lot of students.  In the past, there were students who felt looked down on for doing apprenticeships.  That has totally changed.  The Department has done a great amount of work on that.

There has been an application in for some time with regard to delivering training and apprenticeships in a centre in the town where programmes have been delivered.

I ask the Minister of State to look at that application.  I will wait until tomorrow to see the criteria being used for this.  I ask the Minister of State to take the whole town and the make-up of the population into consideration because delivering apprenticeships within the community so that people do not have to travel can result in many positive externalities that can feed into the whole of the community, helping those who are working very hard to ensure the community is vibrant.  The bank in Ballyhaunis has been taken away.  It had a Bank of Ireland branch and another bank but there is no bank there now.  One of the best ways to ensure the town is sustainable and viable and to increase the human capital within it is to provide for apprenticeships and training in order that people can find work of the very same kind they would be doing in those apprenticeships in the area and meet the skills demands there.

The committee has had the opportunity to look through the regulations.  I invite the Minister to address the committee and we will then move to questions and answers.  It is quite a short meeting, so I remind members to be direct with their questions, if possible, and the Minister to be direct with his answers.  That would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021000002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to discuss with the committee the Planning and Development Act (Exempted Development) Regulations 2022.  There are certain specific items to address within the regulations.  The proposed regulations amend provisions in the principal planning and development regulations 2001-21 relating to development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each House of the Oireachtas is required to approve draft planning regulations relating to exempted development by way of a positive resolution before they can be signed into law by me, as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That is why it is important that consideration by the committee today of these draft changes to regulations is part of that approval process.  I appreciate the time afforded to the matter by the committee.<\/p> <p>  The Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2018 came into operation in February 2018 and were introduced under the previous Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland plan.  They provided for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of a change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground-floor premises, to residential use.  I will go into a little detail on this.  The measure has facilitated the productive reuse of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and bringing on stream increased housing supply.  We want that to improve further.  I want to extend those regulations out.<\/p> <p>  I know the committee has done a significant amount of work on and the Government is serious about tackling the scourge that is vacancy.  I have visited many areas across the country, including many regional towns, cities and villages.  I recently visited Waterford with Senator Cummins, where I saw some of the excellent work being done there to bring vacant properties back into use.  As part of that, we want to see what other vacant properties we can bring back that we can exempt from seeking permission.  An obvious category of such properties is that of vacant public houses.  That was clear after my trip to Waterford with Senator Cummins, as well as my trips to Limerick and other locations.  Unfortunately, there will be more vacant public houses.  Many public houses are prominent buildings in towns, villages and cities across the country.  To me, it makes eminent sense that those public houses will fall under these exemptions.  That is what I am proposing fundamentally to the committee.<\/p> <p>  One aspect is to extend the current exemptions out to 2025 and to add to those exemptions the use of vacant public houses under the existing criteria.  That will mean planning permission will not be required to convert those units into residential units.  In fairness, all members of the committee, of all different political backgrounds, have regularly and rightly highlighted the issue of above-shop use of vacant premises.  There is more work to be done post these regulations, but it is interesting to see the impact of the existing regulations brought in by the previous Government.  The take-up year on year is increasing.  In 2021, the most recent full year, there were 283 notifications.  Although one does not have to receive planning permission, one does have to notify the local authority within two weeks of commencing the work.  There were 283 notifications, which will bring in 676 new residential units.  That is not something to be sniffed at, in my view.  It is really good use of empty space and vacant properties.  In total, since the regulations came into operation in 2018, 1,400 residential units have been brought in.  Frankly, I think we can do a lot better.  More people need to know about these exemptions.<\/p> <p>  As regards public houses, there is a real opportunity.  There will be a couple of conditions around that.  It is effectively introducing a new class into these regulations.  I thank Senator Cummins for his input into and intervention on this.  We are not seeking to maintain a restriction of 250 sq. m.  I know the Senator met with officials on that issue.  Such a restriction might be too onerous in the context of what is the licence piece and what is the non-licence piece and that creates a whole complication within it.  My clear view - this is a slight amendment to the written statement provided to members - is that we should leave the 250 sq. m restriction aside.  I am not proposing to have that 250 sq. m restriction.  What I am doing, however, and it is important for larger premises, is ensuring we will maintain the current level of nine residential units.  The reason for that is that there are some, though not many, vacant superpubs.  It makes sense to me that planning would be sought through a local authority for bigger developments such as that.  We will maintain the current maximum of nine residential units in any such structure.<\/p> <p>  We will extend the exemptions right the way through to 2025.  We will bring in the new class, which is public houses, and we will continue to keep this under review.  Members can see there has been an increase year on year.  There is capacity to do a lot more.  I and the Government will be bringing forward other measures, such as in respect of town and village renewal, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund and grants that will be available but in the medium term it is sensible for these measures to continue and to actually change them in the context of public houses as that can make a significant difference.  We will continue to keep this under review.<\/p> <p>  If the committee endorses what we wish to do, I hope to bring the draft regulations before the D&aacute;il and the Seanad next week to get them approved.  We could have them in place by the end of next week.  Obviously, we are letting all local authorities and relevant people know.  This is a significant step forward.  I have digressed from the statement that was provided to the committee.  I am sure all members have had an opportunity to read it in detail.  The main change relates to the setting aside of the 250 sq. m restriction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021000002#A00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>All of us welcome these measures.

I have two specific questions.  Will the Minister remind the committee what, if any, other planning requirements are in place?  While an application for change of use is no longer required, what else is required?  The reason I ask this is because previously the Minister and I, as well as others, called for a one-stop shop to make all the other planning requirements easier.  I ask him to remind us of those requirements.<\/p> <p>  Will he give us more detail on the implications and the rationale for the removal of the 250 sq. m restriction?  I am not against it, but it would be helpful to know for the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021000002#B00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>I remind members that some limitations remain which, I believe, are sensible.  They include a requirement that the property must be vacant for at least two years prior to the commencement of the work.  We do not want people closing premises and then saying they will convert them.  There are requirements for adherence to the minimum requirements of floor area, as well as storage space requirements and the need for adequate natural light and habitable rooms.  There is a good reason for those, which are that we want good quality apartments and homes.  It is right it would follow the current standards.  There is a maximum of nine residential units, which I have explained.  That is consistent with the current exemption and is the reason I kept it at nine.  If we are getting into bigger developments than that, which may impact upon adjacent premises or residential areas, it is more appropriate they would go to planning.  Obviously, the relevant controls must be adhered to in regard to protected structures and the external fabric of the building.  The other item is that the conversion must comply with all building control requirements, including fire safety, and be structurally sound.<\/p> <p>  On the 250 sq. m issue, this size area would cover most average vacant pubs throughout the country.  A vacant building where above the shop is vacant would be exempt anyway, but what we were seeking to do within the regulations was to ensure a person would have to designate that the former licensed piece was under 250 sq. m.  Senator Cummins, in his discussions with officials in the Department, both gentlemen who are here with me, outlined a number of specific examples where that requirement would make it too onerous and very difficult to be able to define between one and the other.  In the overall scheme of things, we are looking at a small proportion and we have some data from the survey we carried out with local authorities on the average size of pubs, which was 226 sq. m and was therefore under 250 sq. m.  That is the reason for the removal of the restriction.  It is for ease of implementing these changes.  I hope that answers the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021000002#B00700","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>I might want to ask about town centres and how it will help with rural villages.  On the regulations, I hear what the Minister is saying about the removal of the 250 sq. m restriction.  My fear was that by having the limit and the number of units, we might end up going for smaller units of lower quality while those making the conversion might want to have larger units.  There is a benefit in the 250 sq. m restriction removal and I welcome that.  I had not been aware of the reason before the Minister just explained it.<\/p> <p>  My concerns are around reassuring people about exemptions.  It is tricky to say to people they can have an exemption but we will still have some control.  I want to talk about that.  Of the external structure, 50% needs to be retained.  Am I right in saying most people will not see additional height with this and there will not be additional changes?  We are not talking about adding huge boxes on to an existing building and all that.  The second issue is how it would fit into the existing streetscape.  Will the Minister flesh out how that would work?  Third, how would it relate to the development plan?  Many councillors have contacted me and said they put a lot of time and energy into a development plan within which there are requirements.

To address one of them, first, let us remember what we are focusing on.  We are focusing on commercial units that have been vacant for two or more years, and we are adding public houses to those.  Many of these will be on our main streets in towns and urban areas, but they will be in rural areas too.  The exemption applies across the board.<\/p> <p>  The fabric of the building must be maintained.  The idea of altering the facade or adding to the front would not be allowed.  The fabric of the building has to be maintained.  Any conservation measures, street lines and such issues would all have to be maintained.  There is also a requirement that notification be given to the planning authority two weeks prior to the commencement of any works.  In the Deputy's area of Finglas or in Santry, Dublin City Council would have to be contacted before the work commences.  There is no fear, which residents might have, of major changes to the footprint of these areas.<\/p> <p>  What is very positive about this is that we are going be able to try to get people and families back living in these areas.  I have seen it happen in a number of towns and villages, such Fermoy, Waterford, Limerick and Clonmel.  There has been some success around this.  The take-up heretofore has not been bad.  We are looking at 1,400 residential units being provided in what were empty and unused spaces.  I believe we can do a lot better than that.  This change will help.  We will have to keep these measures under review because I want the figure to increase substantially year on year.

It shows the system can and does work.  The Minister needs to be acknowledged for taking on board the suggestions.

I call the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#A00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1221,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members.  I submitted a longer and more detailed written statement, which the members have already, so I will keep my remarks relatively short and present an overview.  I also appreciate the Chair's kind remarks regarding the briefing provided by departmental officials to members.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2022, as well as the Votes for the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority, which are also under the aegis of my Department.  As the Chair mentioned, I am joined by my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for local government and planning, Deputy Peter Burke.  I am also joined by my officials, Mary Hurley, assistant secretary, local government division; David Kelly, principal officer, social housing delivery division; David Flynn, principal adviser, water division; Lorraine O'Donoghue, principal officer, local government finance unit; and Janet Jacobs, assistant principal officer, departmental finance unit.<\/p> <p>  Starting with Vote 34, this totals over &euro;5.9 billion for the year and comprises &euro;2.5 billion in current funding and &euro;3.4 billion on the capital side.  In addition, there is a &euro;276 million capital carry-over from 2021.  Another &euro;91.5 million is coming from the proceeds of the local property tax, LPT.  This means that &euro;6.3 billion in funds will be managed across Vote 34 this year.  As we continued to grapple with the ever-changing reality of the impact of Covid-19 last year, our ability to push forward at the pace of delivery anticipated was simply not possible.<\/p><p>Construction closures, social distancing measures, workforce impacts and supply chain issues outside of any of our control or visibility had a significant impact on delivery and, consequentially, had an impact on expenditure.<\/p><p> My Department continued to work at a relentless pace to deliver emergency legislation, to ensure that vulnerable households were protected and to push on to provide a new pathway for housing delivery at a scale and investment level never seen before in the history of this State.  The past few weeks have been very positive in terms of the cautious reopening and I am very hopeful that will translate now into an unimpeded and very productive year.<\/p><p> More than &euro;3.6 billion is being allocated to housing programmes in 2022, representing an increase of more than &euro;527 million or 17% on the Estimate for 2021.  In addition, there will be &euro;92 million from local property tax receipts and a carry-over of &euro;246 million from 2021.  The total funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes is just under &euro;4 billion, including &euro;2.6 billion in capital funding.  This will be further supplemented again through Housing for All, HFA, lending and Land Development Agency funding for the most substantial capital budget for housing ever seen.<\/p><p> Bearing in mind that there are many types of social housing needs with this budget, we must take a multipronged approach and maintain the support for the 82,000 households in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP, or in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  We cannot simply turn off the tap in that space.  We must ensure immediate supports being made available for families who seek urgent assistance in providing funding for an additional 15,000 immediate supports for 2022.  Focus will be on long-term housing delivery, with the delivery of 11,820 new social homes, 9,000 of which will be new-build social homes.  As part of our Housing for All programme, we intend to get that average of new-build homes up to 10,000 over the period of the plan.<\/p><p> The Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever stand-alone affordable housing legislation, established the basis for our delivery of new affordable purchase and cost-rental schemes.  We have targeted 4,100 affordable homes this year to be delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and through a strategic partnership between the State and banks.  The first cost-rental homes in the country were tenanted in 2021 in Taylor Hill, Balbriggan, at an average of 40% below market value.  The first affordable purchase homes will be made available in Boherboy in Cork city at purchase prices ranging from &euro;217,000 for a two-bedroom home to &euro;243,000 for a three-bedroom home.  We will now see a really significant year-on-year increase in the number of affordable homes which will lead to an average of 6,000 homes per year over the lifetime of Housing for All.<\/p><p> While it is clear and strategic to have our focus on the long term and on building our housing stock, we must also invest energy and funding into tackling homelessness, which is a real, immediate and acute issue.  Those in homelessness are living at the sharpest end of this housing crisis.  The &euro;194 million allocated in 2022 reflects the priority the Government is giving to this area and will advance 18 distinct commitments under Housing for All.  I will also provide funding for other important areas, including &euro;85 million to retrofit 2,400 social housing homes; enhancing measures to tackle vacancy and providing support to the rental sector.<\/p><p> Recognising that funding alone will not yield results, a central element of Housing for All is to build institutional capacity.  I am committed to strengthening the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects and to engage in the range of activities to promote living cities and towns, by tackling vacancy and dereliction and supporting regeneration.<\/p><p> My Department has made substantial progress on how we manage our water quality and water services.  Central to this is the transformation and separation of Irish Water from the Ervia group and the creation of a national, publicly-owned, regulated, single public water utility.  There is a major programme of work ahead of us to complete this transformational journey and engagement on a framework for the future is currently taking place at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I believe it will be possible to reach a collective agreement that addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.<\/p><p> In 2022, the Department will provide more than &euro;1.4 billion to Irish Water.  This includes &euro;830 million in capital to allow it to continue its capital investment programme to modernise and expand the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s water infrastructure through projects such as Ringsend, Arklow and Kilkenny wastewater treatment plants, which will raise network capacity, increase water quality and bring us closer to compliance with European directives.  It is important to say it is the first time Irish Water has a view of its funding on a multi-annual basis and can plan appropriately to deliver projects such as Ringsend, which is now commissioned and Arklow, where we have broken ground and contractors are in place and throughout the country.<\/p><p> The record level of investment will ensure that Irish Water can support the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s housing objectives in Housing for All.  In addition, Irish Water is taking additional actions to support housing connections to public water services through publishing capacity registers, which are available now, engaging with the LDA on identifying land suitable for development and facilitating self-lay accreditation, which is an important step forward.  We initiated a pilot scheme in July 2020 to allow for self-lay accreditation and it is now expanding throughout the country.<\/p><p> My Department also continues to invest directly in rural water services through the rural water programme by allocating more than &euro;62 million in 2022.  It will launch a new multi-annual rural water programme later this year.  This will also include a new element to support the provision of wastewater treatment in non-sewered villages.  This will be a very important announcement shortly.  We will manage this programme with the co-operation of local authorities and Irish Water.  I will have additional announcements on that in the coming weeks and months.<\/p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will shortly speak on matters related to local government but I would like to specifically mention the significant capital investment in fire and emergency services in 2022.  The allocation will amount to &euro;19.3 million, including investment in the national directorate for fire and emergency management, NDFEM, and &euro;18 million in capital.  Some &euro;6 million is allocated for the progression of fire station construction and upgrade projects.  The projects announced under the 2021 to 2025 fire services capital programme are progressing.  Further drawdown is expected in 2022, as more projects progress through the design and planning stages, with construction beginning on others.<\/p><p> Some &euro;5 million will contribute to appliances, procured under the new fire appliance procurement programme, which runs from 2021 to 2023.  Some &euro;2 million will progress the final element of the upgrade of the communications and mobilisation system under the Ctr&iacute; project.  Some &euro;5 million will fund other necessary emergency and rescue vehicles and equipment, including jeeps, vans, road-traffic accident equipment, breathing apparatus, telecommunications and other fire equipment, where grant aid has been approved to fire authorities.<\/p><p> On the heritage side, in 2022, a total of &euro;180 million is allocated for heritage projects, of which &euro;176 million is Revised Estimates Volume, REV, funding, with a further &euro;3.5 million carbon tax carry-over for peatlands restoration.  Operational and capital budgets will increase almost 45% year on year in 2022. This will fund activity under the National Monuments Service, the built heritage programmes and the National Parks and Wildlife Service's extraordinary teams that deliver for the citizen directly through the agencies and bodies under our aegis, which are the Heritage Council, Waterways Ireland and the Irish Heritage Trust.<\/p><p> This substantial funding will allow the Department to progress an expanded programme of peatlands restoration; biodiversity investment and nature conservation works.  We will expand participation in the National Parks and Wildlife Service farm plan scheme and the LIFE nature programmes.  We will protect our archaeological and built heritage with a further 1,100 built heritage projects targeted for support in 2022.<\/p><p>We will invest in and support Ireland's national parks and reserves.  Approved staffing levels for the NPWS now exceed those in place prior to the financial crisis.  We will maintain and invest in our inland waterways for some 15,000 registered boat users through Waterways Ireland, including the acceleration of the Ulster Canal and other cross-Border projects.<\/p><p> The 87,000 ha national parks and nature reserve network and the heritage estate of national monuments and historical properties saw unprecedented levels of visitors over the last two years, offering a lifeline by providing physical and mental health space where people could safely access the outdoors for fresh air, exercise, mindfulness and well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic.    <\/p><p> To summarise, the 2022 funding continues the supports for heritage and associated grant schemes providing conservation, amenity, health and well-being benefits to our citizens along with jobs, as well as supporting Ireland's climate actions, tourism and economic development in communities and regions.  All this work on heritage is being ably led and managed by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is doing a fantastic job.  He cannot attend this meeting due to other commitments this evening.<\/p><p> This year, some &euro;43 million will be provided to Met &Eacute;ireann and will be used to fund the essential maintenance, development and support of Met &Eacute;ireann's specialised meteorological and ICT infrastructure.  In the context of climate change and the impact of weather in Ireland, Met &Eacute;ireann serves society through the production and communication of reliable weather and climate information that will protect life and property.  This funding will further enhance Met &Eacute;ireann's role as the authoritative voice of meteorology and climatology in Ireland.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, my Department also has responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority.  A provision of nearly &euro;19.6 million is made in Vote 34 for Ordnance Survey Ireland in 2022, while the other two organisations have separate Votes, amounting to &euro;22 million for the Valuation Office and &euro;35 million for the Property Registration Authority.  These bodies are to merge to form Tailte &Eacute;ireann and work is proceeding in my Department on this important project.<\/p><p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible given we are covering a Department as broad as the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with such a significant investment programme for 2022.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will now speak about the important work being funded in local government and planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#A00600","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Estimate for 2022 in planning and local government.  I also have responsibility for Traveller accommodation and support and housing for people with disabilities and older people.  As the Minister noted, significant capital and current funding has been provided to the Department in 2022 and we are all firmly focused on ensuring the maximum output from this State investment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Traveller accommodation and supports, it is important to note that some &euro;15.5 million in capital funding was fully drawn down by local authorities in 2021.  A total of &euro;1.33 million was also provided to local authorities for Covid-related measures such as the provision of additional accommodation, halting site cleaning, additional sanitation and isolation units.  There will be some Covid-related expenditure in 2022.  Our objective is to ensure that services provided to halting sites will be maintained.  To that end, funding will be provided for any additional services deemed necessary by local authorities.  Overall, some &euro;18 million is being provided in capital funding for 2022 representing a 16% increase over 2021.  In addition, some &euro;6.5 million in current funding will be provided in 2022 bringing the total funding to &euro;24.5 million.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware of the recommendations of the expert group on Traveller accommodation.  The programme board overseeing the implementation of these recommendations met on six occasions last year and the board has agreed to report progress on the recommendations on the Department website.  This will be available shortly.<\/p> <p>  Turning to housing for people with a disability and older people, over &euro;2.7 million will be provided under subhead A14 in 2022.  The review of the national housing strategy for people with a disability was completed in 2021.  The implementation group for housing options for our ageing population joint policy statement also completed its work in 2021.  Work on a number of key actions will continue into 2022.  The Housing Agency is working with local authorities to ensure their strategic plans for housing for people with disabilities are updated and implemented.  The mental health tenancy sustainment project, which is jointly funded by the Department and the Department of Health, is continuing and will be expanded in 2022.<\/p> <p>  Funding for the Age-Friendly Ireland shared services supporting the implementation of the actions set out in the Housing Options for Our Ageing Population policy statement will also continue in 2022.  Complementing this strategic work is subhead A18, which makes funding provision for the payment to local authorities of expenditure incurred on the suite of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability.  Three separate schemes are available.  The housing adaptation grant for people disability scheme provides grants of up to &euro;30,000 to assist people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried.  The housing aid for older people scheme provides grants of up to &euro;8,000 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out.  The mobility aids grant scheme is available to fast-track grants of up to &euro;6,000 to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household.  Some &euro;65 million is being made available in 2022 to deliver on these schemes.  <\/p> <p>  The Local Government Fund's primary purpose is to channel local property tax to local authorities following collection by the Revenue Commissioners as well as certain local authority initiatives.  This programme includes a contribution to the Local Government Fund of &euro;225 million in 2022 to support the local government sector in providing a range of essential services at local level, including assistance towards increased pay and pensions, costs arising under national pay agreements, local property tax equalisation payments and important local government initiatives across the country, including supporting shared services.  In 2022, income sources to the Local Government Fund are estimated to be local property tax of &euro;520 million as well as a payment from the Vote of some &euro;225 million.  The payment from the Vote includes the Exchequer contribution of local property tax equalisation of &euro;34.3 million.  The total local property tax allocation for 2022 is just under &euro;524 million, which includes the impact of all local variation decisions.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two years, the Department has worked closely with local authorities to provide an essential lifeline to local businesses in the form of a rates waiver.  By the end of 2021, more than &euro;1.1 billion had been routed through the Local Government Fund for this purpose, with an additional &euro;62.3 million that will issue in respect of quarter 4 of last year.  It was recently announced that the targeted rates waiver for quarter 4 would be extended to quarter 1 of 2022.  However, this does not form part of today's Estimate and Covid-19 supports for 2022 will be kept under review.  Further supports are not currently anticipated.<\/p> <p>  A significant number of activities are under way or in planning.  A few key programmes merit mention.  The largest area of planned expenditure is the urban regeneration and development fund, for which a total of &euro;159 million is being provided this year, including a &euro;25 million capital carryover from 2021.  The immediate focus is on ensuring early progress on the programme of 132 transformative regeneration and development projects and the Department is in regular contact with local authorities to assist their advancement.  The next call for proposals under the urban regeneration and development fund will be arranged later.  The focus of the call will reflect the experience of the funding calls to date, the objectives of Housing for All and tackling vacancy in towns, which is reflected in our town centre first approach.<\/p> <p>  A total of &euro;7.1 million in current and capital funding is being provided towards the cost of activities of the Land Development Agency in 2022 ahead of the imminent capitalisation through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.<\/p><p>There has been more than &euro;45 million funding for the operational budgets of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Office of the Planning Regulator and Ordnance Survey Ireland.<\/p><p> I thank members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#C00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State.

When we first saw it, we saw a plan.  We also saw a multi-annual budget, which is crucial to the delivery of many of these housing solutions.  When Housing for All is broken down programme by programme, with a funding stream assigned to each, phrases like \"Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe\", \"First Homes\", \"Project Tosaigh\" and so on start coming to life.  That is welcome.<\/p> <p>  Many members of the committee, especially those on the Government side, feel that a significant body of work has been done over the past two years in trying to deliver legislation that gave approved housing bodies, AHBs, local authorities, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and others the ability to deliver a wide range of solutions for housing.  Having all of the various programmes is key.  Sometimes, the housing crisis is painted as one problem with one solution, but we know that there is much more to it than that.  That said, we can see from these Estimates a significant commitment to the idea of public housing and different types of solution that allow communities like mine to deliver mixed-income housing.  That is crucial.  I come from a community in Ballymun and Finglas that was built as a solution to a housing crisis in previous decades.  We know that we did not get everything right in such communities.  Perhaps we put in too many houses and not enough supports and there was not the right mix in some areas.  This is why I welcome each of the tools.  AHBs and local authorities must now use them together to deliver on the ground.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about delivery.  A figure of &euro;4 billion is referenced.  It comes from &euro;2.6 billion in capital funding as well as funding from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, and the LDA.

I expect the LDA, through Project Tosaigh, to work through a number of proposals that it has received on activating dormant planning permissions while focusing that development on affordable and social housing.<\/p> <p>  We have different funding streams working together to deliver social homes at a level that we have never seen before.  This is the 9,000 new builds out of the 11,820 that we want to deliver this year, made up by acquisition and leasing.  On the affordable housing side, we are targeting 4,100 homes this year while building up the capacity to reach an average of 6,000 over the course of the plan.  I believe that we can do more than that.  There is immense potential in cost rental in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#D00600","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1231,"content":"<p>I am conscious of those two programmes because my community in Ballymun is halfway through a master plan that started nearly 20 years ago.

We could not deliver mixed-income housing with that legislation.  The programmes are important.<\/p> <p>  There are 28 ha of land in public ownership across 19 sites.

I hope that the Department will be in a position to support the council across the city, but specifically in respect of the sites in Ballymun.  While this is about providing housing, it is also about delivering on the promise of the regeneration plan.  This is a major opportunity.

I am a big supporter of home ownership.  We need to deliver homes by all mechanisms possible.  I am not hung up on ideology.  I do not care who builds the homes, be that councils, approved housing bodies, the LDA, public-private partnership or private builders, so long as homes are built.  For that to happen, we need a plan, political will and investment.  We have a plan, Housing for All, which is a multiannual plan.  We have the political will and we can see very clearly that we have multi-billion euro investment behind that plan to deliver much-needed homes<\/p> <p>  I particularly welcome the affordable housing fund of &euro;60 million and the allocation of &euro;44 million towards the shared equity loan scheme, which will help bridge the affordability gap for young couples, young families and other people who are now looking to purchase.  It is great to see 1,500 voids provided for in terms of council homes that will be refurbished, retrofitted or turned around quicker so that 1,500 families can avail of them.  I welcome the investment in terms of vacancy.  I particularly welcome the &euro;12 million allocation for repair and lease.  An issue that arises again and again in committee is the lack of local authority targets for schemes like this.  Was funding for last year fully drawn down and how do we make sure this year's allocation is fully drawn down?<\/p> <p>  From an LDA perspective, it is fantastic to see the commitment in terms of affordable and cost rental homes with 1,000 such homes to be delivered this year.  I welcome the level of investment in the AHBs, first homes, cost rental and retrofitting.  All of these are really practical measures that will make a huge difference on the ground.  LIHAF enables the delivery of homes and local infrastructure.  My own area has benefited from the URDF.  The Minister visited Tandy's Lane Park in Lucan and Adamstown where he saw first-hand how well that funding is being so well spent in growing communities.  Funding has been allocated for the establishment of the housing commission.  I am particularly interested in hearing if there is any update on when the planned referendum will take place.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the Ministers of State, Deputy Peter Burke and Deputy Noonan, it is great to hear so much from a heritage perspective in terms of the Heritage Council, our built heritage and our natural heritage, which are all big amenities for us as a society.  It was to great hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, that Traveller accommodation funding provided last year was fully drawn down.  That was an issue in previous years.<\/p><p>It is great to see local authorities fully utilising these funds.  <\/p><p> The Department has allocated quite a large amount of money in support of disability in older people accommodation.  It will be key to see how local authorities use this.<\/p><p> The rates waiver which the Minister has spoken about has been a very significant lifeline to businesses up and down this country and it is great to see it provided for and further rolled out this year.  <\/p><p> The 132 regeneration projects that the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has spoken about are all a significant part of the plan and it is very encouraging to see the funding allocation spelled out on the diagrams on pages four and five and exactly how much of this is going directly into the delivery and support of housing.  That is a top priority of this Government and it is great to see that there in black and white in that report.<\/p><p> On the affordable housing fund, it would be great to receive some information around the regulations that will be published as part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#E03900","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, wish to go ahead or-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#F00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>A number of issues have been raised by Deputy Higgins which the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, can deal with and I will return to speak on the housing issues then if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#F00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Higgins very much.

We see that as a very significant priority because it is an area that needs considerable focus into the future.  Everyone is aware of the challenges in rural areas of trying to bring derelict or vacant properties back into use and in allowing these to realise their potential in the local community.  <\/p> <p>  Something which the Deputy also referred to which is very important is the Traveller accommodation budget.  I acknowledge that we still have very substantial challenges in that area but we are working very hard with families to support them.  <\/p> <p>  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, report last year was very chilling and I have met with staff of the office.  I also met with the rights commissioner last year to try to advance our proposals.

It has set out its programme of work, working currently on 18 of the 32 recommendations.  That is a very challenging area.  As a father of two young children I am fully aware of the pressures that arise in that field and I am working also very hard to deliver in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#F00400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Higgins, in the first instance, for all of her work on this committee in support of the Housing for All strategy.  The year 2022 is going to be a very significant one.  The Deputy has outlined a number of different funding streams for the delivery of affordable housing.  I have been out in Tandy's Lane with the Deputy also.  I see our local authorities, like South Dublin County Council and others, are very progressive in driving things forward.  We need more of that and we are providing the funding to do that.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned something else to Deputy &Oacute; Broin earlier on in a response, which is that I want our local authorities and its our members to have transparency over what the targets are in their own areas which is important.  We all know that we have to deliver new homes for people across our social, affordable, private and cost rental sectors.     I believe it will be very significant if we can deliver and build more than 4,000 affordable homes this year basically from nothing, which I intend that we do.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the housing commission and the referendum.  The commission has been established and had its first meeting under the chairpersonship of John O&rsquo;Connor.  This will be a superb commission comprising a good group of people with a breadth of knowledge and experience.  Part of its terms of reference is to proceed with work on the provision of details for a referendum on housing.  It is something that we have committed to in the programme for Government and which I would like to see.  The commission, independently of me, will be working on that.  It is up and running and is doing that work already.<\/p> <p>  On social housing which the Deputy has also asked about, we set a new-build target of 9,000 houses in one year.  That will be very significant and will require all of our local authorities, including my Department, to be working together to deliver something that they have never come close to in recent years.  This is a significant jump up but the pipeline is good, not just for this year but for next year and into the future.  We need to be able to support that through resources.  That is why the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and I made the announcement in respect of additional housing staff, engineers, quantity surveyors and architects.  Those skills at local authority level right across the country are so important.  I hope I have responded to the points raised by the Deputy and I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#F00500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Higgins.  I will take the next slot now. Deputy McAuliffe covered the Housing for All strategy and all of the work that went into that very well.  I will not go through that again.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to concentrate on water and water services, especially in programme B.  I note that if we do not look after our water supplies and wastewater treatment, one cannot have any houses or development.  Water is critical to that and I am glad to see the funding in place for that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister visited us in Wicklow at the official opening of the Vartry Water Treatment Plant there.  I note that the Environment Protection Agency has announced that 130,000 people have been taken off the remedial action list because of the investment in that facility.  That is critical.  <\/p> <p>  I also pay tribute here, while I have the opportunity, to Ned Fleming who is the caretaker of that facility and is an absolute legend in water treatment throughout Wicklow and no doubt across Ireland and I wish him well.  I do not know if he is retired but I believe he is headed in that direction.<\/p> <p>  I know that the river basin management plan is into phase 3 now.  I remember when that started way back in order that we could meet the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive 2000\/60\/EC.  That is also a positive.<\/p> <p>  The Arklow wastewater treatment plant is also a very significant investment in Arklow for which we have waited a very long time.  I see the latest photographs and we receive regular updates from Irish Water on that.  That site has been cleared now since the date we were down there for its official launch.  That will be critical to improving the quality of the water and the marine environment around Arklow and Arklow Harbour.  I remember many years ago when the investment was made in Shanganagh wastewater treatment plant, when I believe the former Minister, John Gormley, was in office.  That actually allowed Bray to win its blue flag back a number of years later.  <\/p> <p>  There are a whole range of benefits that accrue to society, including in health, tourism and quality of life, when one has good wastewater treatment and drinking water.  It is not something that gets attention much of the time because pipes in the ground are not things that really excite people too much but they are very important.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise one issue on B.7, the legacy water environmental issues and possibly B.4, the rural water programme.  I have a situation in north Wicklow in an area that was once probably rural but because of urbanisation is now an urban area around which much housing has been built.  This relates to a number of houses which are on individual septic tanks and the mains foul water network is now running past.  What is in place for those areas, which would not be classed as rural as they are urban now but would have been rural at one stage, to try have these taken on board?  What funding does that come under?  Is it the rural water programme or does it come under legacy water environmental issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#F00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1279,"content":"<p>With respect to the Chairman, I wish to return, first, to a couple of points.<\/p> <p>  Arklow and Vartry are two very good examples mentioned there by the Chairman, one which relates to fresh and state-of-the-art drinking water supplies and plant in Vartry and then Arklow, where we have had untreated wastewater since virtually forever going into the Arklow River and polluting that area.  We now have a &euro;134 million investment into our wastewater treatment there.  There are many other such examples.  That is why it is important that we have the Irish Water programme of direct Exchequer funding of approximately &euro;4.9 billion over the next number of years, but where it has sight of its capital plan of &euro;6 billion between now and 2026.<\/p> <p>  To address the Chairman's question on a smaller settlement that has become urbanised, I expect those settlements to be dealt with where Irish Water has published its capacity plan and that these would be in its capital framework.  It is not necessarily a legacy issue.  It is an issue but I would not see it as falling under that programme and we will confirm the position there.<\/p> <p>  Very shortly, I am talking about a matter of weeks here, I intend to bring a programme forward that will partner with our local authorities in towns and villages, but mainly in villages and rural settlements that do not have any Irish Water wastewater infrastructure at all.<\/p><p>As part of the plan, the local authority would bring forward an acquired piece of land that has planning permission.  We would assess that piece, provide a grant to the local authority to tender and procure those works and, when the works are completed, then hand them over.  <\/p><p> For argument's sake, I visited communities such as Broadford, County Clare.  It is quite a substantial settlement with no wastewater treatment at all.  Unfortunately, there are approximately 665 settlements such as that all over the country.  We will not fix them all overnight.  However, I want to see a programme where Irish Water is advancing on one side and our local authorities can advance on the other.  <\/p><p> We will open a fund, which I referenced it in my opening statement, and the local authorities will bring forward shovel-ready projects.  I want stuff moving.  I do not want to be coming forward with a plan that will take a long time.  There are things we can do right now. <\/p><p> The level of investment in Irish Water by this Government is unprecedented.

Offshore energy will be critical to us in meeting our energy demands.  Energy is so costly now, that when we achieve that energy resilience of having 5 GW of offshore wind in the east and a target of 30 GW over the next decade after that, it puts us on the path of not being dependent on fossil fuels.  <\/p> <p>  It is critical that MARA has the budget to get up and running quickly to do what it is set up to do, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be judging these planning applications that come in from maritime area planning and it is not something it has dealt with to a huge extent before.

It is very important that we have a streamlined planning process to harness the resource of offshore wind for energy security and offshore renewables, in particular.<\/p> <p>  I approved the workforce plan in An Bord Plean&aacute;la for additional staff, who are now being recruited.  We will need more experts on the water side, in particular, and in relation to marine planning and development.  Those posts will be advertised very shortly.

The &euro;194 million is a significant increase on the pre-Covid years.  We are not seeing a like-for-like reduction.  We put in additional measures and expenditure will not be an issue.  My big focus is on helping many people who are homeless back into permanent accommodation and expanding Housing First for those with complex needs, including addiction, mental health and others.  A total of 1,300 new tenancies in that space will be underpinned by what we are doing.   It is a significant increase on the pre-Covid year of 2019.  I will come back on standards, which I would like to talk about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#H00500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>It is fantastic to see the energy and enthusiasm the Minister has brought to the Department, as have his junior Ministers, over the past 19 months.  They have hit the ground running.  In particular, over the last quarter and the start of 2022 we have seen real success in the battle against the housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is the bainisteoir and is here with his bainisteoir c&uacute;nta and my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is not here because I wanted to pay tribute to the work he is doing in heritage.  I have seen first hand small community groups heartened by the enthusiasm he has shown.  I hope the message can be passed on to him.  Though the Minister is the figurehead, it is important to acknowledge the team in the Custom House.  We can see the amount of work and effort gone into the Housing for All plan.  It is clear to see there is a fantastic team behind the Minister and we look forward to the results over the next three years or so.<\/p> <p>  I was heartened in the last week to see our first Fresh Start success in Longford in a matter of five weeks.  We can be cynical about these things sometimes but to see that coming through so quickly was a ringing endorsement of the work being done in the Department.  Everybody involved has to be commended.  It was great to hear that woman who thought she would never get her life back on track after a difficult separation get equity in a Dublin property and started her life again in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  It will come as no surprise that I will ask about affordable housing and Housing for All.  Affordable housing cannot be just centred on Dublin and the big metropolitan centres.  The Minister already has his housing delivery plans across the 31 council areas.  Is there a dedicated component and target for affordable housing in each of those delivery plans?  On engagement with local authorities at this stage on affordable housing, will the Minister indicate how many local authorities are actively engaging?  He will appreciate I am obsessed with one local authority, namely, Longford, but I still get a sense it will be difficult for those counties to get it over the line.  I cannot tell the Minister enough how real an issue affordable housing is across the country.  If we do not tackle it in rural areas and provincial towns, we will not tackle it nationwide.  <\/p> <p>  Where are we in relation to the launch of the affordable purchase shared equity scheme?  When will it be ready?  It is not clearly set out but I assume that is just for new builds.  If we are struggling to get affordable housing up and running in rural Ireland, there is an opportunity for some counties to tweak that to include second-hand house purchases and enable people hanging on for affordable housing to get onto the property ladder.  I am not looking for it nationwide but a specific and targeted approach across a number of counties might be worthwhile.  <\/p> <p>  The Chair spoke about Irish Water, which is an area of expertise for him.  There are concerns across the country about Irish Water.  Irish Water today revealed a figure of &euro;13 million for the cost of repairs and leaks in Longford over the past two years.  That is, on average, just under &euro;18,000 a day being spent on leaks and repairs.  At the same time, we are struggling to see that body put in place a decent infrastructure to allow the local authority move ahead with its plans.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the non-seweraged villages initiative and the Minister's plans to work with local authorities.  For example, for a town like Ballymahon that is maxed out in terms of its capacity, will there by an opportunity for the local county council to come up with a proposal on the basis that Irish Water's capital plan is unlikely to deliver a solution for that town for the next three to five years?  Is there an opportunity for the council to come to the Minister with its own bespoke plan and seek funding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#H00600","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1317,"content":"<p>The non-seweraged villages initiative will relate to that purely.  Towns and villages that have existing treatment plants will not apply for that fund.  I want to get this up and running.  I think it can have an impact.  The regular capital plan can apply there.  I can talk to the Deputy separately about that.<\/p> <p>  He is 100% right and the affordability measures being brought forward do not just relate to Dublin, Cork or the main cities.  I signed off on the first number of affordable purchase homes by way of advance purchase arrangements today.  I cannot tell the Deputy where they are but they are outside Dublin and Leinster.  I want to see the spread across the country.<\/p> <p>  The first home shared equity scheme will apply to all first-time buyers or buyers under the Fresh Start principle.  I welcome what the Deputy said on Fresh Start.  It is a principle that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and I, as well as our Government, absolutely believe in.  Someone who has had a change in life circumstances, gone through personal insolvency or is starting again should be supported and will be through the measures we are bringing forward as a Government, like we have done with the changes to the local authority affordable housing loan.  We have made significant changes there for singles.  <\/p> <p>  The first home shared equity scheme will apply to new builds, first and foremost.  I do not envisage a change.  That will start at the end of quarter 2 and be operational at the beginning of quarter 3.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages fund will be a opportunity for vacant properties in our regions.  Young and not-so-young couples and Fresh Start and other individuals will get assistance in refurbishing a property to bring it back to use should they wish to live in it.  We are targeting initially 2,500 homes.  We want to see how it works and if we need to change it, we will do so.  I am excited about that initiative.  It will make a major difference but we will need to manage it.  I expect the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages fund to be announced this quarter, that is, quarter 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#H00700","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1318,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the discussions here today.

I want to make sure that we are planning and providing stability for young couples who opt for the affordable housing options.

I did not mean to sidestep her question.  To answer it, the affordable purchase regulations will be published in the coming weeks, in March.  Some work is being done on it.  The cost-rental regulations have been published already.  We need to tell people the parameters within which they need to operate.  As I said to Deputy Flaherty, the first home shared equity scheme will be initiated at the end of the second quarter and operational at the start of the third quarter.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;4 billion means that people who have been waiting for years on the social housing list will see a ramping up of new-build delivery through our partners in approved housing bodies and local authorities, to provide over 9,000 new builds per year and to get it up to 10,000.  We will also allow for elements of acquisition and a small element of leasing, because real families have been waiting for these homes.  That will provide capacity of 90,000 social homes for us to start making progress on the lists.<\/p> <p>  People who are working, saving, renting and so on now have a couple of options.  Cost rental did not exist 12 months ago.  We focused on passing the Affordable Housing Act.  Tenants are in place, with more receiving tenancies in Leixlip and there will be tenants on Enniskerry Road, which is the first local authority scheme.  There is a group of nine different schemes, which I have not published yet, which will be delivered this year too.  There are hundreds of new, safe and secure tenancies for real people at 40% to 50% below market rates.  Policy and plans are important but there is nothing more important than delivery in order that people can see this is actually changing.  On the affordable housing side, we will have directly-built, local authority-led affordable homes, with people buying them this year.  The first is in Boherboy, Cork, followed shortly by Dun Emer, Lusk, and there will be more.  We need to build capacity in the local authority sector to do that.  It will not be able to deliver hundreds or thousands this year.  We will supplement that through the LDA, which we are funding, and through the first home shared equity scheme.  An individual or young couple will now be able to bridge that gap of unaffordability.  The State is rightly saying that it backs homeownership and will help people to own homes.  We want that for younger people.  We have to keep working to ensure that happens.  We may have to adjust as we progress.  We have a real plan, with real money, and we will see real delivery this year.

He may have missed our comments on that in the opening statements.  Funding has increased significantly in 2022.  The historical structures fund is in place and will fund about 100 projects.  More than 150 projects across the country, many of which I have been able to visit, will be funded under the community monuments fund.  What is great about that fund is that it gets local communities involved with their local history.  Local authorities and their heritage officers have done a superb job bringing people on board with them.  In some instances, the amounts of money involved are small but they make a massive difference to local communities and generate interest in history and the sites on our doorsteps that most of us did not know about before the pandemic.

The new standards the Dublin Regional Homelessness Executive, DRHE, has drawn up for private, for-profit providers of emergency accommodation are clearly informed by HIQA.  HIQA is the body with the experience and expertise in inspecting areas and settings where people may be vulnerable and need care and support.  That should certainly be the case with emergency accommodation for the homeless.  People should get support but in some circumstances that is not the case.  Will HIQA be appointed to do that?  It is critically important.  It would cut out many of the problems in that sector.  I would like the Minster's view on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#K01600","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1348,"content":"<p>We have discussed this matter a number of times.  I am glad the Deputy continues to highlight it.  I have established the national homeless action committee, as he knows.  I want standards in this area, especially private emergency accommodation, dealt with.  The Deputy mentioned the DRHE's new standards for emergency accommodation, which focus on private emergency accommodation.  They are an adaptation of the national quality standards framework, NQSF, standards.<\/p><p>It is a question of their application and of the wraparound services.  I was on outreach myself recently and, from talking to people who are out on the ground, I believe that we may not have the same level of wraparound services in some private emergency accommodation as we have in the State-run sector.  That needs to be addressed.  The situation is improving on where it was.  I know that from talking to practitioners on the ground and from going out with the outreach teams.  <\/p><p> To be honest, we can do better in that space.  That is why I am very focused on the homelessness action committee, which is not just made up of officials from my Department.  That is very important.  It also includes representatives from the Departments of Justice and Health and I chair it.  All of the main NGOs have also agreed to be part of it.  That is a standing committee within Government.  The new standards are welcome but it is a question of their application.  If there is an easier way to do it, perhaps through the standards being applied directly by HIQA, I am not opposed to that.  I want to get there.  I have been told that the lead-in time to do that would be quite extensive.  I have to work with partners to see how we can do that.  <\/p><p> Obviously, we all want to see a reduction in the use of emergency accommodation.  We have changes in the demographics of the individuals and families who are accessing emergency accommodation, which makes it quite difficult to plan with regard to our capacity.  That is why it is important that the Departments of Health and Justice, Tusla and others are involved in this process.  I chair the committee myself.  We have to ensure that all of those people have security, standards and wraparound services.  I met a gentleman last week who will not go into hostels in Dublin.  He had been beaten up twice.  When he was sleeping out in Dublin, he was beaten up for a cigarette.  I have visited really good own-room hostels that have their own lockers, good services and nurses and doctors on board but not every hostel is at that standard.  It is our challenge to achieve that.  Our real challenge is to make sure the young lad I met last week has a safe place to live.  He is working away.  There are others with very complex needs.  That is why the expansion of Housing First is also really important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#K01700","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1350,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  It is important that he acknowledged that we could do a lot better in some of those areas.  Exactly as the Minister said, there are people who actually feel safer on the street than in some of the very badly run private emergency accommodation out there.  There are different standards between different operators.  As the Minister said, the survey done by Mendicity showed that more than 90% of those in private emergency accommodation who were surveyed had either been assaulted or robbed in private emergency accommodation.  It is appalling that people are in that vulnerable situation in accommodation funded by the State, albeit not run by the State.  As the Minister said, it is important to have the standards but it is their application that matters.  There is no one better to ensure they are applied and to carry out inspections than HIQA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022021000002#L00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1644451200,"counter":1351,"content":"<p>I do not want to take up the Deputy's time but may I mention one quick thing?

I note subhead F8, which relates to peatlands restoration, conservation and management.  I am once again talking about carbon emissions.  What the restoration of our peatlands can do for us with regard to carbon sequestration is absolutely incredible.  It also provides jobs in those midland areas.  It is about the natural management of water, which can aid in addressing the flooding we often see in midland areas.  That is key and I am glad to see that budget is there.

There is the 100% grant, the 80% grant for smaller works and the grant of up to 50% for large-scale jobs.  There was also mention of the Land Development Agency, LDA.  The chair designate, Cormac O'Rourke, came into us recently.  We had a really good session with the LDA and many of us left confident of the work it will do.  It is a critical agency with regard to managing the land and pulling it together.  The land aspect has always been key in making housing affordable.<\/p> <p>  I will move to planning and the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF.  The Minister has visited many parts of the country to see the benefits that fund has brought about.  Local authorities need to have the funding in place to develop a pipeline because it costs them money to design these projects so they are ready for when the funding grants are announced.  I hope that local authorities have a small amount of funding to develop their plans so that, when funding is announced, they are shovel-ready and ready to go.  I hope that is in place.<\/p> <p>  On energy efficiency and retrofitting, the planning exemption for solar panels is critical.  We are coming into the sunny season now.  There are megawatts of potential power up there in the sun.  We could have panels on every school building, community building, farm building and church building out there to generate energy predominantly for on-site use, but with the ability to feed back into the grid.  That work on microgeneration is due shortly.  I have covered a lot.  I do not know whether the Minister can answer some of those questions.

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, may want to come in on some points.  With regard to the URDF, work has been done in the Chairman's constituency of Wicklow, specifically Wicklow town.  I have seen the work there.  Public realm work has been completed in Tralee and Ennis.  There are some fantastic projects there.  We need to see ground being broken on those projects.  There are some very significant projects, such as those on the north quays in Waterford and on the quays in Cork, that will really drive regeneration forward to support commercial investment and people living in our towns and villages, which is something the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has been working very hard on.  Some &euro;1.7 billion has been allocated across hundreds of very significant projects right across the country.  We expect to have another round of URDF funding this year.  We support the local authorities in making their plans.  The Chairman will see where they are phased.  In Balbriggan in my own constituency, Fingal County Council applied for funding to do the detailed planning that allowed them to unlock an additional &euro;25 million to rejuvenate the town centre and the harbour in the town.  There is immense potential there.
