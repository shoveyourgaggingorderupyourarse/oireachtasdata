Families are missing out on holidays because of long delays in issuing passports, hotels are charging between &euro;350 and &euro;400 for one night and now the State's main airport is experiencing chaos.  Dublin Airport on Sunday was a nightmare for those caught up in the mayhem.  People waited hours in queues that stretched outside the terminal buildings.  Passengers received no communication, updates or explanations for the delays.  Indeed, many had not even made it to the security check before their flights took off without them.  More than 1,000 people missed their flights.  Big money had to be forked out for hotel rooms, connecting flights were missed and would-be holidaymakers had their holidays ruined.  Now, confusion surrounding what any compensation package will cover is sowing further frustration.  This is not only about tourism and holidays.  As a small island nation, we rely heavily on our airports to ensure our connectivity with the rest of the world.  We simply cannot afford this chaos.  Last week's events at the airport risk damaging Ireland's international reputation for international business and investment.<\/p>  <p>  All of this has its roots in the laying off 1,000 workers by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, during the pandemic and the subsequent lack of workforce planning as international travel reopened.  At the time of those lay-offs, SIPTU's Jerry Brennan told the airport authority, \"you will need to be hiring people because your queues will be extending through the carparks\".  What foresight.  It seems he was the only person with any foresight.  Yet, as we speak, Dublin Airport is still only at 70% of pre-Covid staffing levels.  How can we expect the country&rsquo;s main airport to operate at such low staff levels at the busiest time of the year?  It was entirely foreseeable, after two years of lockdowns, that people would be very eager to get away on holidays again.  Sunday&rsquo;s chaos did not come out of the blue.  There were warnings in the major delays in March and April.  What action, if any, did the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, take then to get ahead of all this?  Did he meet the airport authority back in March to work out solutions and prevent an escalation of the problem?  He is now calling for solutions in the wake of chaos.  He has shown up again a day late and a dollar short.<\/p>  <p>  Teip thubaisteach ar thaobh an Rialtais agus an DAA a bh&iacute; sa phraiseach ioml&aacute;n ag Aerfort Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath ar an Domhnach.

When the operation of the most important airport in the State breaks down, it is the business of the Government to get ahead of that.

The scenes at Dublin Airport that we all witnessed on our screens at the weekend are completely unacceptable.  Passengers going through the airport should not have had to endure an experience like that and I can only imagine the stress, anxiety and anger that was caused to so many of them.  Many of them had been saving long and hard for a well-earned holiday and, in too many instances, did not make their flight through absolutely no fault of their own.  What we saw was unacceptable and it cannot be allowed to happen again.<\/p>  <p>  It is the case the DAA has statutory responsibility for the running of Dublin Airport but of course, as a Government, we take a direct interest in this matter because of the impact it has on the people we represent and on Ireland's reputation, both domestically and internationally, and the importance for us as an island nation of having international connectivity and airports that are well run and well resourced and that meet the needs of the people.<\/p>  <p>  These issues began to emerge in March and there was significant intervention at that point, which continued.  In particular, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, had very regular meetings - every second day, in fact - for a period with the DAA to ensure this issue was properly addressed.  To be fair, for the great bulk of that period, the issues were addressed and the types of scenes we witnessed at the weekend were not evident over that period.  Since the weekend, there was a meeting yesterday involving the Minister for Transport, the Minister of State and the DAA's senior management to express the Government's deep frustration and unhappiness with the scenes we witnessed at the weekend.  There was a further meeting this morning at which the DAA was asked to come forward with an operational plan to ensure we do not see scenes like this again, and to provide a reassurance to passengers going to Dublin Airport this coming weekend, which will be a busy, long weekend, that adequate resources are in place to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, DAA senior management will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications tomorrow.  The Minister and the Minister of State have asked that the details of the operational plan be conveyed publicly and discussed at that meeting.  Importantly, they have asked that there be an effective communications campaign in order that passengers who are relying on the services at Dublin Airport know exactly what is ahead of them and precisely how long they should allow to safely get through the various stages of check-in, security and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to point out a voluntary severance scheme was operated by the DAA over the course of 2020 and into 2021, which was the authority's judgment as to the resources it would need for the period ahead.  It was also in the context of a period when passenger levels had simply collapsed and the DAA was losing enormous sums weekly, and it proposed a severance scheme.  In recent months, it has recruited several hundred staff.  About 300 of the 370 additional security staff required have been recruited and about 170 of those are fully trained.  The DAA has had more than 5,000 applications for the positions since the start of March.<\/p>  <p>  It is important the public are given a reassurance that what we saw at the weekend does not happen again.  The Government has reinforced that message to the DAA directly and the public will see tomorrow the details of what it is proposing operationally to ensure it does not happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100004#B00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1654002300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Minister said there was a significant political intervention in March and April, when these problems emerged.

The management of the Dublin Airport Authority, it seems to me, grossly misjudged what the capacity requirements would be as travel reopened, as was always going to be the case.<\/p> <p>I must say I do not hear anything from the Minister, as a Minister in government, that would reassure me or reassure the public that in fact the airport authority or the Government have got on top of this issue.

It is not fair on the members of the public who rely on the services at the airport to go about their business, travel abroad, see loved ones, return home after a trip to Ireland or go on business abroad.  They should be assured that if they turn up in good time for their flight, the airport will do its job and get them through the various stages and get them on board.  There was a detailed discussion today about what is required to ensure that is achieved, including measures to improve queue management and maximising the availability of staffing resources to increase the number of security lanes at peak times.  The DAA is now finalising those operational arrangements and we expect to hear much more about them in the next 24 hours and of course the authority will appear before the Oireachtas joint committee.

Clearly, these have had a devastating effect for so many people.  We know 1,000 people have missed their flights and that people missed out on job opportunities, work-related travel, funerals, weddings, holidays and so much more.  Clearly, this is a huge issue of consumer rights and a huge issue for those passengers who were so seriously inconvenienced over the weekend.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is not just a matter of poor planning by the DAA, although that is clearly a serious issue in itself, but also points to two broader issues for which the Government must take responsibility.  The first is a failure of our national aviation policy, specifically, a failure to ensure effective distribution of flights among our airports, because it is not just about Dublin Airport and we are conscious many people are now looking to other airports like those in Cork or Farranfore.  They are looking at airports where there is capacity and seeing the contrast between them and the chaos we saw at the weekend at Dublin Airport.  It is, therefore, about a national aviation policy that must take into account distribution of workload among our regional airports.<\/p>  <p>  It is also, at a broader level, about workers' rights.  That is something our transport spokesperson, Deputy Duncan Smith, has been raising consistently for some time now.  We saw the DAA lay off staff during Covid in significant numbers and we saw the Government failing to put in a no-redundancy clause as a condition of the State supports that were being granted.  We know the DAA took advantage of those supports, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, that comes to an end today, yet there was no conditionality around workers' rights in that.  We heard this morning from an anonymous worker at Dublin Airport about the serious issues around workplace conditions and pay that pertain for the many staff at Dublin Airport.  Many of them took the brunt of understandable passenger frustration at the weekend and so many of them are in such a low-paid sector.  The real concern we have is we have seen Dublin Airport become a low-cost airport, as the preponderance of low-cost airlines has dominated and we have seen a race to the bottom as a result.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister first to reassure passengers that we will not see the same chaotic scenes at the airport this weekend.  Will he also assure the House there will be a proper and effective national aviation strategy put in place to ensure this imbalance between one airport and our other airports does not occur again?  Will the Government also take steps to ensure the serious staffing issues and the low-pay conditions for so many staff at Dublin Airport are addressed and that we see better conditions for staff and a genuine commitment to move to a living wage, as we saw in our Labour Party Bill on a living wage?<\/p> <p>Last week, we welcomed the T&aacute;naiste's announcement that the Government will introduce legislation on a living wage.  We are conscious that Ireland has a serious problem with low pay, with one in five of the workforce low paid.  It is not just about Dublin Airport, but clearly that was a major factor in the staffing shortfall that led to such chaotic scenes for so many at the weekend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100005#C00300","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654003200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The decision of the DAA in May 2020 to embark on a voluntary severance scheme was against the backdrop at the time of a collapse in the aviation industry and the commercial reality that it was losing an enormous amount of money daily.  It proposed a voluntary severance scheme and there was significant uptake of the scheme.  It is also fair to say that the recovery in aviation has exceeded the expectations of the majority of commentators, and I believe it has exceeded the DAA's own expectations, to be frank.  That is why in recent weeks, as manifested and crystallised at the weekend in such a terrible way, it simply did not have the level of staffing resources that it needed.  It is a good thing that aviation has recovered much more quickly than was forecast, but it is important that the DAA upholds the integrity of the security arrangements at the airport to the highest possible standards.  Its first priority is to ensure the safety of the passengers who are going through the airport and, indeed, those who work in the airport.<\/p>  <p>  There has been significant interest in the recruitment campaign.  I heard what the Deputy said about terms and conditions but more than 5,000 applications since the beginning of March indicates a high level of interest in the security roles that are available.  It is important to point out that the terms and conditions of employment are negotiated and agreed on a collective basis between the DAA and the trade unions representing the staff there.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Government's wider aviation policy, we have a policy that supports the regions.  There is a regional airports programme.  Just last month, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, announced capital funding not just for the airports that traditionally avail of the regional airports programme and of the public service obligation, PSO, such as Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport Knock, but also included for the first time the State regional airports at Cork and Shannon in the regional airports programme.  Both of them benefited from capital funding, which I believe was the correct decision.  By virtue of the size of passenger numbers at those airports, they are now eligible for funding under the programme.  It is anticipated there will also be a round of operational grant aid under the regional airports programme.  Almost &euro;22 million is available in operational support during this year to support measures such as air traffic control, fire services and security-related operations at airports.  There will be invitations to apply for that operational aid and it will issue to eligible airports towards the latter half of the year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's strategy is to support regional airports, including the State regional airports, which all provide an excellent quality of service and provide competition for Dublin Airport, which is needed too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100006#D00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1654003200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response on the aviation strategy as it relates to airports such as Shannon, Cork and Farranfore.  I also heard what he said about the recovery of aviation.  However, this was not unpredictable.  Airlines sold flights, so the number of people who would be flying out of Dublin Airport last weekend was utterly predictable.  Clearly, there was a serious problem, a serious failure of workforce planning.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the issue of staff conditions and pay, the trade unions at Dublin Airport have been raising this for some time.  There is a serious issue again with retention of staff and that is related to the pay levels and the conditions that apply to staff at the airport.  That has to be addressed to ensure we do not see these shortfalls on an ongoing basis.  I repeat our concern about Dublin Airport effectively becoming a low-cost airport at a time when inflation is rising above 8% today and there is a cost-of-living crisis that is really biting into so many people's pockets and incomes.  That is why the Labour Party has been saying that Ireland needs a pay rise and why we have been pushing for enactment of a Bill that would transform the minimum wage into a living wage.  We call on the Government to adopt the principle in our Bill.  That would bring about a much quicker transformation, a much speedier increase in the incomes people earn and would address some of the issues with low pay that are affecting staff numbers in Dublin Airport and in so many other places around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100006#D00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1654003800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The DAA has major obligations as an employer.

That is why it is in the process of a significant recruitment campaign, which has attracted a lot of interest.  It has offered existing security staff contracts with a minimum of 30 hours per week.  The contract requires staff to be available to work 40 hours across a 24-7 roster, with employees notified 30 days in advance of their next four-week schedules.  In reality, most staff work more than the guaranteed minimum hours, and overtime is available.  Permanent security staff are employed on a pensionable and secure basis, and all the DAA arrangements are collectively bargained for.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's wider point in respect of pay, there are, as she knows, negotiations under way on public pay in Ireland.  That will impact on 365,000 public servants across the country.  I hope we will be able to reach a successful conclusion on that matter in the next short number of weeks.

It will be a protest against the Government's spectacular failure to address the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Today, we have more evidence of the Government's failure in this regard.  EUROSTAT has indicated that we are facing inflation of 8.3%.  This means that the value in purchasing power terms of workers' wages, pensions and incomes will drop by more than 8%, meaning real cuts in income for the people who can least afford them.  Then we have the Taoiseach warning of a new era of high energy prices.  That is on top of a 42% increase in energy and heating costs for ordinary people in the past year alone.<\/p>  <p>  Against this background of a cost-of-living crisis, the Government acts like a helpless, innocent bystander that can do absolutely nothing about it.  The Government is not going to do anything before the budget, and it is totally unclear whether it will do anything at all.  That is why people are coming onto the streets.<\/p>  <p>  Even the crisis in Dublin Airport is linked to this problem.  In a word, the problem there is that the DAA, which has executives on total packages in excess of &euro;366,000, expects the security workers it hires to operate on rubbishy flexible contracts for &euro;14 an hour.  When they cannot even plan and will not even know what hours they will have and, therefore, what income they will have in a week's time, is it any wonder that the DAA has difficulty recruiting people?  The chief executive overseeing this is on a package of &euro;366,000 a year.  That is the problem in the context of the bigger crisis we face.<\/p>  <p>  More than 600,000 people in this country are suffering deprivation and there are hundreds of thousands of workers are on low pay.  However, spectacular profits are being made by the energy companies.  Last year, Energia's profits were up 46% and the ESB's were up to nearly &euro;700 million.  Even Boris Johnson, a Tory, can introduce a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies to try to get some revenues to protect ordinary people from the cost-of-living crisis, but this Government will not do what even Boris Johnson is doing - and, my God, he is no left-winger.  When is the Government going to bring in emergency measures in respect of housing costs, the slaughtering of people's incomes and a cost of living that is crucifying ordinary people?  What is going to be in that package?

He knows that.  In the most recent budget, and the measures since, we have introduced a package of approximately &euro;2.4 billion of taxpayers' money to support households because we recognise and acknowledge the impact of the extraordinary level of inflation that is currently being experienced.  Of course, an inflation rate of more than 8% is a real concern because it impacts on people, living standards and the competitiveness of businesses.<\/p>  <p>  This is a global phenomenon.  We have to acknowledge that.  In the UK, the rate is 9%.  In the US, it is 8.5%.  In today's EUROSTAT publication, 12 of the 19 eurozone countries have rates of inflation that are higher than Ireland's.  That is why we responded.  It is why the Government continues to ensure that we can fund the measures we have already announced, including the reduction in VAT and excise duty.  As the Deputy is aware, we have brought in two separate bullet payments for fuel allowance recipients, a &euro;200 energy credit in respect of electricity bills for all households and a cut to the PSO levy from October.  There is a major multi-annual national retrofitting scheme.  We have put caps on school transport fees for families.  We have cut transport fares by 20%, with an additional 50% cut in fares for young people.  We reduced the drugs payment scheme threshold to &euro;80 per month, benefiting more than 70,000 families.  We brought forward the changes announced in the most recent budget in respect of the working family payment.  We completely abolished any hospital charges for children overnight.  There are also targeted measures.  For example, the 9% rate for tourism and hospitality has, as the Deputy will be aware, been extended.  We also introduced specific measures in the haulage sector.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, introduced a suite of measures to support the tillage sector, farmers, and rural communities.  I do not expect Deputy Boyd Barrett to give the Government any credit for that.  He wants more to be done.  That is a reasonable political position to adopt.<\/p>  <p>  What we, as a Government, are seeking to do is navigate our way through this.  In order to help the country to get through this period, we are engaging in social dialogue with the main social partners, through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, the trade unions and the employer bodies.  The national economic dialogue will take place on 20 June.  This will provide an opportunity for a wider set of stakeholders and Opposition parties also to set out their positions.  However, we also need to be honest with people.  These are extraordinary times.  This is a record level of inflation.  It has never happened before in the eurozone.  In fact, it is global.  We will do the best we can as a Government to support and assist people, and we have to date, but it is not possible for any government to introduce measures to completely offset the impact of a terrible war in Ukraine, which has caused such dislocation in the energy markets and in relation to so many foods and materials across the supply chain.  We acknowledge that it is having an impact and that is why we have responded to date.  That is why we are finalising our budgetary position as we move towards the summer economic statement and the preparation of the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100008#F00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1654004100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The reason so many people have got involved in this new Cost of Living Coalition - pensioners groups, retired workers groups, student unions, single-parent advocacy groups, anti-poverty groups, trade unions and others - is because the measures the Government has been taking are a drop in the ocean; they are making little or no difference to the crucifying increases in the cost of living that people face.  The key point is that people are acutely aware that this is a tale of two crises.  Ordinary working people, pensioners and students are being hammered with the cost of inflation, but they see simultaneously that some people are doing very well out of it.  The Oxfam report published last week shows that Ireland's nine billionaires saw their assets and wealth increase by 55% last year.  The energy companies see their profits going through the roof.

It is also revealed in correspondence between the HSE and HIQA, dated 7 March this year, that HIQA's deputy chief inspector of social services called for &quot;The review of governance structures should not be limited to local... level but should also include the overall national governance and oversight structures used to identify and respond to issues that may arise...&quot;.<\/p><p><i>The Medical Independent <\/i>revealed that a social care risk register for the safeguarding and protection team, SPT, dating from 2021, showed that risks related to staffing were ongoing.  The SPT has been operating at 75% capacity since March 2020 due to staff redeployment.  There was a risk of the SPT &quot;not being able to continue to provide a cohesive service across CHO 1 if staffing falls any further due to leave or illness of remaining staff&rdquo;.  On 28 June 2021, another staffing risk was recorded, which was due for review on 3 July.  It read:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDue to 50 per cent reduction in staff there is a significant risk that the safeguarding team may not be in a position to provide a cohesive service across CHO 1 [again].  We currently have no staff in Donegal and have lost 0.5 of our staff in Cavan\/Monaghan. <\/blockquote>  <p>This was all happening while I was being told by the HSE that everything was fine.<\/p><p>I do not believe these allegations are new to the HSE.  They were part of what the whistleblower told me in 2006, they were part of what I brought to the HSE at that time, and were in the available HSE files at Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court.  I believe they were suppressed by management within the HSE at all levels, right up to the very top, and only for the dogged determination of the whistleblower, these journalists, myself and, thankfully, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, all this would have been conveniently swept under the carpet.<\/p><p>I am calling on the Government and the senior Minister finally to stand up to the HSE, to stop accepting mediocre management and lack of transparency and to get the Brandon report and other linked reports published in full, so we can confidently put in place the measures to ensure this never happens again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100009#G00400","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1654004700,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.

We can respond to the Deputy on a bilateral basis in more detail.<\/p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 does not extend to people who are involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 or detained subject to an order under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  The Attorney General's office has identified legal issues that need to be addressed before the 2015 Act can be extended, specifically around ensuring that detention orders continue to be valid in cases where all treatment is refused.  The Government supports the extension of the principles and provisions of the Act and its 2022 amendment Bill to individuals whose treatment is regulated by Part 4 of the Mental Health Act.  The Government will extend these provisions to this cohort of people through the mental health Bill, which is being drafted.<\/p>  <p>  People accessing mental health services generally can avail of decision-making supports under the 2015 Act, including people receiving treatment on a voluntary basis in approved centres.  The Act provides for the introduction of decision-making supports to help individuals with impaired decision-making abilities to make decisions about finances, healthcare and personal matters.  The Act is not yet fully commenced.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has prepared an amendment Bill, which is expected to pass through the Oireachtas this month.  Its amendments will allow the Act to be fully commenced.  Currently, the 2015 Act's provisions do not apply to people whose treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act, those being, people who are involuntarily detained under that Act and people detained under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.<\/p>  <p>  On a parallel track, the Department of Health is progressing a mental health Bill based on the general scheme agreed by the Government last July.  It is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has put a considerable amount of work into it.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office.  While the official advice has not been received, the Department has been informally told that, if the 2015 Act is amended so that its provisions fully apply to people detained under the Mental Health Act, there is a risk that, where such an individual refuses all treatment, the basis for his or her detention may become invalidated.  The Attorney General's office has advised that further work is needed to safeguard against a situation arising in which people who pose a risk to others cannot be detained and treated where they refuse all treatment.  The office has also advised that this policy work would be more appropriately addressed in the mental health Bill.  That Bill will significantly update and overhaul existing mental health legislation, including provisions relating to consent to treatment under Part 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100010#H00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1654005300,"counter":26,"content":"<p>That concludes Leaders' Questions.

I will speak to the Brandon report.  This is a long, drawn-out saga and what stands out to me is that HSE management failed the residents of Ard Greine Court, who are vulnerable adults for whom we as a society are asked to care.  HSE management also failed Brandon, a highly vulnerable adult.  Importantly, in the ensuing mismanagement of the case, the HSE has failed its front-line staff as well.  The concealment of the truth at any cost, which to my mind is the only conclusion one can draw as being the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of the management's response, is dictated from the very top of the HSE.  This leaves the staff on the ground abandoned even though they were the ones highlighting the problems throughout.  This is not a Donegal or CHO 1 problem alone.  It is a national problem.

Will the Minister consider speaking to the Ulster Council and the wider GAA in regard to whether it would be possible to have a rotating Ulster final, whereby Clones would not completely lose its 100-year tradition of holding the Ulster final and, perhaps, as is the case in Cork and Kerry, a rotating final could be considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100016#Q00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1654008600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Elections Act 1997 for the purposes of providing for same day voting on islands at elections and referendums. <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputy McAuliffe.  The purpose of this motion is to instruct the D&aacute;il in committee, pursuant to Standing Order 187, that it has power to make amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill.  In this regard, I propose to introduce amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, to be held in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann later this afternoon.  The Committee Stage amendments to the Bill in the motion are twofold and comprise amendments to the Electoral Act 1997, and amendments to the provision for island voting in the Electoral Act 1992, the Presidential Elections Act 1993, the Referendum Act 1994, the Local Elections Regulations 1995, the Local Government Act 2001 and the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.<\/p><p>I will now set out the amendments to the scope of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 relating to the Electoral Act 1997, or Part 6 of the amended Bill.  As the House will be aware, Programme for Government - Our Shared Future commits the Government to reviewing &ldquo;our current electoral laws and the conduct of politics in Ireland, to ensure that donations and resources from non-citizens outside the State are not being utilised to influence our elections and political process.&rdquo;  It goes on to state we will legislate to prevent this if necessary.<\/p> <p>In late January 2021, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I wrote to all 25 political parties on the register of political parties seeking their views on the regulation of electoral funding from outside the jurisdiction of the State and on other related matters in the context of the Government commitment.<\/p> <p> The amendments I intend to move on Committee Stage of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 arise as a result of that consultation process and were informed by further engagement between my Department and Government parties.  In summary, the proposed amendments will: strengthen the definition of \"subsidiary organisation\" to clarify that it includes a body or association which maintains an office outside the State; amend the definition of \"donation\" to confirm that it includes any donation from a subsidiary organisation located outside the State; update the definition of \"institution\" in the light of changes in the financial services sector and to include credit unions within its meaning, which will allow political donations accounts to be opened within credit union institutions for the first time; prohibit the acceptance of donations of any value in the form of a cryptocurrency; impose a new obligation on the leaders of political parties to provide a written statement and an accompanying statutory declaration in respect of each year to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, stating that all donations from outside of the State, whether in cash or in kind, have been declared and that no other donations, either in cash or in kind, took place; insert new requirements into the Act to confirm that the preparation of the annual statements of accounts must be in accordance with guidelines published by SIPO and with the relevant requirements of the FRS 102 financial reporting standard and the inclusion of all property in the ownership or control of the political party and its subsidiary organisations when the annual statements of accounts are being prepared; and provide a wide range of investigatory powers to SIPO, as the body currently responsible for regulatory oversight under the Act.<\/p> <p> These provisions are modelled on similar powers in the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  The proposed amendments are designed to strengthen and enhance the transparency measures already in place around the funding of our political system and will further protect our democracy against malign foreign influence at a time of unprecedented global threats.<\/p> <p> The second set of amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 included in this motion will amend the Electoral Act 1992, the Presidential Elections Act 1993, the Referendum Act 1994, the Local Elections Regulations 1995, the Local Government Act 2001 and the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to provide for same-day island voting at all elections and referendums in Ireland.  These amendments will ensure polling at elections and referendums on the islands will take place on the same day as the rest of the country.  The amendments would be inserted into the Bill by way of a new Part 7 and an amendment to section 3 of the Bill, and will amend the Electoral Acts mentioned as follows.  The amendments will remove the existing provisions in the Electoral Acts that currently allow returning officers to take the poll on islands at elections and referendums up to five days before the appointed polling day where, in the opinion of the returning officer, it would be impracticable due to stress of weather or transport difficulties to either take the poll on the appointed polling day or to deliver the ballot boxes to the count centre by 9 a.m. the following day, if the poll were to go ahead on polling day.<\/p> <p> The amendments to the Bill will also insert new provisions into all electoral codes to allow the Minister the power to make an order to shorten polling hours on an island at an election or referendum where it would be unnecessary or impracticable to have full polling hours due to local circumstances and taking account of the advice of the returning officer.  Such an order must be made no later than seven days before polling day and the amended polling period must not be less than four hours.  The returning officer would be required to give public notice in the polling district of the times and date of the poll.  The local circumstances to be considered include the size of the electorate on the island, distance between a polling station on an island and the count centre, advance weather forecasts or foreseen transport difficulties.  Accordingly, the amendments to the Bill will amend the existing provisions in the Electoral Acts, which currently allow for polling hours on islands to be reduced on polling day itself where weather or transport difficulties affect the commencement of the poll or the timely delivery of ballot boxes to the count centre, in order to clarify that these are emergency provisions to be used only in the event of unforeseen weather or transport difficulties on polling day itself.  The amendments to the Bill will amend the preliminary procedures for the counting of votes in the Electoral Acts to allow returning officers, in the event of weather or transport difficulties at an election or referendum that would give rise to the late arrival of ballot boxes from a polling station on an island, to proceed with the opening of ballot boxes and the verification of ballot paper accounts for each box that have been received.  These tasks typically take a number of hours to complete and the proposed amendments would allow these tasks to be commenced pending the late arrival of ballot boxes from a polling station on an island.<\/p> <p> I look forward to the debate on the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100016#Q02700","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654009200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for allocating to me the remaining part of his time.

On the Bill itself, this legislation is of enormous importance.  Repeatedly during our discussions both as part of pre-legislative scrutiny and on Second Stage, it was described as a once-in-a-generation Bill.  I echo Deputy McAuliffe's description of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  It was probably the most detailed done in this Oireachtas and a very significant amount of time was taken by members and witnesses.  It was also one of the most collegiate and cross-party pre-legislative scrutiny processes we have had.  There was broad agreement among members, irrespective of party, on the need for the most modern, well-resourced and independent electoral commission, electoral register and subsequent processes to ensure our electoral processes into the future are free, fair, democratic and of the highest possible integrity.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness to the Minister, he indicated early on there was an intention to bring a range of non-consequential amendments and he wrote to members of the committee outlining the general areas in which he intended to do that.  I thank the Department and its officials for organising a detailed briefing yesterday that a number of us attended.  It was helpful because, even with the best will in the world, some of these amendments are very technical and it is much better to have had that briefing before we go to Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in warmly welcomes both sets of non-consequential amendments.  During the last D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had a Private Members' motion on modernising the voting arrangements on the islands passed and we supported that.  My colleagues, in particular Deputies Doherty and Mac Lochlainn, were very vocal on it in the last Oireachtas and previously and we are very happy to support those amendments.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the amendments dealing with the Electoral Act 1997, anything that increases the transparency, accountability and visibility is warmly welcomed.  We have no difficulty with the amendments whatsoever and will be supporting them later on.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to echo what Deputy McAuliffe said.  The Chair of the committee and the committee itself have made it clear there is no guillotine and we will take as much time as we need to go through these amendments.  Members may have technical questions on the consequential or, indeed, the non-consequential amendments.  There will be plenty of time for debate around that.  We will return here for Report and Final Stages before the Bill goes to the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  I have a final point, and again it is in the spirit of collegiality we had during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Deputy McAuliffe made a fair point on the speaking time.  If he had spoken to me beforehand, I would have happily given him a few minutes of my time if he needed it.  We need to return to the issue of the regulation of online social media platforms and advertising on those platforms and our electoral processes.  There was a very strong sense from all members of the committee - opposition and government members - that while the provisions in the Bill are welcome, they are weak.  It is incumbent on us, once this Bill is passed, to return and have a wider conversation about that.<\/p> <p>I believe there is an appetite in the committee to ensure that the same principles and values that underpin the strong restrictions on buying advertising in mainstream media should apply to social media as well.  We are very fortunate that we do not have the type of malign influence that certain forms of financial investment have in other liberal democracies around the world, and we should ensure those same principles apply to media.  I assure Deputy McAuliffe he has friends on this side of the House if he wants to pursue that.<\/p> <p> However, we must get this Bill through and get the electoral commission established.  It has to be an electoral commission of strength and substance, with adequate resourcing and with the power to conduct the crucial pieces of research that the Government was not willing to include in this Bill, so it can recommend further reform into the future.  I look forward to the committee's debate today, tomorrow and Friday and, indeed, next week, if that is deemed necessary by the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100017#R00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654009800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I agree with what Deputies &Oacute; Broin and McAuliffe said.  The pace of change in the evolution of online platforms is such that we will not be in a position to wait two, three, five or ten years for a reappraisal of the utility and effectiveness of this legislation.  It is an important start, but we have to remain ahead of the game and keep a watching brief on how the evolution of those platforms impacts on the way we do politics in this country, the way we campaign and the activities of citizens and others, especially those from outside the State, in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this debate, but I do not think it is a debate that we should have had to force, in essence.  It became abundantly clear that the amendments tabled by the Minister of State for the select committee strayed well beyond the original intentions of the legislation as initiated and as debated on Second Stage a few weeks ago.  For a long time my party, a party that is largely responsible for much of the ethical framework that now governs Irish politics and for the change introduced some years ago relating to corporate donations and so forth, has been campaigning and committed to updating and modernising the framework in respect of how we fairly finance politics in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The rules we introduced about a decade ago succeeded in flushing big money corporate donations out of Irish politics to a real extent, but the bequest of cash and assets worth more than &pound;2 million from the late William Hampton to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and that party's acceptance of it exposed some of the frailties of our system and some of the anomalies that exist between both jurisdictions on this island.  It appears that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, agrees.  That was clearly outlined in correspondence it issued to the Labour Party in response to concerns we raised with it.  It seems that a party that is registered and active in both jurisdictions can accept limitless amounts of cash in the North regardless of the restrictions here.  I am not saying that as a criticism necessarily; I am saying it is a fact of life.  That is the reality and it is incumbent on us as legislators and on anybody who wishes to see a more transparent system of politics and the financing of politics on this island to call that out and to propose solutions to what is a real problem.  Frankly, I would not look to what I describe as the corrupt and amoral UK system of political financing to set a benchmark for the framework of ethics in politics in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments from the Minister of State reflect some of the reforms that I proposed in my Second Stage contribution on this Bill.  Little did I think that such extensive reforms would be proposed to be inserted into the legislation at this point, welcome as the amendments are in principle.  The way in which the Bill has been wholesale amended with the intention of shunting it very hastily into the select committee, as we will do from this afternoon, is no way to do business.  I hope the House will accept that.  As I said on the Order of Business last week, these reforms are critical to the proper functioning of politics and of our democracy.  The D&aacute;il should have been given ample time to interrogate the proposals from the Minister of State properly.  I accept we will do that on Committee Stage in the select committee and on Report Stage and that the process will be mirrored in the Seanad, but we should have been afforded the opportunity to have sight of the Minister of State's proposals on Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>  We also did not have ample opportunity to propose amendments to the Minister of State's amendments.  Two amendments have been circulated this afternoon.  One of them is from me and one is from the Minister of State.  That is an imperfect way of doing business late in the day.  Quite frankly, it is unsatisfactory and it can lead to the making of bad law and to unintended consequences.  Officials in the Department said at the very welcome briefing yesterday, which we all welcomed and found very useful, that many of the ideas reflected in the amendments came from the consultation that was undertaken with the political parties in 2021.  That was an important consultation.  However, if we are to accept that, surely we should accept that those changes should have been reflected in the initial Bill and not brought forward in such a hasty fashion.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time I have left I will speak to some of the amendments.  Bringing so-called subsidiary organisations into the ambit of the financing and donations sphere is very important, as is the requirement to declare all properties owned by political parties and subsidiary organisations and put them into the ambit of the system.  We know that most wealth in this country is held not in cash but in assets, such as land and property.  Where there are assets such as wealth in property there is wealth and that has to be recorded.  We must be very clear about who owns those properties and assets.  That is in the public interest.  It is important, too, that annual statutory declarations will have to be made by party leaders and that these will include all donations from subsidiary organisations from outside the State.  It is interesting that the Department confirmed in the briefing yesterday what I had suspected from my first reading of the relevant amendment, which is that this will not be governed by donation thresholds currently in place but instead it will apply to all donations in cash or coin from outside the State.  That is an interesting proposal and I expect we will have some detailed debate about it.  My understanding is that donations can still be made by citizens residing outside of the State in the normal way, once they are within the SIPO personal and corporate donations thresholds.<\/p>  <p>  It is also very welcome that official accounting standards in terms of the recording and presentation of accounts will be required if the Minister of State's amendments are accepted, and I expect many of them will be.  Again, this is very important for transparency and consistency.  It will mean that every party will know what its obligations are, what the reporting and accounting standards are and, significantly and critically, the general public will be able to compare and contrast the financial position of each registered party.  Nobody involved in politics in this country and nobody who is committed to democracy should fear transparency.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage later today and throughout the week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100018#S00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1654009800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>First, I welcome this Bill.  It is important legislation.  Establishing an electoral commission is long overdue.  It is an important measure, and the main thrust of the Bill is one I welcome.  As I outlined on Second Stage, I have a slightly different take on this from that of other parties.  While I welcome the legislation as very good, it is weak in some places and must be strengthened, especially in areas around voter education.  I have tabled amendments on that which we will discuss shortly on Committee Stage.  I hope the Government is able to accept some of those amendments.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the other Deputies about the importance of ensuring there is strong regulation of what happens online on social media during elections.  It is an area that is not sufficiently regulated, and the Bill does not do it sufficiently.  There has to be very strong transparency regulation and restrictions in that area.  It is certainly something on which I am happy to work with other Deputies and other parties.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the process in respect of the later amendments that have been introduced by the Government, I have no issue with being flexible and efficient in the legislative process but we must have a certain amount of time built in to allow for sufficient scrutiny.  To explain, we were given the briefing note from the Department on these new amendments when it was emailed to us at 12.05 p.m. today, approximately three and a half hours before this debate.  We have other things to do so it is not as if we can simply drop everything else and go straight to the briefing note and analyse it.  A group of these amendments are about more transparency in the electoral process, but we need more transparency in the legislative process, which means that if a briefing note is circulated about new amendments, and it a good idea to have a briefing note circulated, and it is received three and a half hours in advance, after only receiving the briefing yesterday, there is insufficient time to engage and to scrutinise properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100018#S00300","speaker":"1550"}]
