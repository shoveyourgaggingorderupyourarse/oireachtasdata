Families are missing out on holidays because of long delays in issuing passports, hotels are charging between &euro;350 and &euro;400 for one night and now the State's main airport is experiencing chaos.  Dublin Airport on Sunday was a nightmare for those caught up in the mayhem.  People waited hours in queues that stretched outside the terminal buildings.  Passengers received no communication, updates or explanations for the delays.  Indeed, many had not even made it to the security check before their flights took off without them.  More than 1,000 people missed their flights.  Big money had to be forked out for hotel rooms, connecting flights were missed and would-be holidaymakers had their holidays ruined.  Now, confusion surrounding what any compensation package will cover is sowing further frustration.  This is not only about tourism and holidays.  As a small island nation, we rely heavily on our airports to ensure our connectivity with the rest of the world.  We simply cannot afford this chaos.  Last week's events at the airport risk damaging Ireland's international reputation for international business and investment.<\/p>  <p>  All of this has its roots in the laying off 1,000 workers by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, during the pandemic and the subsequent lack of workforce planning as international travel reopened.  At the time of those lay-offs, SIPTU's Jerry Brennan told the airport authority, \"you will need to be hiring people because your queues will be extending through the carparks\".  What foresight.  It seems he was the only person with any foresight.  Yet, as we speak, Dublin Airport is still only at 70% of pre-Covid staffing levels.  How can we expect the country&rsquo;s main airport to operate at such low staff levels at the busiest time of the year?  It was entirely foreseeable, after two years of lockdowns, that people would be very eager to get away on holidays again.  Sunday&rsquo;s chaos did not come out of the blue.  There were warnings in the major delays in March and April.  What action, if any, did the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, take then to get ahead of all this?  Did he meet the airport authority back in March to work out solutions and prevent an escalation of the problem?  He is now calling for solutions in the wake of chaos.  He has shown up again a day late and a dollar short.<\/p>  <p>  Teip thubaisteach ar thaobh an Rialtais agus an DAA a bh&iacute; sa phraiseach ioml&aacute;n ag Aerfort Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath ar an Domhnach.

When the operation of the most important airport in the State breaks down, it is the business of the Government to get ahead of that.

The scenes at Dublin Airport that we all witnessed on our screens at the weekend are completely unacceptable.  Passengers going through the airport should not have had to endure an experience like that and I can only imagine the stress, anxiety and anger that was caused to so many of them.  Many of them had been saving long and hard for a well-earned holiday and, in too many instances, did not make their flight through absolutely no fault of their own.  What we saw was unacceptable and it cannot be allowed to happen again.<\/p>  <p>  It is the case the DAA has statutory responsibility for the running of Dublin Airport but of course, as a Government, we take a direct interest in this matter because of the impact it has on the people we represent and on Ireland's reputation, both domestically and internationally, and the importance for us as an island nation of having international connectivity and airports that are well run and well resourced and that meet the needs of the people.<\/p>  <p>  These issues began to emerge in March and there was significant intervention at that point, which continued.  In particular, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, had very regular meetings - every second day, in fact - for a period with the DAA to ensure this issue was properly addressed.  To be fair, for the great bulk of that period, the issues were addressed and the types of scenes we witnessed at the weekend were not evident over that period.  Since the weekend, there was a meeting yesterday involving the Minister for Transport, the Minister of State and the DAA's senior management to express the Government's deep frustration and unhappiness with the scenes we witnessed at the weekend.  There was a further meeting this morning at which the DAA was asked to come forward with an operational plan to ensure we do not see scenes like this again, and to provide a reassurance to passengers going to Dublin Airport this coming weekend, which will be a busy, long weekend, that adequate resources are in place to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, DAA senior management will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications tomorrow.  The Minister and the Minister of State have asked that the details of the operational plan be conveyed publicly and discussed at that meeting.  Importantly, they have asked that there be an effective communications campaign in order that passengers who are relying on the services at Dublin Airport know exactly what is ahead of them and precisely how long they should allow to safely get through the various stages of check-in, security and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to point out a voluntary severance scheme was operated by the DAA over the course of 2020 and into 2021, which was the authority's judgment as to the resources it would need for the period ahead.  It was also in the context of a period when passenger levels had simply collapsed and the DAA was losing enormous sums weekly, and it proposed a severance scheme.  In recent months, it has recruited several hundred staff.  About 300 of the 370 additional security staff required have been recruited and about 170 of those are fully trained.  The DAA has had more than 5,000 applications for the positions since the start of March.<\/p>  <p>  It is important the public are given a reassurance that what we saw at the weekend does not happen again.  The Government has reinforced that message to the DAA directly and the public will see tomorrow the details of what it is proposing operationally to ensure it does not happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100004#B00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1654002300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Minister said there was a significant political intervention in March and April, when these problems emerged.

The management of the Dublin Airport Authority, it seems to me, grossly misjudged what the capacity requirements would be as travel reopened, as was always going to be the case.<\/p> <p>I must say I do not hear anything from the Minister, as a Minister in government, that would reassure me or reassure the public that in fact the airport authority or the Government have got on top of this issue.

It is not fair on the members of the public who rely on the services at the airport to go about their business, travel abroad, see loved ones, return home after a trip to Ireland or go on business abroad.  They should be assured that if they turn up in good time for their flight, the airport will do its job and get them through the various stages and get them on board.  There was a detailed discussion today about what is required to ensure that is achieved, including measures to improve queue management and maximising the availability of staffing resources to increase the number of security lanes at peak times.  The DAA is now finalising those operational arrangements and we expect to hear much more about them in the next 24 hours and of course the authority will appear before the Oireachtas joint committee.

Clearly, these have had a devastating effect for so many people.  We know 1,000 people have missed their flights and that people missed out on job opportunities, work-related travel, funerals, weddings, holidays and so much more.  Clearly, this is a huge issue of consumer rights and a huge issue for those passengers who were so seriously inconvenienced over the weekend.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is not just a matter of poor planning by the DAA, although that is clearly a serious issue in itself, but also points to two broader issues for which the Government must take responsibility.  The first is a failure of our national aviation policy, specifically, a failure to ensure effective distribution of flights among our airports, because it is not just about Dublin Airport and we are conscious many people are now looking to other airports like those in Cork or Farranfore.  They are looking at airports where there is capacity and seeing the contrast between them and the chaos we saw at the weekend at Dublin Airport.  It is, therefore, about a national aviation policy that must take into account distribution of workload among our regional airports.<\/p>  <p>  It is also, at a broader level, about workers' rights.  That is something our transport spokesperson, Deputy Duncan Smith, has been raising consistently for some time now.  We saw the DAA lay off staff during Covid in significant numbers and we saw the Government failing to put in a no-redundancy clause as a condition of the State supports that were being granted.  We know the DAA took advantage of those supports, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, that comes to an end today, yet there was no conditionality around workers' rights in that.  We heard this morning from an anonymous worker at Dublin Airport about the serious issues around workplace conditions and pay that pertain for the many staff at Dublin Airport.  Many of them took the brunt of understandable passenger frustration at the weekend and so many of them are in such a low-paid sector.  The real concern we have is we have seen Dublin Airport become a low-cost airport, as the preponderance of low-cost airlines has dominated and we have seen a race to the bottom as a result.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister first to reassure passengers that we will not see the same chaotic scenes at the airport this weekend.  Will he also assure the House there will be a proper and effective national aviation strategy put in place to ensure this imbalance between one airport and our other airports does not occur again?  Will the Government also take steps to ensure the serious staffing issues and the low-pay conditions for so many staff at Dublin Airport are addressed and that we see better conditions for staff and a genuine commitment to move to a living wage, as we saw in our Labour Party Bill on a living wage?<\/p> <p>Last week, we welcomed the T&aacute;naiste's announcement that the Government will introduce legislation on a living wage.  We are conscious that Ireland has a serious problem with low pay, with one in five of the workforce low paid.  It is not just about Dublin Airport, but clearly that was a major factor in the staffing shortfall that led to such chaotic scenes for so many at the weekend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100005#C00300","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654003200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The decision of the DAA in May 2020 to embark on a voluntary severance scheme was against the backdrop at the time of a collapse in the aviation industry and the commercial reality that it was losing an enormous amount of money daily.  It proposed a voluntary severance scheme and there was significant uptake of the scheme.  It is also fair to say that the recovery in aviation has exceeded the expectations of the majority of commentators, and I believe it has exceeded the DAA's own expectations, to be frank.  That is why in recent weeks, as manifested and crystallised at the weekend in such a terrible way, it simply did not have the level of staffing resources that it needed.  It is a good thing that aviation has recovered much more quickly than was forecast, but it is important that the DAA upholds the integrity of the security arrangements at the airport to the highest possible standards.  Its first priority is to ensure the safety of the passengers who are going through the airport and, indeed, those who work in the airport.<\/p>  <p>  There has been significant interest in the recruitment campaign.  I heard what the Deputy said about terms and conditions but more than 5,000 applications since the beginning of March indicates a high level of interest in the security roles that are available.  It is important to point out that the terms and conditions of employment are negotiated and agreed on a collective basis between the DAA and the trade unions representing the staff there.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Government's wider aviation policy, we have a policy that supports the regions.  There is a regional airports programme.  Just last month, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, announced capital funding not just for the airports that traditionally avail of the regional airports programme and of the public service obligation, PSO, such as Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport Knock, but also included for the first time the State regional airports at Cork and Shannon in the regional airports programme.  Both of them benefited from capital funding, which I believe was the correct decision.  By virtue of the size of passenger numbers at those airports, they are now eligible for funding under the programme.  It is anticipated there will also be a round of operational grant aid under the regional airports programme.  Almost &euro;22 million is available in operational support during this year to support measures such as air traffic control, fire services and security-related operations at airports.  There will be invitations to apply for that operational aid and it will issue to eligible airports towards the latter half of the year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's strategy is to support regional airports, including the State regional airports, which all provide an excellent quality of service and provide competition for Dublin Airport, which is needed too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100006#D00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1654003200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response on the aviation strategy as it relates to airports such as Shannon, Cork and Farranfore.  I also heard what he said about the recovery of aviation.  However, this was not unpredictable.  Airlines sold flights, so the number of people who would be flying out of Dublin Airport last weekend was utterly predictable.  Clearly, there was a serious problem, a serious failure of workforce planning.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the issue of staff conditions and pay, the trade unions at Dublin Airport have been raising this for some time.  There is a serious issue again with retention of staff and that is related to the pay levels and the conditions that apply to staff at the airport.  That has to be addressed to ensure we do not see these shortfalls on an ongoing basis.  I repeat our concern about Dublin Airport effectively becoming a low-cost airport at a time when inflation is rising above 8% today and there is a cost-of-living crisis that is really biting into so many people's pockets and incomes.  That is why the Labour Party has been saying that Ireland needs a pay rise and why we have been pushing for enactment of a Bill that would transform the minimum wage into a living wage.  We call on the Government to adopt the principle in our Bill.  That would bring about a much quicker transformation, a much speedier increase in the incomes people earn and would address some of the issues with low pay that are affecting staff numbers in Dublin Airport and in so many other places around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100006#D00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1654003800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The DAA has major obligations as an employer.

That is why it is in the process of a significant recruitment campaign, which has attracted a lot of interest.  It has offered existing security staff contracts with a minimum of 30 hours per week.  The contract requires staff to be available to work 40 hours across a 24-7 roster, with employees notified 30 days in advance of their next four-week schedules.  In reality, most staff work more than the guaranteed minimum hours, and overtime is available.  Permanent security staff are employed on a pensionable and secure basis, and all the DAA arrangements are collectively bargained for.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's wider point in respect of pay, there are, as she knows, negotiations under way on public pay in Ireland.  That will impact on 365,000 public servants across the country.  I hope we will be able to reach a successful conclusion on that matter in the next short number of weeks.

It will be a protest against the Government's spectacular failure to address the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Today, we have more evidence of the Government's failure in this regard.  EUROSTAT has indicated that we are facing inflation of 8.3%.  This means that the value in purchasing power terms of workers' wages, pensions and incomes will drop by more than 8%, meaning real cuts in income for the people who can least afford them.  Then we have the Taoiseach warning of a new era of high energy prices.  That is on top of a 42% increase in energy and heating costs for ordinary people in the past year alone.<\/p>  <p>  Against this background of a cost-of-living crisis, the Government acts like a helpless, innocent bystander that can do absolutely nothing about it.  The Government is not going to do anything before the budget, and it is totally unclear whether it will do anything at all.  That is why people are coming onto the streets.<\/p>  <p>  Even the crisis in Dublin Airport is linked to this problem.  In a word, the problem there is that the DAA, which has executives on total packages in excess of &euro;366,000, expects the security workers it hires to operate on rubbishy flexible contracts for &euro;14 an hour.  When they cannot even plan and will not even know what hours they will have and, therefore, what income they will have in a week's time, is it any wonder that the DAA has difficulty recruiting people?  The chief executive overseeing this is on a package of &euro;366,000 a year.  That is the problem in the context of the bigger crisis we face.<\/p>  <p>  More than 600,000 people in this country are suffering deprivation and there are hundreds of thousands of workers are on low pay.  However, spectacular profits are being made by the energy companies.  Last year, Energia's profits were up 46% and the ESB's were up to nearly &euro;700 million.  Even Boris Johnson, a Tory, can introduce a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies to try to get some revenues to protect ordinary people from the cost-of-living crisis, but this Government will not do what even Boris Johnson is doing - and, my God, he is no left-winger.  When is the Government going to bring in emergency measures in respect of housing costs, the slaughtering of people's incomes and a cost of living that is crucifying ordinary people?  What is going to be in that package?

He knows that.  In the most recent budget, and the measures since, we have introduced a package of approximately &euro;2.4 billion of taxpayers' money to support households because we recognise and acknowledge the impact of the extraordinary level of inflation that is currently being experienced.  Of course, an inflation rate of more than 8% is a real concern because it impacts on people, living standards and the competitiveness of businesses.<\/p>  <p>  This is a global phenomenon.  We have to acknowledge that.  In the UK, the rate is 9%.  In the US, it is 8.5%.  In today's EUROSTAT publication, 12 of the 19 eurozone countries have rates of inflation that are higher than Ireland's.  That is why we responded.  It is why the Government continues to ensure that we can fund the measures we have already announced, including the reduction in VAT and excise duty.  As the Deputy is aware, we have brought in two separate bullet payments for fuel allowance recipients, a &euro;200 energy credit in respect of electricity bills for all households and a cut to the PSO levy from October.  There is a major multi-annual national retrofitting scheme.  We have put caps on school transport fees for families.  We have cut transport fares by 20%, with an additional 50% cut in fares for young people.  We reduced the drugs payment scheme threshold to &euro;80 per month, benefiting more than 70,000 families.  We brought forward the changes announced in the most recent budget in respect of the working family payment.  We completely abolished any hospital charges for children overnight.  There are also targeted measures.  For example, the 9% rate for tourism and hospitality has, as the Deputy will be aware, been extended.  We also introduced specific measures in the haulage sector.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, introduced a suite of measures to support the tillage sector, farmers, and rural communities.  I do not expect Deputy Boyd Barrett to give the Government any credit for that.  He wants more to be done.  That is a reasonable political position to adopt.<\/p>  <p>  What we, as a Government, are seeking to do is navigate our way through this.  In order to help the country to get through this period, we are engaging in social dialogue with the main social partners, through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, the trade unions and the employer bodies.  The national economic dialogue will take place on 20 June.  This will provide an opportunity for a wider set of stakeholders and Opposition parties also to set out their positions.  However, we also need to be honest with people.  These are extraordinary times.  This is a record level of inflation.  It has never happened before in the eurozone.  In fact, it is global.  We will do the best we can as a Government to support and assist people, and we have to date, but it is not possible for any government to introduce measures to completely offset the impact of a terrible war in Ukraine, which has caused such dislocation in the energy markets and in relation to so many foods and materials across the supply chain.  We acknowledge that it is having an impact and that is why we have responded to date.  That is why we are finalising our budgetary position as we move towards the summer economic statement and the preparation of the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100008#F00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1654004100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The reason so many people have got involved in this new Cost of Living Coalition - pensioners groups, retired workers groups, student unions, single-parent advocacy groups, anti-poverty groups, trade unions and others - is because the measures the Government has been taking are a drop in the ocean; they are making little or no difference to the crucifying increases in the cost of living that people face.  The key point is that people are acutely aware that this is a tale of two crises.  Ordinary working people, pensioners and students are being hammered with the cost of inflation, but they see simultaneously that some people are doing very well out of it.  The Oxfam report published last week shows that Ireland's nine billionaires saw their assets and wealth increase by 55% last year.  The energy companies see their profits going through the roof.

It is also revealed in correspondence between the HSE and HIQA, dated 7 March this year, that HIQA's deputy chief inspector of social services called for &quot;The review of governance structures should not be limited to local... level but should also include the overall national governance and oversight structures used to identify and respond to issues that may arise...&quot;.<\/p><p><i>The Medical Independent <\/i>revealed that a social care risk register for the safeguarding and protection team, SPT, dating from 2021, showed that risks related to staffing were ongoing.  The SPT has been operating at 75% capacity since March 2020 due to staff redeployment.  There was a risk of the SPT &quot;not being able to continue to provide a cohesive service across CHO 1 if staffing falls any further due to leave or illness of remaining staff&rdquo;.  On 28 June 2021, another staffing risk was recorded, which was due for review on 3 July.  It read:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDue to 50 per cent reduction in staff there is a significant risk that the safeguarding team may not be in a position to provide a cohesive service across CHO 1 [again].  We currently have no staff in Donegal and have lost 0.5 of our staff in Cavan\/Monaghan. <\/blockquote>  <p>This was all happening while I was being told by the HSE that everything was fine.<\/p><p>I do not believe these allegations are new to the HSE.  They were part of what the whistleblower told me in 2016, they were part of what I brought to the HSE at that time, and were in the available HSE files at Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court.  I believe they were suppressed by management within the HSE at all levels, right up to the very top, and only for the dogged determination of the whistleblower, these journalists, myself and, thankfully, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, all this would have been conveniently swept under the carpet.<\/p><p>I am calling on the Government and the senior Minister finally to stand up to the HSE, to stop accepting mediocre management and lack of transparency and to get the Brandon report and other linked reports published in full, so we can confidently put in place the measures to ensure this never happens again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100009#G00400","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1654004700,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.

We can respond to the Deputy on a bilateral basis in more detail.<\/p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 does not extend to people who are involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 or detained subject to an order under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  The Attorney General's office has identified legal issues that need to be addressed before the 2015 Act can be extended, specifically around ensuring that detention orders continue to be valid in cases where all treatment is refused.  The Government supports the extension of the principles and provisions of the Act and its 2022 amendment Bill to individuals whose treatment is regulated by Part 4 of the Mental Health Act.  The Government will extend these provisions to this cohort of people through the mental health Bill, which is being drafted.<\/p>  <p>  People accessing mental health services generally can avail of decision-making supports under the 2015 Act, including people receiving treatment on a voluntary basis in approved centres.  The Act provides for the introduction of decision-making supports to help individuals with impaired decision-making abilities to make decisions about finances, healthcare and personal matters.  The Act is not yet fully commenced.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has prepared an amendment Bill, which is expected to pass through the Oireachtas this month.  Its amendments will allow the Act to be fully commenced.  Currently, the 2015 Act's provisions do not apply to people whose treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act, those being, people who are involuntarily detained under that Act and people detained under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.<\/p>  <p>  On a parallel track, the Department of Health is progressing a mental health Bill based on the general scheme agreed by the Government last July.  It is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has put a considerable amount of work into it.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office.  While the official advice has not been received, the Department has been informally told that, if the 2015 Act is amended so that its provisions fully apply to people detained under the Mental Health Act, there is a risk that, where such an individual refuses all treatment, the basis for his or her detention may become invalidated.  The Attorney General's office has advised that further work is needed to safeguard against a situation arising in which people who pose a risk to others cannot be detained and treated where they refuse all treatment.  The office has also advised that this policy work would be more appropriately addressed in the mental health Bill.  That Bill will significantly update and overhaul existing mental health legislation, including provisions relating to consent to treatment under Part 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100010#H00100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1654005300,"counter":26,"content":"<p>That concludes Leaders' Questions.

I will speak to the Brandon report.  This is a long, drawn-out saga and what stands out to me is that HSE management failed the residents of Ard Greine Court, who are vulnerable adults for whom we as a society are asked to care.  HSE management also failed Brandon, a highly vulnerable adult.  Importantly, in the ensuing mismanagement of the case, the HSE has failed its front-line staff as well.  The concealment of the truth at any cost, which to my mind is the only conclusion one can draw as being the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of the management's response, is dictated from the very top of the HSE.  This leaves the staff on the ground abandoned even though they were the ones highlighting the problems throughout.  This is not a Donegal or CHO 1 problem alone.  It is a national problem.

Will the Minister consider speaking to the Ulster Council and the wider GAA in regard to whether it would be possible to have a rotating Ulster final, whereby Clones would not completely lose its 100-year tradition of holding the Ulster final and, perhaps, as is the case in Cork and Kerry, a rotating final could be considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100016#Q00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1654008600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Elections Act 1997 for the purposes of providing for same day voting on islands at elections and referendums. <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputy McAuliffe.  The purpose of this motion is to instruct the D&aacute;il in committee, pursuant to Standing Order 187, that it has power to make amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill.  In this regard, I propose to introduce amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, to be held in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann later this afternoon.  The Committee Stage amendments to the Bill in the motion are twofold and comprise amendments to the Electoral Act 1997, and amendments to the provision for island voting in the Electoral Act 1992, the Presidential Elections Act 1993, the Referendum Act 1994, the Local Elections Regulations 1995, the Local Government Act 2001 and the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.<\/p><p>I will now set out the amendments to the scope of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 relating to the Electoral Act 1997, or Part 6 of the amended Bill.  As the House will be aware, Programme for Government - Our Shared Future commits the Government to reviewing &ldquo;our current electoral laws and the conduct of politics in Ireland, to ensure that donations and resources from non-citizens outside the State are not being utilised to influence our elections and political process.&rdquo;  It goes on to state we will legislate to prevent this if necessary.<\/p> <p>In late January 2021, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I wrote to all 25 political parties on the register of political parties seeking their views on the regulation of electoral funding from outside the jurisdiction of the State and on other related matters in the context of the Government commitment.<\/p> <p> The amendments I intend to move on Committee Stage of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 arise as a result of that consultation process and were informed by further engagement between my Department and Government parties.  In summary, the proposed amendments will: strengthen the definition of \"subsidiary organisation\" to clarify that it includes a body or association which maintains an office outside the State; amend the definition of \"donation\" to confirm that it includes any donation from a subsidiary organisation located outside the State; update the definition of \"institution\" in the light of changes in the financial services sector and to include credit unions within its meaning, which will allow political donations accounts to be opened within credit union institutions for the first time; prohibit the acceptance of donations of any value in the form of a cryptocurrency; impose a new obligation on the leaders of political parties to provide a written statement and an accompanying statutory declaration in respect of each year to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, stating that all donations from outside of the State, whether in cash or in kind, have been declared and that no other donations, either in cash or in kind, took place; insert new requirements into the Act to confirm that the preparation of the annual statements of accounts must be in accordance with guidelines published by SIPO and with the relevant requirements of the FRS 102 financial reporting standard and the inclusion of all property in the ownership or control of the political party and its subsidiary organisations when the annual statements of accounts are being prepared; and provide a wide range of investigatory powers to SIPO, as the body currently responsible for regulatory oversight under the Act.<\/p> <p> These provisions are modelled on similar powers in the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  The proposed amendments are designed to strengthen and enhance the transparency measures already in place around the funding of our political system and will further protect our democracy against malign foreign influence at a time of unprecedented global threats.<\/p> <p> The second set of amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 included in this motion will amend the Electoral Act 1992, the Presidential Elections Act 1993, the Referendum Act 1994, the Local Elections Regulations 1995, the Local Government Act 2001 and the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to provide for same-day island voting at all elections and referendums in Ireland.  These amendments will ensure polling at elections and referendums on the islands will take place on the same day as the rest of the country.  The amendments would be inserted into the Bill by way of a new Part 7 and an amendment to section 3 of the Bill, and will amend the Electoral Acts mentioned as follows.  The amendments will remove the existing provisions in the Electoral Acts that currently allow returning officers to take the poll on islands at elections and referendums up to five days before the appointed polling day where, in the opinion of the returning officer, it would be impracticable due to stress of weather or transport difficulties to either take the poll on the appointed polling day or to deliver the ballot boxes to the count centre by 9 a.m. the following day, if the poll were to go ahead on polling day.<\/p> <p> The amendments to the Bill will also insert new provisions into all electoral codes to allow the Minister the power to make an order to shorten polling hours on an island at an election or referendum where it would be unnecessary or impracticable to have full polling hours due to local circumstances and taking account of the advice of the returning officer.  Such an order must be made no later than seven days before polling day and the amended polling period must not be less than four hours.  The returning officer would be required to give public notice in the polling district of the times and date of the poll.  The local circumstances to be considered include the size of the electorate on the island, distance between a polling station on an island and the count centre, advance weather forecasts or foreseen transport difficulties.  Accordingly, the amendments to the Bill will amend the existing provisions in the Electoral Acts, which currently allow for polling hours on islands to be reduced on polling day itself where weather or transport difficulties affect the commencement of the poll or the timely delivery of ballot boxes to the count centre, in order to clarify that these are emergency provisions to be used only in the event of unforeseen weather or transport difficulties on polling day itself.  The amendments to the Bill will amend the preliminary procedures for the counting of votes in the Electoral Acts to allow returning officers, in the event of weather or transport difficulties at an election or referendum that would give rise to the late arrival of ballot boxes from a polling station on an island, to proceed with the opening of ballot boxes and the verification of ballot paper accounts for each box that have been received.  These tasks typically take a number of hours to complete and the proposed amendments would allow these tasks to be commenced pending the late arrival of ballot boxes from a polling station on an island.<\/p> <p> I look forward to the debate on the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100016#Q02700","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654009200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for allocating to me the remaining part of his time.

On the Bill itself, this legislation is of enormous importance.  Repeatedly during our discussions both as part of pre-legislative scrutiny and on Second Stage, it was described as a once-in-a-generation Bill.  I echo Deputy McAuliffe's description of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  It was probably the most detailed done in this Oireachtas and a very significant amount of time was taken by members and witnesses.  It was also one of the most collegiate and cross-party pre-legislative scrutiny processes we have had.  There was broad agreement among members, irrespective of party, on the need for the most modern, well-resourced and independent electoral commission, electoral register and subsequent processes to ensure our electoral processes into the future are free, fair, democratic and of the highest possible integrity.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness to the Minister, he indicated early on there was an intention to bring a range of non-consequential amendments and he wrote to members of the committee outlining the general areas in which he intended to do that.  I thank the Department and its officials for organising a detailed briefing yesterday that a number of us attended.  It was helpful because, even with the best will in the world, some of these amendments are very technical and it is much better to have had that briefing before we go to Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in warmly welcomes both sets of non-consequential amendments.  During the last D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had a Private Members' motion on modernising the voting arrangements on the islands passed and we supported that.  My colleagues, in particular Deputies Doherty and Mac Lochlainn, were very vocal on it in the last Oireachtas and previously and we are very happy to support those amendments.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the amendments dealing with the Electoral Act 1997, anything that increases the transparency, accountability and visibility is warmly welcomed.  We have no difficulty with the amendments whatsoever and will be supporting them later on.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to echo what Deputy McAuliffe said.  The Chair of the committee and the committee itself have made it clear there is no guillotine and we will take as much time as we need to go through these amendments.  Members may have technical questions on the consequential or, indeed, the non-consequential amendments.  There will be plenty of time for debate around that.  We will return here for Report and Final Stages before the Bill goes to the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  I have a final point, and again it is in the spirit of collegiality we had during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Deputy McAuliffe made a fair point on the speaking time.  If he had spoken to me beforehand, I would have happily given him a few minutes of my time if he needed it.  We need to return to the issue of the regulation of online social media platforms and advertising on those platforms and our electoral processes.  There was a very strong sense from all members of the committee - opposition and government members - that while the provisions in the Bill are welcome, they are weak.  It is incumbent on us, once this Bill is passed, to return and have a wider conversation about that.<\/p> <p>I believe there is an appetite in the committee to ensure that the same principles and values that underpin the strong restrictions on buying advertising in mainstream media should apply to social media as well.  We are very fortunate that we do not have the type of malign influence that certain forms of financial investment have in other liberal democracies around the world, and we should ensure those same principles apply to media.  I assure Deputy McAuliffe he has friends on this side of the House if he wants to pursue that.<\/p> <p> However, we must get this Bill through and get the electoral commission established.  It has to be an electoral commission of strength and substance, with adequate resourcing and with the power to conduct the crucial pieces of research that the Government was not willing to include in this Bill, so it can recommend further reform into the future.  I look forward to the committee's debate today, tomorrow and Friday and, indeed, next week, if that is deemed necessary by the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100017#R00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654009800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I agree with what Deputies &Oacute; Broin and McAuliffe said.  The pace of change in the evolution of online platforms is such that we will not be in a position to wait two, three, five or ten years for a reappraisal of the utility and effectiveness of this legislation.  It is an important start, but we have to remain ahead of the game and keep a watching brief on how the evolution of those platforms impacts on the way we do politics in this country, the way we campaign and the activities of citizens and others, especially those from outside the State, in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this debate, but I do not think it is a debate that we should have had to force, in essence.  It became abundantly clear that the amendments tabled by the Minister of State for the select committee strayed well beyond the original intentions of the legislation as initiated and as debated on Second Stage a few weeks ago.  For a long time my party, a party that is largely responsible for much of the ethical framework that now governs Irish politics and for the change introduced some years ago relating to corporate donations and so forth, has been campaigning and committed to updating and modernising the framework in respect of how we fairly finance politics in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The rules we introduced about a decade ago succeeded in flushing big money corporate donations out of Irish politics to a real extent, but the bequest of cash and assets worth more than &pound;2 million from the late William Hampton to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and that party's acceptance of it exposed some of the frailties of our system and some of the anomalies that exist between both jurisdictions on this island.  It appears that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, agrees.  That was clearly outlined in correspondence it issued to the Labour Party in response to concerns we raised with it.  It seems that a party that is registered and active in both jurisdictions can accept limitless amounts of cash in the North regardless of the restrictions here.  I am not saying that as a criticism necessarily; I am saying it is a fact of life.  That is the reality and it is incumbent on us as legislators and on anybody who wishes to see a more transparent system of politics and the financing of politics on this island to call that out and to propose solutions to what is a real problem.  Frankly, I would not look to what I describe as the corrupt and amoral UK system of political financing to set a benchmark for the framework of ethics in politics in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments from the Minister of State reflect some of the reforms that I proposed in my Second Stage contribution on this Bill.  Little did I think that such extensive reforms would be proposed to be inserted into the legislation at this point, welcome as the amendments are in principle.  The way in which the Bill has been wholesale amended with the intention of shunting it very hastily into the select committee, as we will do from this afternoon, is no way to do business.  I hope the House will accept that.  As I said on the Order of Business last week, these reforms are critical to the proper functioning of politics and of our democracy.  The D&aacute;il should have been given ample time to interrogate the proposals from the Minister of State properly.  I accept we will do that on Committee Stage in the select committee and on Report Stage and that the process will be mirrored in the Seanad, but we should have been afforded the opportunity to have sight of the Minister of State's proposals on Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>  We also did not have ample opportunity to propose amendments to the Minister of State's amendments.  Two amendments have been circulated this afternoon.  One of them is from me and one is from the Minister of State.  That is an imperfect way of doing business late in the day.  Quite frankly, it is unsatisfactory and it can lead to the making of bad law and to unintended consequences.  Officials in the Department said at the very welcome briefing yesterday, which we all welcomed and found very useful, that many of the ideas reflected in the amendments came from the consultation that was undertaken with the political parties in 2021.  That was an important consultation.  However, if we are to accept that, surely we should accept that those changes should have been reflected in the initial Bill and not brought forward in such a hasty fashion.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time I have left I will speak to some of the amendments.  Bringing so-called subsidiary organisations into the ambit of the financing and donations sphere is very important, as is the requirement to declare all properties owned by political parties and subsidiary organisations and put them into the ambit of the system.  We know that most wealth in this country is held not in cash but in assets, such as land and property.  Where there are assets such as wealth in property there is wealth and that has to be recorded.  We must be very clear about who owns those properties and assets.  That is in the public interest.  It is important, too, that annual statutory declarations will have to be made by party leaders and that these will include all donations from subsidiary organisations from outside the State.  It is interesting that the Department confirmed in the briefing yesterday what I had suspected from my first reading of the relevant amendment, which is that this will not be governed by donation thresholds currently in place but instead it will apply to all donations in cash or coin from outside the State.  That is an interesting proposal and I expect we will have some detailed debate about it.  My understanding is that donations can still be made by citizens residing outside of the State in the normal way, once they are within the SIPO personal and corporate donations thresholds.<\/p>  <p>  It is also very welcome that official accounting standards in terms of the recording and presentation of accounts will be required if the Minister of State's amendments are accepted, and I expect many of them will be.  Again, this is very important for transparency and consistency.  It will mean that every party will know what its obligations are, what the reporting and accounting standards are and, significantly and critically, the general public will be able to compare and contrast the financial position of each registered party.  Nobody involved in politics in this country and nobody who is committed to democracy should fear transparency.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage later today and throughout the week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100018#S00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1654009800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>First, I welcome this Bill.  It is important legislation.  Establishing an electoral commission is long overdue.  It is an important measure, and the main thrust of the Bill is one I welcome.  As I outlined on Second Stage, I have a slightly different take on this from that of other parties.  While I welcome the legislation as very good, it is weak in some places and must be strengthened, especially in areas around voter education.  I have tabled amendments on that which we will discuss shortly on Committee Stage.  I hope the Government is able to accept some of those amendments.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the other Deputies about the importance of ensuring there is strong regulation of what happens online on social media during elections.  It is an area that is not sufficiently regulated, and the Bill does not do it sufficiently.  There has to be very strong transparency regulation and restrictions in that area.  It is certainly something on which I am happy to work with other Deputies and other parties.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the process in respect of the later amendments that have been introduced by the Government, I have no issue with being flexible and efficient in the legislative process but we must have a certain amount of time built in to allow for sufficient scrutiny.  To explain, we were given the briefing note from the Department on these new amendments when it was emailed to us at 12.05 p.m. today, approximately three and a half hours before this debate.  We have other things to do so it is not as if we can simply drop everything else and go straight to the briefing note and analyse it.  A group of these amendments are about more transparency in the electoral process, but we need more transparency in the legislative process, which means that if a briefing note is circulated about new amendments, and it a good idea to have a briefing note circulated, and it is received three and a half hours in advance, after only receiving the briefing yesterday, there is insufficient time to engage and to scrutinise properly.<\/p> <p>I raise those points not to be awkward but to be helpful.  We want to be able to scrutinise the legislation and the amendments as much as possible and we need an adequate amount of time to do so.  I hope that can be taken on board.<\/p> <p> I very much welcome the amendments on same-day island voting and I recognise the work done by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on that.  These are welcome measures.  They are long overdue and very important.  People on the islands have made the case strongly that they should not be treated any differently from anyone else, that there are not the same barriers to transport of ballot boxes as there might have been in the past and that, especially in the modern era, there can be very consequential developments in elections right up towards the end in respect of the national debate.  They feel they should not be put at any disadvantage when they cast their votes.  It is very important that the Government has taken that on board.<\/p> <p> As for the restrictions in not allowing donations through cryptocurrencies, given that that is not properly regulated and there is a lack of traceability, I support those measures.  It may be that at some point in the future, matters may be different and this may need to be changed but that makes sense at the moment.<\/p> <p> I very much welcome another long-overdue measure, that political donations accounts can be opened up in credit unions.  It is a small thing but it has been a source of a lot of frustration to people that they cannot go to credit unions to open such accounts.  This measure is important symbolically in recognising the very important role of credit unions, and there is no good reason it should not have been facilitated in the first place.<\/p> <p> I also  welcome the amendments on transparency regarding properties and ownership in respect of political parties.  I note the Government is not supporting my Bill on a land price register, which would give greater transparency on ownership of land, including development land, but at least we will have that transparency in respect of political parties, if no one else, in terms of land interests. If the Government votes down my land price register Bill, I will be back as quick as I possibly can with a revised Bill on that issue.<\/p> <p> Finally, people can look at this Bill and wonder whether these issues matter and whether they are technical.  They absolutely matter to the heart of our democracy.  Money can have an absolutely corrosive effect on democracy.  We have seen that, very sadly, with the recent events in Robb Elementary School, Uvalde, Texas, where children and their teachers were murdered in a society where there is an absolute lack of effective gun control as a direct result of the corrosive effect that money has in the US political system and that the US gun lobby has in lobbying the US political system.  That is at its most extreme the highly corrosive effect money can have on the political system.  We have seen the corrosive effect of money on politics in Ireland, especially its effect on our planning system, and we have in turn seen some detrimental effects of that.  We see in our planning system to this day developments happening without sufficient infrastructure, proper childcare places or schools going in as a direct result of changes made in our planning system due to lobbying and due to a lack of transparency in respect of the influence of lobbyists on our planning system.  These things have an effect on people's lives.  It is important to do as much as we can to make our system as transparent as possible.  That is why our measures have to go beyond the measures in this Bill in respect of the electoral system, welcome though they are.  They are one part of the equation and, on their own, not sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100018#S00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654010400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Deputy Mattie McGrath, I believe you are sharing with your colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100019#T00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1654010400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I am sharing with Deputy Michael Collins and possibly an Teachta Danny Healy-Rae if he arrives.<\/p>  <p>  I too welcome this long-overdue electoral reform.  In many areas the measures could be wider than what is proposed, but I understand that small steps are important.  I pay tribute to the many people I have worked with over the years in the county councils, South Tipperary County Council and then North Tipperary County Council, who helped out, did a lot of work and updated the register.  They were really in a void and a vacuum.  They did not have the proper information a lot of the time but they did their best with the limited resources they had.  The electoral register was, come election day, often in a bit of a mess.  Whole streets were knocked off it and there was anguish and so on.  I hope we can avoid that.<\/p>  <p>  I see there is to be a rolling aspect to when 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds can get involved and get on the register, if they are interested in doing so.  That is very important.  We hear debates and clamours for people to get the vote at 16, but we should at least get them involved.  I spoke to cara liom in the canteen just a few minutes ago.  I had her daughter visit here previously.  I worked with his parents some years ago.  The daughter has just turned 18.  I asked if she was registered.  It should not be beyond possible nowadays and in this modern era - although when we see what happened in Dublin Airport at the weekend, one would have to be left bewildered - that people when they get their PPS numbers are automatically put on a register when they are ocht mbliana d&eacute;ag d'aois.  They should be.  Why do we have to be so archaic and so slow?  I welcome the effective engagement with the 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds, but that should happen automatically.<\/p>  <p>  Then there are the death certificates.  It is awfully offensive to people to get post and to see many different issues with the electoral register when there is a death in the family.  There should be some link-ins with the death certificates.  This is 2022.  I do not know why this is so far back and so outdated.  As I said, however, we are making some progress, I hope.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is electoral reform around donations and so on.  Certainly, we had the wild west for decades, and we now have SIPO, which does a very good job.  The vast majority of people are engaged with it and comply 99.9%, and rightly so.

Many young people want the right to vote.  Maybe we have to look at implementing rules and regulations regarding people who do not vote but who have the right to vote.  Many people in this country, including my namesake, gave their life for that.  It is sad to think that many people could not care to take the journey down the road to vote on voting day.  I think a regulation in that regard has to be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Also, I am very worried, when it comes to electoral reform, about how the political system could be interfering, especially in boundaries and the reissuing of boundaries.  A number of years ago, in my constituency we lost part of Dunmanway and lost Enniskean, Castletown Kinneigh and Newcestown.  I will not go any further.  I could probably name many of the west Cork townlands but you might get annoyed with me, a Cheann Comhairle.  The people in those areas keep telling me they have no connection with the constituency they were put into.  These are west Cork towns, villages and areas, and these people cannot understand for the life of them why they were taken out and put into the north Cork, Macroom and Ballincollig area.  They keep coming to me.  I have no issue with that or with trying to help them, but it does not make any sense that they have no relation to their constituency.  Take the people of Enniskean.  Ballineen is almost the same town and it is split down the middle, so one area is in one constituency and Ballineen is in the Cork South-West constituency.  My worry is that this is to be looked at through new boundaries, electoral reform and all these commissions that are out there, but it is very strongly politically linked.  It looks to me sometimes that some of these are nice little movements.  The last seat might be picked up by a party that has seen its stance weakened in political society.  We need to find out who in the name of God is on these committees and why the work is not being carried out by an independent commission.<\/p>  <p>  As for the electoral register, I myself was a registrar years ago, and God knows they used to do a good job when there were the people on the ground carrying it out.

A bit of common sense must be applied here.  I know that in schools they have the dates of birth of students, and they know their ages.  At this stage, young people should be automatically put on the register when they reach 18 years of age.  Instead, we find that so many of them are not on it when we go around one or two weeks before an election.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  Given all the information the authorities have, including PPS numbers and the whereabouts of people, as well as the census, in the era in which we live there should be some way for automatic registration.  When people move, they are taken off the register in the area where they lived - whoever is good enough to do that - but they have no vote in the new area.  Although they are taken off automatically, they are not put on automatically.  We find ourselves with an awful lot of work to do.  It is my belief that nobody should be taken off the register unless they are put on it somewhere else.  I know the political parties have done this in the past.  They take people off, but they do not look to put them on where they go.  This is something on which we should all work together to ensure that every youngster and person who is in an area has an entitlement to vote, whoever they vote for.  I hope they vote for me when my name is on the ballot paper, but they should surely vote for someone.

I support the Government's intention to provide for same-day voting on islands in elections and referendums.  This would affect many island voters in my constituency of Donegal who have been advocating for same-day voting for a long time.  There is no reason why island voters should be forced to vote in advance.  It is important that every voter is allowed access to all information on upcoming elections and referendums.  This includes making sure that everyone has the ability to watch late debates and follow changing stories before casting their votes.  Island voters should not be treated any differently to the rest of the country and I am pleased to see that the intention is that they will not be any longer.  We must ensure that happens.  Same-day voting is more than doable for all the islands at this stage with modern communication methods.<\/p>  <p>  I also support the Government's intention to amend the Electoral Act 1997.  This is long overdue.  I am pleased that we are finally addressing areas in this Act that require amendment.  I specifically support the amendment of section 22 of the Electoral Act.  I hope the Government will take on board the amendments that have been put forward regarding the term \"political purposes\".  The inclusion of this term has created very unfortunate unforeseen consequences.  I was very disappointed to see that this was not addressed in the drafting of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022.  I urge the Government to accept the proposed amendments to address the issue.<\/p>  <p>  A very important aspect of modern, democratic societies is ensuring that civil society has a voice and plays an important role in policymaking.  To take way this role would be incredibly undemocratic and would only serve to weaken legislation in this country.  However, as the law currently defines it, \"political purposes\" actually encompasses human rights and social justice work.  Shockingly, the inclusion of this definition in the Electoral Act 1997 has placed a ban on any group of citizens raising money to campaign for a particular policy or to criticise the activities of the Government.  Groups now run the risk of facing serious financial penalties and possible imprisonment for speaking out on the very issues most of them have first-hand experience of dealing with.<\/p>  <p>  Advocacy groups receiving donations and working on the ground should be able to speak out, advise and criticise Government policies.  Furthermore, we should be actively seeking to include these voices.  Most often, these are the groups that are seeing and experiencing the issues at first hand, and they have played an incredibly important role in influencing policy in this country.  We should be capable of including a definition that differentiates between community and advocacy groups and groups with private sector influence.  Obviously, the intent behind the legislation in the first place was to curb the corporate lobbyists.  It should be possible to do that without curbing community groups as well.  The Electoral Act seriously compromises Ireland's democratic values in disallowing advocacy groups from undertaking this role.  Advocacy must be supported at all costs.  We must do all we can to protect the rights of groups to continue their work.  Accordingly, I sincerely hope that this particular amendment is accepted.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, I support this motion.  However, I hope that the committee's input and the many Opposition amendments put forward are equally supported by the Government as this legislation passes through all Stages.  It is important that while we facilitate things happening in this House, the Government should be capable of facilitating work in the committee and taking on board amendments that have value put forward by the Opposition as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100020#U00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1654011000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle as an deis teacht ar ais.  I wish to address a couple of issues I believe are important in this debate.  We do have a wonderful electoral system in this State.  The PR-STV system does provide for very clear representation within the political institutions, which is very important.  When we have a system whereby various minority voices are excluded for whatever reason, that leads to real difficulties within the political system.  First, those minority voices are very important, and it is important that they have an influence over the direction of the country.  We can learn a lot from those minority voices.  Also, if minority voices are continuously blocked and they feel they do not have a democratic opportunity to get their point across, that can lead to frustration within a democracy and to negative outcomes as well.  It is important that we try to maintain, as much as possible, the best representation within the democracy that we have.<\/p>  <p>  In other countries, such as the United States and Britain, we see that when the representation element is not built within the system it can lead to significant difficulties.  In the United States, if a person is not voting for Trump or Biden, he or she literally does not have another option in the system there.  That is part of the polarising element that can be found sometimes in the United States.  It is the same in Britain.  Voters do not have another option because the first-past-the-post system militates against a third or fourth option ever becoming available to people, so they are forced into those two poles, in terms of political choices.  I ask the Minister of State to focus on this, if he can, to make sure that in this country we have the most representative political system.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that six-seat constituencies are available to the Minister and the commission under the Constitution, yet we have not seen such constituencies used in this State for probably well over 50 years.  When I spoke to a Minister of State recently, I suggested that the country is full of three-seat constituencies, which militate against proper representation, and that we should be moving to six-seat constituencies.  The Minister of State said the big parties would not like that.  Therein lies one of the difficulties that we have in this entire process.  It should not be about what the big parties want in the design of our electoral system.  It should be about ensuring that we have the clearest representation possible from the electorate into the number of men and women sitting in this Chamber.  That is why I would advise the Minister of State to consider six-seat constituencies.  When I look at County Meath, for example, it has six Deputies, but it delivers them through two three-seat constituencies.  That could result in a major difficulty because it ensures that sections of the political views of the people of the county are simply never going to be represented in here.<\/p>  <p>  The other element I would like the Minister of State to focus on is the slivers of counties that find themselves in constituencies outside of those counties.  Again, in County Meath, we have a sliver of Westmeath, around the Castlepollard to Delvin area, which is part of Meath West and a sliver of the eastern part of the county in the Louth constituency.  What happens often times with these types of slivers is that they fall between two stools.<\/p> <p>They do not have an electorate large enough to elect a Deputy and, therefore, Deputies in general start to focus their attention on where the electorate population is.  For many years, that part of Westmeath did not have a Deputy's constituency office.  It now has two, thankfully, as Aont&uacute; and Sinn F&eacute;in both have offices in that constituency.  It is important we try our damnedest to make sure those slivers do not happen because on a county council basis, a political basis and even in the mindset of the people who live in the area, people are aligned to counties.  When 6,000 or 7,000 people are appended to another constituency, they often do not get the representation they are entitled to and that is a mistake.<\/p> <p> I am reminded of a scene in \"Killinaskully\", where a lady who looks about 90 years old tells a local politician he can be assured of her vote and adds that he can be assured of her mammy's vote as well.  The politician thanks her and inquires how long her mammy has been dead at this stage.  A constituent in my county had voting cards sent to him from the age of two.  I know numerous people to whom voting cards are sent in a half-dozen locations.  It makes a mockery of the register and allows for electoral fraud.  When we start to talk about the issue of voter turnout, we are actually talking about voter turnout in the context of a hocus-pocus register.  We are not getting the actual turnout in respect of the number of citizens in a constituency who can vote.<\/p> <p> The Minister has an opportunity to resolve some of these issues.  I ask him to be bold and courageous, to step outside the actions taken over the past 20 to 40 years, to build in six-seater constituencies where they would fit within county lines and where they would give far more representation to citizens, and then make sure the integrity of counties is protected in future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100020#U00400","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654011600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100021#V00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1654011600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I was looking ahead at statements on transport where the Government is allowed to reply, but in this instance it is not.

I will not be here for the entire debate.  There is a Cabinet meeting at the same time, which is unfortunate, but I look forward to reading the record and hearing what Members have to say on how we use this moment in time to deliver a seismic change in the nature, characteristics and environmental aspects of our transport system.  The switch to this new sustainable mobility mode will be key to this.  The national sustainable mobility policy, published last month, sets out the approach we need to take.  I will give some examples of what is happening and talk about some of the structures we need to put in place.<\/p>  <p>  I will start with the imperative for doing this.  It is an imperative driven first and foremost by our climate targets.  We have to halve our emissions in this decade and we expect transport to have to provide a reduction close to the average we want to see across the economy.  That will not be easy.  It will be incredibly challenging because many of the patterns that have been put in place are there because for five decades or more, we followed a transport policy that was about promoting private car use, which saw ever-longer commuting distances and ever-longer amounts of time spent commuting.  The last census showed approximately 200,000 of our citizens commute for more than an hour each way every day.  Of those, approximately 80,000 have children under 15 and about 45,000 of them have children who are in their preschool years.  This means there are millions of hours when people are not spending time with their families, and when there is major frustration with the traffic gridlock caused by this system that has been created, not to mention the emissions that come from it.<\/p>  <p>  This system has also promoted an ever-lengthening sprawl, especially from our cities.  If we look at the census populations for distance travelled for work, we see this doughnut pattern around each of our five cities, in particular, where people moved out and commuted ever-longer distances.  As I said, it did not work in climate terms and it did not work in the time wasted by people they could have otherwise spent in a range of other much more preferable activities.  It was also very expensive in resource terms and having to provide the infrastructure for it.<\/p>  <p>  We now need to change and change everything.  There are four legs to the stool on which we will build a new transport system.  These relate to switching, including switching away from the use of fossil fuels, which we know we have to do, towards using electricity, biofuels, hydrogen and other transport fuels that will meet our needs.  We need to make a modal shift away from overdependence on the private car.  We need to start with our younger people, where there has been a remarkable change in the past 30 to 40 years.  We have gone from a country where the vast majority of young children took the bus, walked or cycled to school, to the current environment where the vast majority are driven to school.  Indeed, one of the statistics that jumps out, for example, is more secondary school girls drive themselves to school than cycle to school.  How did we create such an environment?  We need to change it.  We need that modal shift back to active travel, walking, cycling and taking the bus and train.<\/p>  <p>  We need to shorten the overall amount of travel.  We need to implement the national planning framework, which references not just decarbonising but supporting more compact development and better balanced regional development so everything is not built on the east coast and there is not ever-increasing growth in the numbers travelling in Dublin.  That is not just bad for the rest of the country.  In the end, it is bad for Dublin because it will not be able to cope with the volume of traffic coming in and out of it.<\/p>  <p>  The fourth S in this switch, shift and shorten approach to sustainable mobility has to be towards sharing.  There is a significant opportunity for us to develop sharing transport modes, recognising that most cars spend almost 92% of the day parked and not being used.  A sharing mode, in this time of a cost-of-living crisis, is an obvious way we can reduce the economic burden on our householders, while still providing the mobility they need without them necessarily being obliged to own every car, in addition to being flexible in how they share services to deliver that mobility.<\/p>  <p>  I will give some examples of what is happening in government and what we are delivering on in four key aspects, in particular, active travel because promoting it is the most important strategic development we seek to achieve.  I will outline what is happening in bus transport, how we do demand management to help us make this more sustainable shift, and some of the governance structures we are setting up in the Government to achieve this leap to halving our climate emissions, reducing the amount of travel we have to do and seeing a shift and a switch in the fuels we use.<\/p>  <p>  Recent developments in active travel are significant.  A walking and cycling index was published two weeks ago, for which a very detailed survey was done of Irish householders, some 71% of whom, as citizens, said they wanted to see more investment in cycling and walking infrastructure, such as greenways, cycle tracks and better footpaths.  That is one of the reasons the Government has committed to provide more than &euro;360 million a year for them in its programme for Government, as well as in reality.<\/p> <p> We followed the OECD recommendation of spending 20% of the transport capital budget on active travel, so we are following best international advice.  We are starting to see it pay dividends.  The Clontarf cycleway, which is being built at the moment, shows a new level of priority for cyclists and pedestrians as well as buses.  This is what we need to do.  MacCurtain Street in Cork is an example of how a busy city centre street can be changed.  That will happen this year.  We need to do the same for O'Connell Street in Limerick city.  These are just examples of projects that are starting to be delivered.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know that the incredibly narrow Salmon Weir Bridge is a pinch point between the city, the university and the hospital.  We are starting to provide new facilities there.  This is only the start of what we need to do.  Another example of what is happening on the ground is the extension of the greenway in Waterford from Bilberry into the city.<\/p> <p> Projects are not just happening in our cities.  Some 1,200 walking and cycling projects are being undertaken by local authorities across the country.  One I am looking forward to is the new bridge across the Shannon in Athlone as part of the greenway from Dublin to Galway.  The bridge will transform the stunning and beautiful urban space on the western side of the Shannon in Athlone town.  It will open that area up, provide for significant rejuvenation and create a public place, while also providing active travel infrastructure.  Other projects include the Hanover residential and cycling scheme in Carlow and the N63 cycling and pedestrian scheme in Longford.  I could go on.  People around the country know that we are only starting &ndash; we still have a great deal to learn &ndash; to roll out these projects, which will be critical in transforming how we view walking and cycling in our cities and will reverse the pattern that has developed over the past 40 years.  When I went to school, the majority of people walked, cycled or took the bus.  Today, the vast majority are driven there.  We can turn that around.  There are 170 schools involved in the first green school projects to improve facilities and infrastructure.<\/p> <p> I will speak to governance later, but at this critical point, as we come out of Covid and when patterns are still flexible and changing, we need to go further and provide spaces across the country that make our villages, towns, countryside and cities safe, accessible and pleasant places to walk and cycle.  The benefits of this lie not just in the climate, but in a much more efficient transport system and a healthier population.  The health benefits of active travel are beyond compare.<\/p> <p> This is also a social justice project.  When I was a councillor in Dublin city, almost half of all households did not own a car - many of them could not afford one - but they suffered the worst noise and air pollution and congestion problems because of a traffic system that did not serve them.  We were not providing for households that did not have a car.  What were we doing?  We are now providing for them.  It is a more economical, healthier, cleaner, safer and much better system.<\/p> <p> We need to do the same for bus infrastructure as we are for active travel projects.  We are doing so.  Last week, the third of the BusConnects routes in Dublin was launched.  It is going before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Routes are starting to be put in on the Howth, Lucan and other corridors.  We are starting to reform the whole route network as well as street formation to give further priority to buses.<\/p> <p> This is not just happening in Dublin.  Last month, the sustainable transport corridors report on Cork was published by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Cork city and county councils.  It will go back for public consultation in the coming months.  I believe 12 corridors are being planned there.  There will be a combination of cycling and walking in Cork, with 54 km more of walking and cycling routes as well as 75 km in new bus routes.  The same is happening in Galway.  It is critical that we develop high-quality bus corridors there, with the prospect of shaping the city around public transport rather than around roads, which I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will welcome.  We could then examine the retrofitting of those bus corridors with light rail.<\/p> <p> This is the step change that we can make, but it starts with giving priority to bus services in Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Cork and Dublin.  It is happening, but it needs to be accelerated, which I will address in my closing comments regarding the governance system.<\/p> <p> The BusConnects networks in our cities are important, but the most important bus project is probably Connecting Ireland, through which we are trying to establish new rural bus transport routes.  If we deliver on this scheme, approximately 100 towns and villages will see frequent and proper public bus services for the first time.  We started last year with some experimental schemes in Dingle and Leitrim.  Now, we are starting to expand it.  We will expand it first to the Ukrainian people who have come to our country in order to give them access to public transport services, for example, in north Clare.  However, this is a five-year project.  Each year, new and clever loop services will be rolled out that connect to train stations and other transport infrastructure, so that synergy is created and every part of the country can start to see public transport as part of its transport system.<\/p> <p> This project will be key and we will have to deliver it in a time of change when the patterns that were in place before Covid are unlikely to return.  This will require us to consider whether all of our buses are in the right locations, whether we need the level of commuting services that were provided previously, whether we need to match the new transport patterns that will develop with people working remotely and whether we need new town services, for example, those that we introduced recently in Kilkenny, Athlone and elsewhere.  This is the type of review of our public transport system that needs to be done to help adjust to the changing patterns as we come out of Covid.<\/p> <p> Something else that the Government has done as regards our bus system is provide a 20% reduction in all public transport fares to the end of the year as a way of encouraging people back onto public transport as we come out of Covid.  For under-24s, we have provided a 50% reduction in fares to ensure that the pattern is set early in life.  We will have to continue reviewing, monitoring and measuring how the public transport system is being used in this new post-Covid, heading-towards-decarbonised world to ensure that it fits patterns of transport that are changing radically from what they were previously.<\/p> <p> Besides active travel and bus travel, a third aspect is demand management.  Public transport fare changes will help us to switch away from private car ownership.  It is not that private car owners are wrong or bad people.  Rather, it does not work mathematically.  It is expensive and creates congestion, which ends up costing everyone and creating high emissions.<\/p> <p> As well as lower fares, we are examining the five cities demand management study, which was published this year and will play a critical part in the changes we need to make.  We need to reallocate space to support more sustainable transport solutions.  We need to examine our car parking patterns to see whether they are promoting sustainable urban and rural design systems or whether we need to regulate some car parking systems so that the space can be used to create better local environments and streetscapes and support retailers without having everyone drive to every shopfront before driving off and leaving our streets less attractive, less safe, less efficient and less effective as an urban public realm.<\/p> <p> Turning to governance, we have the right plans in place to deliver this switch.  We have the national development plan, which commits &euro;35 billion to transport over the next eight years.  We have the climate action plan, which is strong and legally effective in steering in the direction of a more sustainable low-carbon system.<\/p> <p>We have the national planning framework and the national sustainable mobility policy.  In its remaining two and three quarter years in office, this Government is committed to focusing on delivery and making sure we bring real, efficient, effective and quick change about because we have to be fast before transport patterns are set again as we come out of the Covid period.<\/p> <p> It is also critical that in the next three years we meet our carbon budget for 2025, which will probably be one of the most difficult things to do in transport.  We have established a leadership group within the Government and a delivery team beneath it that involves various Departments and Government agencies like the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, bringing in outside expertise and new thinking and sharing it through our national climate dialogue so that stakeholders across the country can recommend ideas, see what is happening and understand what is in the programme.  Those leadership groups also include the regional authorities and the County and City Managers Association.  Critically, we will go to each local authority and ask it to put forward some pathfinder projects, as we are calling them, that can be delivered in the next three years and that might be done super-fast.  I will use the example of Robert Burns in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and some of the coastal cycle routes that were developed using low-cost solutions and by working with communities to get agreement on what is difficult.  As we all know, space reallocation to support cycling, walking or bus transport is not easy but that is what we have to do.  We must use this opportunity with the space that was previously used for mass commuting, which will not return.  If we do not do so, we will fail both to meet our climate targets for the next three years and to move the entire country in a more sustainable direction.<\/p> <p> I hope that in each city and county, local authority managers will join in this process, which has to be from the bottom up.  It cannot be directed from the top down because it has to be wanted.  The type of project we might look at in, for example, Limerick would involve the three universities joining together in the context of the development of a bus, cycle and walking network that would transform the city centre, bring life back into it and connect those universities.  This could be done at a relatively low cost.  We could also reopen the Foynes train line.  One of the Deputies suggested to the T&aacute;naiste last week that the latter could be done quickly as a way to encourage people to move away from driving to industrial estates and getting stuck.  We could go from a system that is not working to fast-tracking the rail solution there to serve our industrial sites better and to provide access to Adare in time for the Ryder Cup.  We want to deliver those sort of accelerated projects.<\/p> <p> I mention Galway city and what we should do there to turn matters around.  I hate to say this, and I have discussed it with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle before, but Galway probably has the least effective transport system of our five major cities.  What could we do in three years or what targets could we set ourselves?  I visited Galway the week before last and asked the local authority and the local chamber of commerce to come back with proposals for BusConnects, cycling and greenway projects that we could deliver in the next three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100021#V00700","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654012800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I will be accused of not being fair if I let the Minister go on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100023#X00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1654012800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I will finish on the following point: we want the councils of the country to come to this leadership group with proposals for these pathfinder projects that we could deliver quickly and at low cost as part of this sustainable mobility revolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100023#X00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1654012800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>These statements have been flagged since last week after the meeting of the Business Committee and the working title was \"Statements on Transport\" up until 6.30 p.m. yesterday.

He is the Minister for Transport.  The people of Ireland are looking to the Minister and his Department for leadership on this matter.  The Minister can take it or leave it, but my opinion is that to neglect that, not reference it and not provide confidence and comfort to people who either went through the experience of Dublin Airport at the weekend or who will be travelling next weekend or further into the future, is incredible.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the matter of transport.  While there are many areas I could focus on, the events of the weekend put one matter ahead of all others.  As an island nation, air connectivity is vital for family, social, tourism and business purposes.  The aviation sector has endured two difficult years during the pandemic with many workers losing their jobs and thousands of others suffering severe pay cuts.  A rapid return to normality was hoped for and thankfully that is now materialising.  Unfortunately, our main State airport failed to read the signs of recovery over the past year and was completely ill-prepared for the long-awaited rebound.<\/p><p>During the pandemic, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, slashed employee numbers.  It cut 1,000 staff.  That was completely excessive, short-sighted and highlighted a total disregard for workers.  It was also incredibly ill-judged for an authority with responsibility in the aviation sector.  The DAA is now scrambling to refill these jobs, which should not have been abolished in the first place.  In short, abolishing them was a penny-wise-and-pound-foolish approach.  If the DAA had talked to a sinner soul on this island during the pandemic, it would have known that people were chomping at the bit to get back to travel.  In addition, Ireland is home to Ryanair, one of the most successful and aggressive airlines on the planet.  As a result, the airport should have been better prepared for a more rapid aviation recovery compared with other airports.  If aviation was going to recover anywhere, it was going to recover in Ireland.  Instead, the DAA was caught on the hop and passengers have paid the price.<\/p><p>Dublin Airport management is simply not performing, and that is not just when it comes to unacceptable security wait times.  Complaints have been made about the uncleanliness of the airport, long queues for food and beverage outlets in the terminals, more delays for baggage pick-up and the struggle to get taxis.  We even saw an ugly brawl in the terminal recently.  The Garda response to the incident was slow, despite the opening of a brand-new Garda station in the airport this month.  It all adds up to an unpleasant experience for passengers, with many dreading the thought of using the airport to go to and from Ireland.<\/p><p>It is having an incredibly negative impact on our international reputation.  We spend millions each year marketing Ireland as a great tourist destination but coverage of this travel chaos on the BBC, in <i>The New York Times<\/i>and on Australian news has the potential to put tourists off.  Cost-cutting by management and neglect by Government Ministers has resulted in a significant drop in the quality of the service being offered at Dublin Airport, and that is not good enough.  Is the Minister for Transport happy to stand idly by and allow these problems to continue or has he any intention of acting?  Throughout the pandemic I raised the need for support for the aviation sector so that it could be ready for this rebound.  Airports and airlines used the pandemic as an opportunity to cut staff numbers beyond what was justified.  They targeted the longest-serving, most experienced and best-paid staff.<\/p><p>I raised the issue of security delays with the Minister at the start of April when the problem arose ahead of the Easter break.  I asked him what action he was taking to address this problem.  The Minister said he was monitoring the situation and was arranging meetings with the management of the airport.  The same response came yesterday when yet another meeting took place with management.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, have stated that they will now hold daily meetings with management about this problem.<\/p> <p>Meetings are all we have had.  That is it.  What have these meetings achieved to date and what is discussed at them?  By the look of things, it is not solutions.<\/p> <p> The Government has a really important role to play in this matter.  We are talking about the busiest State airport in the country, with 85% of all air traffic going through it.  There are solutions the Government can push to help to fix this issue.  First, excellent pay and working conditions are central to resolving it.  There have been reports about low pay, long shifts and issues with workers getting paid their overtime.  Good pay and conditions will help to attract and retain security staff in our airports.  In the short term, extra personnel clearly need to be drafted into Dublin Airport, whether from other airports or, for example, by utilising Army personnel.  Everything needs to be on the table.  We also need to see a fast-tracking of recruitment and training for new staff.<\/p> <p> In the medium term, as well as investment in workers, we need to see investment in new security screening equipment.  Last year, Shannon Airport invested in upgrading its security machines, which removes the need to take liquids and laptops out of bags.  This has the potential to speed things up significantly.  In the longer term, we need a plan to rebalance some of the Dublin Airport traffic to other airports, including Cork, Shannon and Ireland West Airport Knock.  As I said, 85% of traffic currently goes through Dublin.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Transport cannot wash his hands of this problem.  All Ministers needs to step up and take responsibility.  They cannot just turn up at the airport when a ribbon needs cutting.  When the pressure is on, they need to stand up and be counted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100023#X01200","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654013400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Over the weekend, we witnessed shocking sights at Dublin Airport arising from issues with capacity.  There was chaos, with more than 1,000 people missing flights, many of them unable to depart for holidays they had waited three years to go on and others delayed in visiting family or leaving for work opportunities.  Some of those people will not get the time off work at a later date to take another holiday.  For many of them, this was their one opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the Government support it received during the Covid crisis, through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the DAA laid off 1,000 staff in order to reduce any losses during the pandemic.  The company saw an opportunity to get rid of workers who had the best terms and conditions and who were the longest working there.  This was about profit and greed.  That is why we ended up where we did at the weekend.  The DAA tried to maximise its profits on the backs of its workers, and the people of Ireland paid for that this weekend.  We made a show of ourselves.  In fact, the DAA made a show of the country.  Nowhere else would such a company's management be allowed to behave as the DAA's did.  In so doing, it made a joke of us as a nation.  For the Minister to come in here to today and indicate the company will be let away with it, instead of standing up and giving a stinging criticism of it, is unbelievable.<\/p>  <p>  There is another perspective to consider, which relates to my constituency of Cork North-Central.  If I walk into Dublin Airport today, I will see there are 178 flights to 88 separate destinations.  If I go into Cork Airport, however, there are only 26 flights to 11 destinations.  The Government has talked about balanced regional development and putting Cork forward as an alternative to Dublin for proper regional development.  The Minister and other Ministers have said they care about regional airports.  However, the facts are the facts.  They have not delivered and they do not care about regional airports.  The DAA and the Government care about only one thing, which is jamming every passenger into Dublin Airport.  We need to think outside the box now.  We have regional airports that are crying out of support.  Will the Minister finally deliver that support, work towards balanced development and ensure what we saw at the weekend will never happen again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100024#Y00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1654013400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I raise a long-running issue in my constituency of Louth, which includes parts of east Meath.  I refer to the need to extend the short hop zone to Laytown and Drogheda.  I have raised this issue on many occasions with the NTA at meetings I requested, at committee meetings and in representations to the authority.  To be honest, I have been met with a brick wall.  This is a pity because the extension really is a no-brainer.<\/p>  <p>  A monthly rail ticket to Dublin from Laytown costs &euro;237.  A monthly ticket from Balbriggan to Dublin costs &euro;154.  Laytown is the next stop after Balbriggan and the rail distance between the two stations is a mere 9 km.  The villages of east Meath, including Laytown, Bettystown and Donacarney, as well as Drogheda, have experienced a major expansion in their populations over the past decade or so.  A huge percentage of those people commute to Dublin every day.  There is a major burden on them, which they have been talking about for years.  Clearly, the NTA is not listening, which is why I am raising the issue with the Minister today.<\/p>  <p>  There is a total inequity in price fare structures, which penalises people using Drogheda and Laytown stations.  Commuters are resorting to driving their cars to Balbriggan to avail of the short hop zone fares.  From an environmental point of view, this is absolutely bonkers, as I am sure the Minister will agree.  He is leader of the Green Party and Minister for Transport.  He is aware of this issue.  His policies are encouraging people to drive part of the way to work because they cannot afford public transport.  These are the policies he is putting forward and that people must live with, day in and day out.  These are the policies coming from a Green Party Minister for Transport.<\/p>  <p>  Witnesses from the NTA made it clear to the transport committee several weeks ago that they are not even looking at fare reductions.  We have seen of late that the Minister can reduce fares with the stroke of a pen.  People in Laytown and the whole east Meath area, along with Drogheda, have been asking for more than a decade for an extension of the short hop zone to include them.  As a basic principle, public transport should be affordable and accessible.  Given the NTA's reluctance to ensure this is the case, it is clear the Government is the only entity that is able to do it.  There is an environmental and economic case to reduce the fares.  It is up to the Minister now to act.  He gave a fine opening statement in which he talked about super-fast and sustainable travel and encouraging people to use public transport.  As I was listening, I was waiting for him to acknowledge the situation I am raising and to tell me he is going to address it straight away, because it is bonkers.  The policies that are in place under his watch are giving people no option other than to drive part of their journey to work in order to avail of the short hop zone fare up the road.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister continue talking the talk or is he going to walk the walk?  Will he give a commitment to take action, particularly in view of all the reasons I have outlined and given that it is a no-brainer from an economic and environmental point of view?  Will he listen and will he act?  He talked about speedy action.  Is he going to address this issue or will he, like the NTA, turn a  blind eye to it?  Will he extend the short hop zone?  People want to travel by train.  The Minister is talking about encouraging the use of public transport seven days a week.  Will he make it more affordable and accessible for the people I am talking about to do precisely that by extending the short hop zone, or is he just going to ignore the issue?

We are talking about sustainable transport.  We are talking about the airport.  This crisis has been multifactorial and has been years in the making.  It will require a turning point as to where the airport is going and this should be it.  It needs to become a good employer again.  It needs to become an employer that will hire staff on good wages and good terms and conditions.  Staff should again be proud to work there.<\/p>  <p>  The airport is now asking the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, for an increase in airport charges to fund its development plans which have sustainable transport elements to them.  It wants to build solar farms to help out with the airport.  It wants to move to become properly carbon neutral.  It wants the metro to be linked up, as we all do.  It wants to reduce the number of cars using the airport.  It wants more public transport using the airport.  It wants to make all these changes.  How can it with any credibility come to the Minister, any future Minister or the CAR and say, \"We need more money.  Give us your money.  It will be in safe hands with us.  We know what to do with it.\"?  Its credibility has been absolutely shot.<\/p>  <p>  It is a massive problem because we need an airport that functions.  Air travel will be here to stay.  We are an island nation; we need air travel.  Air travel and aviation need to play their role on the climate agenda.  This has always been a charge against the Minister.  He is a Green Party member.  His credentials on climate issues are unquestionable.  However, there is a sense that he does not want to get involved in the airport because it conflicts with that.  That is the sense that is out there.  He needs to lead on this.  Privately he needs to drive what needs to be done in aviation.<\/p>  <p>  The lever of the pandemic was pulled very quickly cutting many staff from good secure employment, to be replaced, as the Minister is being replaced now, with other staff who are not on the same pay or terms and conditions which is outrageous.  Trade unions and those of us on the left warned about this for years and it has happened.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise some other issues while I have the floor.  Nationwide transport fare reduction has generally been a good thing, but it has been unequally applied.  I raise an issue highlighted to us by activists in Labour Youth and other activists in Wexford and the south-east region.  Young people travelling to college or work from Wexford, Wicklow and Kildare have been excluded from the fare reduction.  The reduction has not applied to Expressway or Wexford Bus and unfortunately many students and low-paid workers use these services to get to college or their workplace, be it in the capital or their surrounds.  They feel disenfranchised and excluded from this.  The Government has trumpeted this as a massively good thing.  It is good for those to whom it applies, but it does not apply equally and those outside Dublin and in rural areas are suffering.<\/p>  <p>  The 90-minute journey Leap card fare is also a good thing but some wrinkles need to be ironed out on a regional basis.  In north County Dublin, rail services to and from Balbriggan and Skerries are excluded even though Rush and Lusk and Donabate, which are not on the DART line but on the commuter line, are included.  As they are within the 90 minutes, it seems a line has been drawn in an arbitrary fashion.  This could be easily resolved.  Common sense demands that it would be resolved.  Those in the outer Dublin area, in Fingal, South County Dublin or the west should be included in the 90-minute fare because they can take 90-minute journeys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100025#Z01200","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1654014000,"counter":168,"content":"<p>When we have debates, they need to deal with the issues of the day.  The burning issue for the public at the moment is that of the delays at Dublin Airport.  For future reference, it is critical that any Minister coming in would address many other issues but would also address the issues of the day.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has had to leave the Chamber, but I have no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will convey this back to him.<\/p>  <p>  Aviation needs to be front and centre.  The Minister is meeting representatives of the DAA and they will also appear before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow.  We need to see a plan from the DAA as to how it will ensure that passengers can get through Dublin Airport on time before the upcoming bank holiday weekend when the numbers will double from 50,000 to 100,000 passengers per day into the summer period.<\/p>  <p>  We need to understand how this situation arose last weekend.  Was it simply rostering?  I accept there is a mismatch with the staff levels being at 70% of what they were in 2019 and traffic volumes at 90% or 95%.  Ultimately what happened over the weekend is down to management.  The security check workers are under extreme pressure.  I regret if passengers took their frustration out on the staff who are checking bags.  That should not happen and I regret if it did happen because there are reports that it did.<\/p>  <p>  The public are entitled to a service from the DAA.  We look forward to hearing from its representatives at the committee tomorrow.  We need to know when its plan which is due to go to Government tomorrow will be published so that we can discuss it in depth.<\/p>  <p>  The burning issue is obviously Dublin Airport.  I am a Deputy from the mid-west and Limerick.  The national aviation policy was published in 2015.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications published a report in December 2020 calling for that to be reviewed.  We now need to look at our overall policy for the distribution of airline traffic outside Dublin.  Dublin Airport is creaking at the seams.  Shannon Airport has a capacity to handle 4.5 million passengers per year.  It peaked at about 1.7 million.  It could take an extra 2 million passengers.<\/p>  <p>  No doubt the same is true for Cork, Knock and other airports.  That review needs to be commenced immediately.  We need to look at the redistribution of air traffic to places like Shannon and Cork.  Passengers can pass through Shannon in 20 minutes.  It now has state-of-the-art scanning equipment.  Passengers travelling to the US need only have their baggage scanned once whereas through Dublin it can be twice.  Passengers can also avail of pre-clearance there.  Cork is also a great airport.  We are a small island nation and need to think outside the box.  The Netherlands has a policy in place to redistribute traffic to other airports in the country to take pressure off Schiphol Airport.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>We need to do likewise.<\/p> <p> I will move on to deal with other issues.  The Limerick Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS, is currently out to public consultation.  There are many good things in it, including the intention to link Shannon Airport to Limerick city by rail.  There is a short-term proposal for a bus service from Shannon Airport to link in with the existing rail line at Cratloe and Sixmilebridge.  That plan uses the existing rail network.  That is something I pushed at a public consultation meeting to consider the first draft of LSMATS.  We need to see targets for the roll-out of bicycle lanes and so forth.  The Minister intervened to issue a directive to the National Transport Authority, NTA, which is the professional body charged with considering this particular transport strategy for Limerick, and told it not to proceed with stage 2.  That was an inappropriate intervention on the part of the Minister.  I ask him to reconsider.  We are looking for sustainable travel.  Limerick has serious traffic problems.  The northern distributor road was there for that purpose.  The first phase, which was from Coonagh to Knockalisheen, has a bus lane and cycle lanes.  We need phase 2 to Castletroy.  There are also serious traffic problems in Corbally.<\/p> <p> I also ask that the 20% reduction in public transport fares be extended beyond 2022.  I would like to see it extended into 2023.  It is a proactive measure and I would welcome its extension.  We need public transport, road, rail, cycle lanes and buses working in harmony to ensure we have a better sustainable transport system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100025#Z01300","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654014600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Unlike others who have spoken before me, I will speak to the topic, which is the sustainable mobility policy.  At the outset, I welcome the proposal from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to establish and accelerate pathfinder projects.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak with respect to my own city and constituency of Limerick and the mid-west region.  Before and since entering government, the Minister, I and the Green Party have persuaded many stakeholders of the vision for Limerick and the mid-west of a growing, thriving, sustainable, European region that will not only provide employment opportunities for those who come from the region but which will also provide opportunities for employment, a high-quality life and quality jobs to people from across Europe and the world.  We want them to come to Limerick and the mid-west to live an enjoyable, healthy and rewarding life.<\/p>  <p>  This vision we sold to the people of the mid-west is underpinned by the national development plan.  To achieve it, we must get planning and development right.  We cannot cherry-pick from this plan.  We must aggressively pursue it.  Limerick will grow and the question is how that will happen, how much will it grow and how quickly.  The path to fastest and best growth is to plan future development around the four rail lines that intersect at Limerick city.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about transit-oriented development, which is the idea that large medium- to high-density residential, commercial and employment projects should be built on a small footprint on or near a transport node such as a train station.  It is imperative that we not only provide high density but we also provide high-quality developments where people want to live.  The Limerick plan is to develop a network of new stations at Ballysimon, Parkway shopping centre, Moyross, Lisnagry, Patrickswell, Adare and so on.  Raheen industrial estate, for example, has 6,000 workers.  I have spoken with the leaders of various industries who are very keen for a train station at Raheen industrial estate.  It is critical that the LSMATS is aligned with this vision and that we look at the national planing framework to see if it is also aligned with the vision.  It is also critical that the city and county development plans of both Limerick and Clare are aligned with that vision and that we get the zoning around these transport zones correct and appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to mention, during statements on transport, the remarkable Ms Dervla Murphy, from Lismore in the Acting Chairman's county of Waterford, who passed away recently.  She was a fearless, intrepid explorer who was fiercely dedicated to her mode of transport of choice, that is, the bicycle.  She inspired generations to travel and to enjoy getting off the beaten track.  She understood the value of spending time with local people, getting a true sense of place and she conveyed that experience to many of us through her honest and frank writing.  She took the road less travelled and that made all the difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100026#AA00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1654014600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, this debate is far too short and I only have two minutes to contribute.  I will try to be brief.  I have been a strong advocate of public transport.  I must say that the inaction over years by the Department of Transport and the NTA on simple issues that could be done immediately has been absolutely staggering.  There was a consultation on Connecting Ireland but we do not have any buses.  I have been asking Ministers, including the present Minister, and the NTA if they have done any scientific analysis or research on the relationship between the frequency of service, increases in that frequency and the number of passengers.  The answer is a deafening silence.  It is a fundamental question.<\/p>  <p>  What we know, of course, is that when the frequency of rail services from Cork to Cobh and from Athenry to Galway, and bus services from Galway to Carraroe, were increased, there was a dramatic increase in the number of passengers.  We need to get the academic, scientific evidence because it will stand up the proposition that if there is an infrequent service, people cannot be expected to take it.<\/p>  <p>  We campaigned for three buses to leave Galway for an Cheathr&uacute; Rua and to come back along the most populated route out of Galway.  It was amazing that it took a year and a half for the NTA to make a decision that should have been made in 24 hours.  We hear about active travel but there is a lack of action.  They want great and fantastic things but never seem to do the simple things that would change people's lives dramatically.<\/p>  <p>  The point made about non-urban fares is valid.  The 20% reduction in fares did not apply to the only non-subsidised company in the country, Expressway, and the private companies that provide services.  It is amazing.  They are all in rural Ireland, which is also amazing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the Salmon Weir Bridge in Galway.  I have for years wanted to see that bridge designated for public transport and active travel only.  However, there is one snag.  If we do that and do not build an extra bridge, that is, the bypass, two bridges are left across the River Corrib and one of them is very narrow.  It is not adequate to allow the 80,000 people to the west and the 3 million people to the east to get across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100026#AA00300","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1654014600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>It is a timely opportunity to discuss transport, particularly given the biblical scenes we had in Dublin Airport over the weekend.  I note the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here and I hope he is reading the inside of his passport where it states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland requests all whom it may concern to allow the bearer, a citizen of Ireland, to pass freely and without hindrance and to afford the bearer all necessary assistance and protection. <\/blockquote>  <p>I hope when the Minister has read that, he hands it over to the head of the DAA because the delays that Irish citizens experienced last weekend, before they even got out of the State, were a disgrace.  I believe the scenes are indicative of what goes on and how we work in this State.  There are many queues.  When one peels back the expensive veneer, there is dirty chipboard underneath.  There are queues at the airport and in soup kitchens.  There are invisible queues for healthcare services and for children seeking places to cater for their special educational needs.<\/p><p>Transport organisations and the Government must realise that after major events, such as pandemics and wars, the relationship between employees and employers needs restructuring.  The terms of conditions of workers in the DAA must be considered.<\/p><p>Around sustainability and transport, closer to home in north Kildare, the DART service goes as far as Maynooth.  There is a proposal for a station a mile from Kilcock but the line will not go as far as Kilcock.  We have written several times to the Minister on this issue and I have spoken to him about it.  The station is already there.  The commuters are there.  Kilcock is a thriving village.<\/p> <p>We need to bring it as far as Kilcock or at least have a park-and-ride facility there to accommodate all of the people who live in north Kildare.<\/p> <p> This weekend we will be hearing about the Kildare bus routes, Nos. 120 and 115 and the absolutely chaotic service for the thriving towns of Straffan, Prosperous, Clane and Kilcock, where the buses either arrive full or do not arrive at all and passengers are none the wiser as they wait.  If a Green Party Minister cannot see the emergency in public transport in our rural towns and villages, what hope do we have?  Public transport in rural areas is essential.  A few cycling lanes in Dublin is just not going to cut it.  Climate change is upon us and we cannot act as if it is in the future anymore.  We need to pull out all the stops and deliver on public transport all across the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100026#AA00400","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654015200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I listened to the Minister's opening statement which was absolutely tone deaf.  He did not mention Dublin Airport in his opening statement and I had to ask myself if he is actually for real.  It is absolutely incredible.  His Cabinet colleagues must be cringing.  The issues affecting Dublin Airport over the last number of weeks have been well documented.  On Sunday 1,000 people missed their flights due to delays at the airport.  I worked in the travel industry for 19 years and I find that absolutely unbelievable.  It is unimaginable that 1,000 people went to the national airport but could not get through and missed their flights.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, had the audacity on Sunday to tweet advice to passengers to contact their airline.  Who can get through to an airline on a Sunday?  I do not know what the authority expected people to do.<\/p>  <p> This was predicted, however, and all of this has its roots in the laying off of 1,000 workers by the DAA during the pandemic and the subsequent lack of workforce planning as international travel reopened.  At the time of these lay offs, Mr. Jerry Brennan of SIPTU told the DAA that it would need to rehire people because the queues would be extending through the car parks and unfortunately, never have truer words been spoken.  This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing for those people who missed their flights but it has also become an embarrassment for the State.  People have had to queue outside the terminal for over three hours and we have had little response from the Minister in charge.  It is absolutely unbelievable that he did not mention Dublin Airport in his opening statement today.  I cannot believe it.  I thought I would come down and read the statement in case I missed it.  There is no actual statement available which suggests the Minister was ad-libbing.  If he was ad-libbing he could have at least mentioned Dublin Airport.  <\/p>  <p>  Adjacent to my own constituency is Shannon Airport.  The types of issues affecting Dublin Airport have not been repeated in airports such as Shannon and Cork.  Obviously, there is a lot less traffic at these airports.  Shannon Airport is at the heart of the economy of the mid-west but for a long time it has been under-resourced and under-appreciated.  The Shannon Group was over 12 months without a chairperson under the Minister's watch, at the height of the pandemic.  Government supports for the workers at the airport were delivered at a snail's pace, ultimately leading to job losses.  Surely following the calamity at Dublin Airport, the Minister will recognise the importance of increasing traffic through the regional airports.  Prior to the pandemic almost 90% of flights departed from Dublin Airport.  In debates on aviation during the pandemic there was much talk of planning for the future of aviation but the issues at Dublin Airport indicate that these plans were not developed.  Shannon Airport accounts for 15,000 direct and 45,000 indirect jobs in the mid-west region.  There is potential to grow and develop the airport but this must begin with an increase in flight options from the region.  I would like to hear some details from the Minister on how he intends to alleviate pressure on Dublin by supporting Shannon Airport further.<\/p>  <p>  Finally and briefly I want to mention a road in my constituency, the Coonagh to Knockalisheen road.  The Green Party opposed it and forced it back down.  The road is 35% completed but the company doing the work collapsed and went into receivership.  We are now left with one third of the road built and we need to get it finished.  Will the Minister intervene and make sure the contract is completed as fast as possible and that the people who build critical infrastructure are back doing just that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100027#BB00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1654015200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The fiasco at Dublin Airport has dominated this debate today, but not by the Minister.  There is no doubt that there is a significant problem with mismanagement at the airport.  I wish we had more time to deal with that issue in its own right.  We will need to come back to it at some point but I hope the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications will have an opportunity to go through the issues in considerable detail tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on the issue of bus transport.  I have been an advocate and an active campaigner for better public transport for decades.  I am not against changes to the bus network or to how buses are run and organised and it is important to say that at the outset.  BusConnects has nine spines, two of which have been rolled out.  The Howth one seemed to work very well.  There were changes in the numbers but the overall service did not change an awful lot.  There have been substantial changes in the sea spine and there are significant problems with it.  It is working well in some respects but not in others.  Myself, my colleague, Councillor Nuala Killeen, and some other party members conducted a survey in which more than 1,200 people took part, either online or in face-to-face settings.  In the face-to-face settings a very large number of people said they would not take part because the bus service no longer met their needs.<\/p>  <p>  If one listens to the traffic reports on the radio, every day north Kildare is featured.  We must have a bus and train service that works but there are significant problems.  The NTA is very slow to make changes.  I will give a quick run down of some of the issues people mentioned in the survey.  Common issues were morning buses not turning up and less frequent services than previously.  The No. 52 bus is scheduled to run once an hour but frequently does not turn up, both ways.  People reported a high rate of empty buses.  Some buses run every half an hour and on one particular route, a taxi would be an over-supply.  A double decker bus is running from 4.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. and is practically empty when there are other routes where demand is not being met.  This is a diversion from a direct service.  The NTA is not managing the feedback.  In fact, my office has become the complaints department.  People do not feel safe at bus stops.  Very often they are alighting from feeder buses in unlit areas and can be waiting for up to half an hour for the bus to arrive.  There is a mismatch between the times the buses arrive.  Very often the buses arrive full and an awful lot do not show up at all.  I have never come across such a number of no-shows and it is not exclusively on Bus Connects.  As we roll out those spines, we really have to get to grips with the problems in each before rolling out the next one.  Otherwise, the same pattern will emerge.<\/p>  <p>  We were told by people who want to use the bus every day and who would be very happy to do so that they cannot because of the amount of no-shows.  They cannot be sure if they go that they can get back.  This is a problem on the services that were privatised and awarded to Go Ahead as well as on Dublin Bus services.  Frequently the No. 126 to Naas is cancelled after 7 p.m.  The No. 120 bus has become a joke, particularly in the mornings.  People told us that they had to take a day's leave because the bus simply did not turn up.  These are buses that would ordinarily be full.  These are not buses that just a small number of people are using.  People are being left behind frequently.  The NTA has told us that it is aware of this and is monitoring it.  Either it can provide a service or it cannot.  <\/p>  <p>  If one makes a criticism, one has the public transport lobby on top of one saying that one should not be criticising changes but the reality is that some of those changes were not good.  It was well flagged in advance that some of the changes would be problematic and would not meet the needs of the public.  One thing that we did not anticipate, even when there was a service advertised, is the number of no-shows.  They have become a real problem on both Dublin Bus and Go Ahead services.  It is all very well to have reduced fares - that was a good initiative - but they are no good if people end up having to use taxis.  I am coming across that frequently and then it becomes uneconomic to use public transport.  There are very significant problems and I do not feel we are being heard.  Kildare County Council is having a special meeting with the NTA to discuss the no-shows on the No. 126 and No. 120 service.<\/p> <p>This is the kind of public pressure that is coming on in relation to delivering a public transport service.  It has to be reliable.  If it is not reliable, people will use it once and then give up if they have an alternative.<\/p> <p> I cannot impress enough on the Minister of State that unless the various spines are rolled out in a way that works for people, and unless he gets that right and gets feedback from people, this will not work.  The same problems are emerging for people in Lucan as are emerging in north Kildare.  I ask the Minister of State to take particular note of this and to get on to the National Transport Authority to make the service work for people.  These people are being told they are to be provided with a service.  We will not have a sustainable transport solution if people feel that the service is unreliable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100027#BB00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654015800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this timely and important debate.  I will not dwell too long on the absolutely farcical scenes going on in Dublin Airport at the moment, but I will reiterate every comment made by my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, earlier in this debate and throughout the week in his role as chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  I am happy to leave it there.  We all know that what is happening is completely unsustainable.  There needs to be a swift and sustainable resolution.  The powers that be at Dublin Airport who have allowed this to occur must be answerable to the Government and to the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  There are three areas I would like to focus on, which are relatively positive areas on which we should be able to find some agreement.  I really welcome that we have had the first decrease in public transport fares in 75 years.  This is extremely welcome.  I absolutely welcome that this is scheduled to go through 2022.  We need real indicators to show the success of this measure in the context of uptake in the use of public transport.  If possible, perhaps this is something that should go right into 2023 also.<\/p>  <p>  There are two other areas I wish to raise specifically, which will not be unfamiliar to the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, given that we represent neighbouring constituencies.  The first is in relation to Luas capacity.  Many of the problems faced by the Luas, and especially the green line, have been masked by the pandemic and by the welcome shift towards working remotely and will be masked by the fact that secondary schools are currently breaking up, and third level institutions have already broken up, for the summer.  It cannot be avoided, however, that come September we once again will see the Luas at absolute peak capacity throughout the green line.  Across my constituency, at the stops at Glencairn, Leopardstown Valley, or Ballyogan, people are prepared to take the Luas coming out of town towards Brides Glen and Cherrywood, to try to get a Luas back into town, such is the issue around timetabling, capacity and congestion.  The Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, knows as well as I do that there are upwards of 5,000 new homes about to come on stream along that line on Ballyogan Road, in Cherrywood, in Glenamuck Road and in Enniskerry Road, and across Stepaside and Carrickmines.  The need to genuinely look at increasing the capacity on the Luas is vitally important.<\/p>  <p>  The last area of transportation and mobility I will speak on is the old reliable, which is Dublin Bus.  The whole point of encouraging people to get onto Dublin Bus and use it more often is not just about frequency and fares: it is also about ensuring timetables that work around the needs of the vast majority of people who take those buses.  I will give the Minister of State two examples of the No. 47 and the No. 44 buses that start out in Stepaside or Enniskerry.  These routes serve many schools and businesses, along with St. Vincent's hospitals and the city centre.  Those timetables are simply not working for the vast majority of people, and particularly those secondary school children in that area of Stepaside, Sandyford or Leopardstown.  They simply do not have a bus available for them to get into school in adequate time.  I ask the Minister of State to speak with Dublin Bus to raise this issue.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100028#CC00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1654015800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Given the disruption to transport we have all seen in the last days, it is really timely that we are having this debate now.

If pay and conditions need to be reassessed to attract and retain talent, then I really hope they are reassessed.  If we have Dublin Airport branded as a more attractive place for people to work, it would ensure that we could stop these absolutely embarrassing scenes we are seeing.  It is embarrassing because the DAA knows exactly how many flights are coming in and going out.  The DAA knows exactly how many passengers to expect but it is simply not catering to them.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to highlight some local transport issues.  I have raised the matter of Kishoge rail station again and again on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  It is 12 years since the station was built and trains still whizz past it without stopping.  We need that station opened.  We need it opened as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  On the C spine, which is one of the two BusConnects spines in operation at the moment, we need the full service and not buses that drop off the app instead of arriving.  We also need to deliver a public service to the people who were previously served by the Dublin Bus routes, including those people in Hillcrest, Dodsborough, Lucan village and Laraghcon.<\/p>  <p>  The planned W6 orbital route is a new route that will go from Maynooth to Tallaght.  It will connect with places such as Hazelhatch, Celbridge, Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart.  It is a really important orbital strand but we are hearing now that it is going to be delayed again.  With so many students going either to Maynooth University or to the Technological University Dublin in Tallaght, we need to make sure that we are providing those transportation links, especially for those commuters going to Greenogue.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to commuters, while we all absolutely welcome the implementation of the progressive and positive measure of the reduction in fares in public transport, which is currently a 20% reduction across the board and a 50% reduction for young people, I am very concerned that commuters who use public transport every day are not feeling any benefit from this new measure.  A TaxSaver commuter ticket is about 20% more expensive than using a Transport for Ireland, TFI, Leap card to go in and out of work five days per week.  That does not make sense.  This was supposed to be a measure brought in to benefit people who plan ahead and get an annual ticket.

We are seeing the benefits of active travel and the extension of greenways and cycleways in my area, which is very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I echo concerns that were mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v earlier about the frequency of services.  As I said, I am lucky to live on the Cork to Cobh railway line.  I regularly use the train heading up from Little Island or Glounthaune into the city.  Given the Government investment of &euro;185 million to that line to make it fully electrified and fully accessible, in a couple of years' time we will have a train every five minutes.  This will be massive for the area.  Unfortunately, there are many rural areas in my constituency such as Grenagh, Carrignavar, Whitechurch and Upper Glanmire where the bus service is so infrequent it is like apples and oranges when compared with the offering of public transport on both sides.  I am aware that we cannot have trains on everybody's doorstep but, at the same time, in those rural areas in particular we need to have a greater emphasis on public transport in the context of our bus provision.<\/p>  <p>   It would be remiss of me not to mention the debacle that is Dublin Airport.  I believe it is over-simplistic for people to suggest diverting flights to Cork or Shannon but the Government and the DAA should be doing their best to subsidise additional flights out of those regional airports.  Perhaps in the medium term it is one way that we could actually alleviate some of the pressure off Dublin.  In the shorter term, something has to be looked at in the area of security and how quickly people can get through those channels in Dublin Airport.<\/p>  <p>  The reduction in fares that was handed out some weeks ago is to be broadly welcomed.  It is great to see people using that train line, which has been there most of my lifetime.  I see people using it for the first time now, and using the buses that are going in and out of the city quite frequently.  It is now cheaper and more competitively priced for people to leave the car at home, not have to pay the parking charges in the city, or wherever it is they are off to, and to get the public transport option.  This needs to be further built on going into future budgets.  It is one part of our policy where we need to sweat the assets as best we can.

There will be 3,500 new homes built on the Irish Glass Bottle site and there is no prospect of a Luas, which was part of the planning application and the strategic development zone, SDZ.  Residents in the new houses are being held hostage.  We have a cycle lane but I think I am the only one who uses it.  Some 3,500 new homes are being built on this site and the Luas has been kicked down the road for another ten or 15 years.  Se&aacute;n Moore Road is already a car park.  Residents cannot move in or out during peak hours.  The Government has now decided not to put a Luas there even though that was an important part of granting planning permission for the glass bottle site.  Residents feel let down by the Government.  They feel it is a game of smoke and mirrors.  They were told they would get a Luas, new bridges, public transport and infrastructure.

When the Minister did speak, he spoke for 20 minutes without reference to the one aspect of transport policy that the whole country is talking about, that is, the debacle at Dublin Airport.  Even if we were to take into account the new language the Department has insisted we use, around accelerating sustainability and mobility, the Minister's remarks simply tell me there are two realities in this country - the reality that goes on in Eamon Ryan's head and the reality facing the real people of Ireland, constituents such as mine.<\/p>  <p>  I come from a county and a region that has no rail network and this Government has zero plans to change that.  Anybody relying on public transport relies on the bus services, which are minimal at best.  That is being generous.  Unless you are going to Dublin city centre, there is virtually nowhere you can get a public bus to from my constituency.  If people do decide to get the bus, the bus station is in an embarrassing state.  Again, the Minister will not intervene in that regard.  The people who travel by bus by and large have to travel by private operators.  They get no benefit whatsoever from the so-called discounts for public transport.  When the Government introduced a 50% reduction for young people last October, I challenged the Minister on the fact that that discount would not be available to many of my constituents.  Nothing has been done since.  When the 20% reduction across the board was introduced as a temporary so-called cost-of-living measure, it was again not applicable to many of the people I represent.  The truth is that many of them rely on their cars.  While the cost of travelling to work or dropping children to school has been increasing, the Government has sat on its hands and introduced very few measures to target those costs.  In fact, I would argue there are some people in government who are actually quite smug about the fact that fuel prices have increased.<\/p>  <p>  Our road network is in a deplorable state.  Local roads across County Monaghan and similar counties are in a desperate state while the Government takes money from the road network to put into pet projects.  There is no better example than the N2, which would be a major artery to the north west.  This year, the Government removed money from the section of that road going from Clontibret to the Border and put it into the Minister for Transport's pet project.  When pressure was exerted by Government Members from different parts of the country, unfortunately the Government representatives from Cavan-Monaghan must have stayed silent because the project has now been shelved, according to this Minister.  The Minister is quite clearly out of his depth.  I hope he will prove me wrong by starting to fund projects that will actually ensure people can drive to work after paying their road tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100029#DD00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1654016400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to get back to me on the issue of the CI&Eacute; regular wages scheme statutory instrument.  Five weeks ago, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told me it would be signed within two weeks.  Thousands of workers are waiting for this statutory instrument to be signed and it has already taken two years for the State to respond.  This is not a great way to treat transport workers and it is certainly not a great sign of the respect and priority we give public transport.  I ask the Minister of State to get back to me on that as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The key issue for People Before Profit is that of free and frequent public transport.  We have always had a problem in Ireland when it comes to investing in public transport.  At the highest level, there has been an attitude of begrudgery around State subsidies and supports for public transport.  Transport emissions account for 40% of Ireland's total carbon emissions.  In 2020, road transport alone accounted for 94% of transport emissions in Ireland, with private cars accounting for 74% of all journeys nationally, compared to just 7% by bus and rail.  If we are to reach our climate targets, we need a massive shift away from private forms of transport, including private electric vehicles.  Public transport has a vital function and role in helping society shift away from private vehicles to mass transit.  There is a problem here, partly because of the legacy of begrudgery I spoke about but also due to a dearth of imagination on behalf of the Government, or a dearth of understanding as to how important public transport is and will be in dealing with the climate crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Over 100 cities and regions globally have initiated free public transport, for a variety of reasons but increasingly as a climate measure.<\/p> <p>It is not an overnight solution and we know its impact will be limited unless we also significantly increase the frequency and accessibility of public transport, not just in our towns and cities but also in our rural communities.  Fare-free public transport is the future and that idea will grow.  I welcome the recent fare reductions, the first in the State since 1947.  Since the fare reductions in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Local Link last month, passenger numbers have increased by 10%.  Free public transport was provided to the over-66s and we all know the considerable benefit that continues to give.<\/p> <p> The benefits of frequent free public transport include greater connectivity, social inclusion for the vulnerable and marginalised groups and the revitalisation of urban and rural areas.  Such a shift is essential if we are to achieve our reductions in global gas emissions.

I very much look forward to representatives of the DAA appearing before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications tomorrow and answering questions.  The public are entitled to a service and that service is simply not up to scratch.  I look forward to the representatives explaining how the DAA will get passengers through the airport in a timely fashion, which I expect them to outline tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  The underlying problem relates to the national aviation policy.  We in the transport committee have received a commitment from the Minister for Transport that that policy will be reviewed.  This is important not just for Dublin Airport but for the entire country.  One airport is overly dominant.  Other countries have examined this question, such as the Dutch Government in regard to Schiphol Airport.  It has enacted policy decisions to spread out the traffic more evenly to airports in other regions of the Netherlands.  A similar policy is being pursued in Finland and Austria and we need to do the same here.  The national aviation policy has not been reviewed since 2015 and the mask has begun to slip, as can be seen in the chaotic scenes at Dublin Airport.  We need to look at the role Shannon Airport, as well as other airports such as those in Cork or Knock outside of the greater Dublin area, can play.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the points made by the new chairperson of Shannon Group, Mr. Conal Henry, when he appeared before the transport committee last week.  He stated that the national aviation policy is a critical issue, and we need to move on that.  Doing so would be good not just for the regions but for Ireland.  Dublin Airport is creaking at the seams.  We have spare capacity at Shannon Airport, where only one third of the capacity is used, and it would be excellent for balanced regional development.  It would mean much more than a catchphrase and would bring it in line with strong Government policies such as Project Ireland 2040 and our regional economic and business plans.  We need to bring the aviation policy into line with those policies and look on our airport as a regional driver of economic activity for the mid-west and the western seaboard.<\/p>  <p>  In his concluding remarks, the Minister of State might confirm whether the national aviation policy will be reviewed and outline a timeframe for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100030#EE00400","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1654017000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Given the extraordinary scenes that took place in our airports over the weekend, it would have been important to have the Minister for Transport or the Minister of State at the Department present for this debate but, unfortunately, that is not the case.

What is fundamentally important - it is a mistake that this was not done between 2011 and 2016 - is that funding be ring-fenced for public transport projects despite economic conditions.  That is important work that needs to be done, not only nationally here but also in conjunction with the European Commission, to ensure we will give funding towards sustainable projects, such as those we are discussing during this debate, in order that projects relating to rail, BusConnects and other public transport will be protected no matter what the economic circumstances are, within the bounds of reason.

There is no concrete plan yet in place to deal with a new park-and-ride infrastructure facility such as those that are planned on other arterial routes with access to and from Dublin, and that is a disgrace.

Irish Rail has an extensive order in at the moment, and delivery of the first of those battery-electric units is expected.

I start by expressing my concerns at a report in the press yesterday that seemed to throw cold water on the prospect of the Limerick-Waterford railway being used to take traffic off our roads.  The report implied a senior engineering figure in the N24 project said that even if the Waterford-Limerick train service speed was increased by enough to half the journey time, use of the line would only increase by 0.3%.  It would be proper for the Minister to expand on the detail of this report and outline exactly what the terms of reference relating to it were.  If key factors such as timetabling were excluded, then the study does not properly assess the viability of improving the line because it does not paint a true picture.  I have spoken to the Minister time and time again.  The timetable as it currently stands does not suit people getting to work and does not suit students either.  You could build a rail line that is the most expensive in the world but without a timetable that suits people's needs and demands, it is not going to be used to its full potential.  That is why, when it comes to studies of the viability of, for example, the Limerick to Rosslare or Limerick Junction to Waterford lines, you cannot be selective about what is taken into account.  I urge all involved to publish that report immediately so we can see what was taken into account and what factors this 0.3% was drawn from.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Limerick to Ballybrophy line, millions of euro have been spent on upgrading the track to continuous welded rail.  However, the current service level is again inadequate to meet the public transport needs of the communities along the line.  A third middle-of-the-day service must be introduced as well as a later evening commuter service from Limerick to Nenagh.  These changes are possible if the will was there to provide adequate PSO funding in the NTA's 2023 budget for additional rail services.  This is where the Minister comes into it.  He must make the call here.  He must take the lead and deliver for the communities across the country who are sick and tired of being lectured to about alternative methods of transport, yet are being denied this luxury at every turn.  Adequate PSO funding is needed and the Minister's response can make a real difference here.  I call on him to take action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100031#FF00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1654017600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The mind boggles.  We are talking about transport and the Minister is not present.  That is incredible.<\/p>  <p>  The issues of delays with passport applications and the long delays at airports are a disgrace and need to be sorted out.  My party colleagues have set out these issues in great detail.  As I only have a short time, I will not dwell on them, except to say we have a great reputation as a tourist destination and this is being damaged because of incompetence and greed.  This greed saw a short-term view being taken when the DAA made a third of its workforce redundant.  The authority is reaping what it has sown and must engage with SIPTU to address workers' concerns if this issue is to be solved in the long term.<\/p>  <p>  Rural areas of Kildare and Laois are poorly served by public transport.  If the Minister is serious about climate action, this needs to be addressed.  A few town links are not the answer.  Kildare and Laois need a central bus hub in the likes of Newbridge and Portlaoise where town links converge and where it is possible to transfer to other services.  We need to ensure that someone can go from Carbury to Naas General Hospital or from Monasterevin to Intel in Leixlip as easily as possible.  We need a reliable and regular service if the Government is to entice people out of their cars.  What is in place at the moment is not working.<\/p>  <p>  It is great that electric cars are becoming more popular, but we are facing a ticking time bomb if the Government does not provide local authorities with funding to enable them to expand the car-charging network.  What does the Minister think they are going to do and where does he think they are going to get chargers if he does not provide them with funds?  Now is the time to invest in order that we are not left stranded in eight years' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100031#FF00500","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1654018200,"counter":195,"content":"<p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Dublin Airport has been in the news for all the wrong reasons.  The debacle on Saturday and Sunday was covered by <i>The New York Times<\/i>and many other worldwide publications, with images of passengers at their wits' end and mind-boggling queues of hundreds of people trying to get into the airport building, even before they began the process of checking in bags and clearing security.  The images beamed out on Sunday from Dublin Airport by the media reflect badly on the DAA and are very damaging.  Several overseas visitors have already publicly vowed never to return here following their experience at the airport.  Irish people hoping to start their first holiday in two years were left grounded and in limbo, many of them in tears as their flights left without them.  Our land of a thousand welcomes became a place of no escape for 1,000 passengers whose feet were firmly left on the ground last Sunday.  This is not the impression of Ireland we want to send across the world.  Repeat performances cannot be tolerated.<\/p><p>Ironically, while hundreds of passengers cannot get into the airport, dozens more cannot leave it when they arrive in Dublin, especially if they arrive after midnight.  This is due to a serious shortage of taxis at arrivals.  It is not because there are not enough taxis available to serve the needs of incoming passengers.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  It is happening because regulations introduced by the DAA in 2016 changed the criteria for obtaining airport taxi permits.  Now all taxis picking up passengers must be wheelchair accessible.  The result is that the use of saloon style cars is no longer permitted.  Due to their design, saloon cars are not capable of accommodating the standard size wheelchair.  While saloon-style taxis can continue to drop passengers at the airport departures, they do not have a permit to pick up passengers at arrivals.  Taxi operators must leave the airport without any passengers while lengthy passenger queues wait for a taxi outside arrivals in both winter and summer.<\/p><p>This is not cost effective for taxi owners, who lose half their potential earnings as they drive out of the airport empty.  The important point is that it is also both perplexing and annoying for passengers, particularly those arriving in Ireland from abroad who have travelled during night hours and who have travelled on long-haul flights.  Nobody wants to queue for a taxi in the middle of the night.  The provision of user-friendly transport options for disabled people is of major importance to everybody.  The DAA is to be commended on taking action in this regard, but surely with a little initiative it is possible to meet the needs of everyone.<\/p><p>I will highlight another anomaly that is both extraordinary and ridiculous.  It is happening in Tipperary and elsewhere across the country.  At present, drivers must stop driving school transport when they reach their 70th birthday.  This is causing a major problem for school transport companies.  The age profile of drivers is climbing as it is not viable for younger people to attain a D licence due to the cost of qualifying as a professional driver.  The bus and coach industry is suffering.  It cannot get young drivers.  The majority of drivers on school runs are retired people who choose to work part-time and those who had the correct licence category from the old licensing system.  Ironically, drivers over 70 years of age can continue to work in private hire once certified medically fit.  They can also take a full-size coach to the UK or any part of Europe, but they cannot do a local school run.  It defies belief.  People over 70 years of age can also work for other State bodies, such as TFI, so why does the age rule apply to school transport?  This rule should and must be changed to safeguard the future of school transport.  Age is not a number, and a person's worth is not determined by his or her birth certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100032#GG00100","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1654018200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I was hoping the Minister would be present because, on 28 April, I highlighted to him during Leaders' Questions the dysfunction that exists in DAA management, which was clearly seen at the weekend.  It is also a reflection of the Government's ability to spend eye-watering sums on Dublin Airport without any regard to the efficiencies or capacities it delivers.  I suggest that the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, look at the exclusions that were offered to workers who were made redundant and see if they can be brought back on short-time working.  Perhaps the Army could be brought in as well to try to get over this debacle.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to speak about Waterford Airport, the home of Rescue 117, and the capacity increases that were mooted for that airport in the 1990s.  It was, in fact, the first regional airport used by a fledgling Ryanair.  The runway extension to allow jet activity was in the previous programme for Government, but it was walked away from because of prevailing politics at the time.  The airport's catchment mirrors that of University Hospital Waterford, with more than 530,000 people living in the area.  There is a population of 1.5 million, which is growing, within 90 minutes' travel time of Waterford Airport.  On 28 April, I also raised with the Minister the Department's stated funding of &euro;160 million for the national aviation sector, while bypassing Waterford Airport completely.  I expect the Minister of State will have heard in the news this morning that private equity of &euro;8 million has now been secured for Waterford Airport to fund the expansion of the runway extension there.  It will also require a combined investment of &euro;2 million from the local authorities and &euro;5 million from the Government.  I thank Deputies Verona Murphy and Lowry, who are in the Regional Group, for visiting, and making representations for, the airport.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a few points that the Minister of State might convey to the Minister.  I expect that this funding will be delivered by way of grant aid and not be based on some public procurement capital plan.  Currently, we are a year down the road in Waterford in trying to acquire lands for the South East Technological University.  Grant money would be the most expeditious way to deliver funding to the airport.  If the cost envelope for this new runway extends beyond what has been anticipated, the people of the south east and I would expect that the Government will fund any shortfalls.  That is equitable treatment, and it is something the Government has announced for shoring up cost overruns in other public sector procurement processes under way at present.  I also ask that the Minister make a formal announcement as soon as possible welcoming the private sector announcement and honouring the deal that was made with Waterford and the south east regarding delivery of this vital infrastructure.  It is long past time that it was delivered.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the recent public transport fares reduction, with the NTA launching a 20% reduction in public transport fares.  Why was this not extended to the private sector, particularly to bus operators?  Semi-State companies should not have a monopoly in this country, but that is exactly what the Government is now reinforcing with its policy.  It is uncompetitive and discriminatory against private bus operators.  It will mean that private routes will be lost in the future, thereby discommoding customers with less choice and more costs.  I ask the Minister of State to speak to the NTA to find a way to try to support a ticketing solution to deliver discounts in these private fares as well.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to heavy goods vehicle, HGV, and bus and lorry driving licences from Ukraine, and this has arisen previously, we have a number of people in this country who have both HGV and bus licences but who cannot have them accepted by the NTA.  Car licences are immediately accepted in this country.  Again, this is something that must be examined.<\/p>  <p>  On cardiac care, I raised in the House in the last week the issue of 134 blue-light transfers out of Waterford, with the average travelling time to Cork taking three hours and 15 minutes.  Perhaps the Minister might care to make a public comment on the T&aacute;naiste's statement in the House during the debate on the national maternity hospital that it had to be in Dublin because a lady suffering a cardiac arrest could access ICU care in 20 minutes.  What does that say for us in the south east?  Is the Government aware that the international standard protocol for accessing cardiac catheterisation is 90 minutes from the onset of pain and first responder?<\/p>  <p>  These are matters I hope the Minister of State will take up with the Minister.  We need the N25 upgraded to give us a cardiac pathway for out-of-hours care.  Far more importantly, we need the delivery of 24-7 cardiac care at University Hospital Waterford.  I expect to see this delivered in the Government's programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100032#GG00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1654018200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>On 30 July 2009, the former Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey, travelled from Cork to Midleton to reopen the rail link to Midleton.  There had been a big campaign for a number of years and it was a huge success.  I recently met with an official of &Iacute;arnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and he told me it is planned to electrify the system from Mallow to Midleton to Cobh and it is planned eventually to have services every 15 minutes.  That is very good.  Part of the issue that happened there was that a lot of land had to be zoned in the area to provide a population base to make it sustainable.  That has been done.<\/p>  <p>  The N25, which is very close to this, is not fit for purpose and recently the Minister pulled a project to upgrade it.<\/p> <p>That puts 2,500 houses at risk, does not help to make what is a very dangerous road safer and further locks in a 64 ha Industrial Development Agency, IDA, site because the road is not upgraded.  Perhaps the Minister of State could give us some clarity on that at some stage.  It is hugely important.<\/p> <p> In my area there is the N25 Castlemartyr bypass.  My colleague, Deputy Shanahan, has just mentioned the N25 as well.  There are massive tailbacks on that road at this time of the year, every day and every evening, leading to Castlemartyr.  Anyone who listens to the radio reports will hear about that.  That needs to be progressed.  I know there are now plans to upgrade the road from Midleton all the way to Youghal, but we have tailbacks of cars sitting there spouting diesel and petrol fumes for hours on end, causing frustration and delays and costing money.  That needs to change.<\/p> <p> Has anyone ever considered a school town bus service?  Every morning I notice massive congestion around schools where people drop their children to the door of the school if they can or as close as possible.  There are one or two children in each car.  That causes congestion, with people rushing and under stress.  A local school bus service, in the larger towns in particular, could alleviate a lot of that problem.<\/p> <p> They are just some of the issues I wanted to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100032#GG00300","speaker":"1515","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654018800,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I welcome today's debate on transport.  It is a hugely importantly topic.  The recent capacity issues at Dublin Airport demonstrate yet again the need for a national aviation policy.  What happened to people left stranded was outrageous.  We need an all-Ireland approach to aviation as distinct from a Dublin Airport-centric policy.  The sooner we have that debate the better.<\/p>  <p>  I come from a rural constituency, Mayo.  A majority of people living there are reliant on private cars.  We do not have the frequency of public transport to accommodate people's need to travel to local towns and villages.  Even though Mayo Local Link is making huge strides, it will be some time before we have the frequency of public transport necessary for a reliable rural service.  The Government should introduce an enhanced grant scheme for electric vehicles for those living in rural Ireland.  Providing people in rural Ireland with better incentives to switch to EVs makes sense not just for individual purchasers but also for the State as we strive to reduce transport emissions by 51% by 2030.  If the Government is serious about getting as many petrol and diesel cars off the road as quickly as possible, it must introduce an enhanced grant scheme in tandem with increased investment in public transport connectivity and EV charging points in rural communities throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  While Government policy is to encourage people to take public transport, many small towns and rural parts of Ireland have not yet seen the signs of a bus stop, never mind a bus shelter.  That needs to be addressed as a matter of priority.  The roll-out of bus shelters needs to be addressed.  It is to be hoped a plan will come soon.<\/p>  <p>  As for rail, overcrowding on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Westport route is causing huge concern during peak time on trains out of Heuston Station.  It is certainly a deterrent to commuters, students and professionals.  Additional investment is urgently needed to provide additional carriages in order to address the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100033#HH00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1654018800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Whatever about the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, not being present, the fact that no officials from the Department are physically present in the Chamber to observe the debate speaks more volumes.  The Minister is busy, I understand, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will probably tell me that the officials are watching the debate from home or online, but that speaks to a bigger problem which manifested itself on Sunday in Dublin Airport, that is, that nobody seems to take responsibility.  Nobody in the DAA will pay for what happened.  The taxpayer will pay by refunding passengers.  Nobody in the Department of Transport will take responsibility for what happened to the thousands of people and the stress that manifested itself.  That has to be dealt with, not just in the Department of Transport but across so many other Departments involved in the front line.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to sustainable transport, I really welcome the announcements made yesterday by Irish Rail about expanding services across County Mayo, in particular the introduction of a morning link service from Ballina into the Dublin-Westport route and the ongoing expansion of services to the Ballina freight depot.  We have, however, a golden rail project that is sustainable, namely the western rail corridor and its expansion up into Claremorris and on to Sligo.  That has been parked in an all-island rail review, while it seems other services around the country are being allowed to proceed.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is either serious or not about sustainable transport.  There is no sense in us sitting here like dogs barking without teeth.  This project absolutely stands up when it comes to building sustainable transport, equipping the economic side of the west of the country and building up the Atlantic economic corridor, yet there is no commitment within the Department or among officials.  There is a consistent blocking policy.  That is why it is parked in an all-island rail review.  That is not good enough anymore.  The project adds up.  It is sustainable.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, keeps telling us we need sustainability.  We keep being told that rural Ireland has to become more sustainable.  A project was put in front of the Minister.  He needs to move it on and not park it.  That is what sustainable transport is.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, when it comes to transport projects in rural areas, it is a matter of building up the sustainability of the economy of rural areas to act as a bulwark against the very strong economy of Dublin.  Building proper and accessible roads, such as the N26 from Ballina into Swinford and the R312 from Castlebar to Belmullet, develops strong communities and allows people to stay within their communities rather than commuting and travelling big distances.  That argument, however, does not seem to be understood.  These are not roads for the sake of roads.  They are all building up and supporting communities and keeping people in rural areas and stopping them from having to come to the cities.<\/p>  <p>  Sustainability and transport are absolutely dependent issues, but there needs to be a far more ambitious understanding of what sustainability is within the Department of Transport and on the part of the Minister himself.

Therefore, I am quite surprised that the issue of the day was not front and centre in the Minister's contribution, but I will come back to that.<\/p>  <p>  I lend my support to the students of Ireland on the fare reduction scheme currently in place.  I would like very much for that scheme to be continued to incentivise further the students to use public transport to get more people out of their cars.  Most Members of the House to whom I have spoken so far over the past day agree with that, so I ask the Minister of State to convey that to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the NTA to ensure that Dubliners are not deliberately excluded from the 90-minute fare zone.  As the Minister of State will have heard, Skerries and Balbriggan are not included but clearly should be.  An exception should be made and we should get that done.  Deputy O'Dowd mentioned the massive fare variations after Balbriggan or the station after that.  We need to move away from that.  It should be a fare based on getting on and getting off, not the distance travelled.  If we want to encourage people to use sustainable transport and battery electric trains, we should charge them a modest amount and the State will pick up the tab for the transport company because it is about the environment as well.<\/p>  <p>  The only thing we should be discussing, however, is the predictable and unforgivable scenes at Dublin Airport at the weekend.  Ministers have met with the DAA, yet we are no clearer if the scenes of last weekend will be repeated this coming bank holiday weekend.  I have very little faith that they will be avoided.  How many need to be in the queue before somebody asks if heads should roll?  If airport operations cannot be managed, I cannot be alone in suggesting there needs to be a change.  I am not referring to the chief executive, who has already announced his intention to move on.  We have known for almost three months that passenger numbers were rising.  It is unacceptable to hear that the DAA does not know how many passengers it is to expect on any given day.  It sells the slots, it knows the aircraft types and it can extrapolate the data, yet it does not appear to be capable of doing so.  That is frankly bizarre.  The whole situation stinks.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me in the last few seconds I have left not to mention sustainable transport and Dublin Airport in the same breath without mentioning MetroLink.

They deserve a service the same as the people of Dublin, as do the people of Goleen, Dunmanway and Clonakilty, but they are not getting the service because the Government is failing 100% to deliver for the people.<\/p>  <p>  The 20% decrease in transport fares, with a 50% decrease for young people, is a great idea, but not for the people of rural Ireland.  The private operator which carries the biggest percentage of people - I do not know how many million people it carries every year - cannot apply for the 20% or 50% decrease, so the young people who leave Skibbereen and Bantry every day to head to Cork or Dublin will not get a brown cent of that back into their pocket.  This is a disgrace for the Government.  It is a complete attack on the people of rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There has been talk about the crisis in Dublin Airport.  We have no crisis in Cork Airport.  If the people are brought down to Cork, we will make sure they fly out on time.  The great people of Cork Airport will sort it out, and the same is true for the people in Kerry and Mayo, but Dublin Airport has made an absolute shambles of it.  Nobody is answering any questions about what is going wrong.  We are only going around in circles in recent weeks.  I could spend two hours talking about the issue this evening if I had time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100034#JJ00900","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1654019400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Social media is a great thing and if we look at it, we will see that more than 12 months ago I brought up that pre-Covid Dublin Airport had 31 million people going through it; Shannon had 1.8 million, with a capacity of 4.5 million; and Cork had 2.4 million, with a capacity of 5 million.

The fact that the number of people on public transport has substantially and significantly increased because of the reduced fares proves exactly what some of us on this side of the House have been saying for a very long time.  In fact, we have asked for free public transport.  I repeat what colleagues have already said in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I would love to know what we are paying in fines if the Minister of State has the information to hand.  What fines are we paying on a regular basis for breaching our obligations under European legislation?  We clearly need to take radical action in order to meet our commitments for 2030 and 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Before I refer to Galway city, I would like to sound a note of caution about electric cars and where we are sourcing the cobalt and lithium.  This is something that has not been mentioned at all in the D&aacute;il and I would like a response from the Government regarding the human rights abuses in Congo, the use of very young children and the very exploitative working conditions concerning the extraction of cobalt in particular.<\/p> <p>I would love to see an analysis done on that.<br\/><br\/>The Minister visited Galway two weeks ago and confirmed funding was available for a feasibility study on light rail.  That has never been carried out.  It is one of the most basic requirements in Galway city, which is destined to increase its population by 50%.  More than four years ago, 24,000 people signed a petition calling on the Government to carry out a feasibility study.  As usual, the people are way ahead of us.  They will move to public transport.  They do not need enticement.  What they need are options, which we do not have.  We have not done what the people of Galway asked us to do.  We have not provided park and ride, which is a source of great upset to me because I was mayor at the time.  We led on this, as did the councillors, and put an objective in the city development plan to roll out park and ride in 2005.  Here we are in 2022, the National Transport Authority has taken over, and its latest response is it is looking at park and ride possibly being provided on the east side of the city but the west side is being ignored completely.<br\/><br\/>The Minister talked about school transport.  There is major potential if we revisit school transport with buses that could be multifunctional but are not being used.  There are some changes in the rail system from Athenry and Oranmore, which are very welcome, but they are very late and are <i>ad hoc.<\/i>There is no sense of urgency whatsoever in respect of climate change or the climate and biodiversity emergencies.  We need transformational change.  We do not need to talk about encouraging people.  They are crying out to do it differently and we need to do it differently.<br\/><br\/>I once again appeal on the public record for the most basic thing: a feasibility study on light rail for Galway.  It should consider school transport and park and ride, and ask why in God's name we are allowing the National Transport Authority to delay and delay with something as basic and fundamental as that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100034#JJ01600","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654020000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I will outline my points in three areas.  A free, widely available and decarbonised public transport system must be at the heart of a just transition and transformation.  In Ireland, transport makes up the largest demand for energy.  It is responsible for more than 40% of energy-related CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions.  In 2021, private cars represented 42% of total transport energy demand.  In the same year, bus or coach represented only 3% and rail was less than 1% of that demand.  To remove the dependency on private cars, we need to transform our public transport system.  We need an intermodal system of buses, light rail, walking and cycling lanes.  We need to connect rural areas to the main towns and cities and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Bus and rail need to be interconnected and adapted to local needs.  All railway routes and stations that were taken out of service need to be brought back into service.<\/p><p>Public transport has to be seen as a public service.  All public services must be accessible to everyone and free at the point of use.  This is something the State has yet to achieve in any of our underfunded public services.  Public transport needs to be widely available and free to encourage people to use it instead of private cars.  The 20% reduction in fares introduced in April will help, to a degree, people struggling with high inflation and stagnant income, but it is not enough.  The public transport subsidy for Dublin Bus compares very badly with other European cities at 29%, which is only half of the average across Europe.  For example, Lyons in France has a 79% subsidy, Brussels has a 68% subsidy and most comparable European cities are above a 60% subsidy.<\/p><p>The other aspect of this issue is the removal of fossil fuels from the transport system, not only to avert a looming climate disaster but to eliminate the growing problem of air pollution.  We know that densely populated areas with high traffic levels particularly affect children.  Our public transport system needs to be upgraded using electricity and hydrogen fuels as an alternative to diesel.  I take Deputy Connolly's point about lithium and cobalt.  We must have an investigation into their use and human rights abuses in the Congo and so on.<\/p><p>For a high-quality, free public transport system to be viable we need a sustainable approach to urban mobility, transport and planning and development in rural areas.  New housing must be concentrated in villages to allow for good transport links that will allow people to access jobs, schools, shops and other essential services.  We will no doubt be told this will cost a lot and we cannot afford it.  My answer to that is we cannot not afford it.  Everything has to change.  The global neoliberal economic model of capitalism is dependent on oil.  Rich countries are dependent on it, while at the same time authoritarian regimes depend on selling it to rich countries.  One way or the other, oil creates pollution, climate damage, social injustice and wars.  The change has to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100035#KK00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1654020000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank all Members for their contributions.  It is clear we are all committed to improving and increasing sustainable mobility throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  Transport is central to Ireland's decarbonisation efforts.  In 2020, road transport alone accounted for 94% of transport emissions.  Road transport also contributes to increased levels of noise, collisions, congestion and pollutants that can have a negative impact on people's health and the environment.  To garner permanent reductions in our emissions, we must make changes in our everyday life towards sustainable behaviours.  The Government has committed to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland to reduce our carbon emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change.  As the Minister outlined, we are putting in place the infrastructure, services and structures to reduce car dependency and implement a major shift towards sustainable mobility.  We are taking action now that will pay dividends in future years.<\/p>  <p>  Our commitment is evident in the national planning framework, the climate action plan and the national sustainable mobility policy.  It is also backed up by the funding allocated under the national development plan, NDP.  The unprecedented funding for transport under the NDP will enable significant investment in walking, cycling, bus and rail infrastructure and will expand sustainable mobility options in our cities, towns and villages.  We are already seeing evidence of this investment throughout the country.  NDP funding will support the commencement of major public transport projects of BusConnects in our five cities, and DART+ and MetroLink in Dublin, along with increased investment in the interurban and regional rail network.  This will be complemented by an expansion of public transport services, including in rural and regional areas, under the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to funding active travel infrastructure to provide more walking and cycling facilities to increase people's green travel options.  According to the Central Statistics Office, almost 30% of trips are less than 2 km of which 57% are made by car.  The significant investment in active travel infrastructure over the next three years will enable more of these, and some longer journeys, to be made by walking and cycling.  Improving our walking, cycling and public transport options can also deliver social change.  Everybody should be able to use active travel and public transport regardless of their ability or background.  Sustainable transport modes are not only the most environmentally friendly options; they are also the most economically accessible and socially inclusive.  They are a key part of a just transition towards meeting our climate goals and they will help us meet our targets in a fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  The goal of the Minister for Transport is to increase the number of sustainable mobility options available to all our citizens.  Where possible, he is incentivising public transport through investment in new services and infrastructure as well as by reducing the fare structures.  In recognition that it is not always possible to provide public transport, especially in remote areas, there is also a complementary suite of incentives to electrify private transport, such as the electric vehicle purchase grant and the domestic charger grant scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside the climate action plan, the new sustainable mobility policy is central to ensuring we meet our ambitious climate targets.  The actions under the new policy provide an opportunity to change our daily travel choices by making it easier and more attractive for people to make fewer private car journeys and to use walking, cycling and public transport, where possible.  The Department of Transport listened closely to stakeholders in developing the policy and action plan to ensure we are focusing on the right measures.<\/p>  <p>  We have the right plans and policies in place and our focus now is to accelerate delivery.  Key to this delivery is the new leadership group led by the Department of Transport in collaboration with the NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, local authorities and regional assemblies.  This group will work collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to drive the implementation of programmes, such as BusConnects in the five cities, the connecting Ireland rural mobility plan and other key active travel and public transport projects.<\/p> <p> As the Minister outlined, the first task of this group is to agree a mechanism to deliver a programme of pathfinder projects of scale at local level over the next three years.  The group is already working to identify a programme of projects that will provide a template of people-focused development that can be replicated and scaled up.  Drawing on the experiences of collaboration across the public service during the Covid-19 pandemic, experimental and innovative approaches are being encouraged where they can be delivered and at pace.  These projects will demonstrate their capacity to achieve carbon abatement and other important co-benefits in line with the policy&rsquo;s goals.<\/p> <p> The next iteration of the Climate Action Plan this year will be based on legally binding sectoral emission ceilings, including for transport.  The first carbon budget to 2025 is likely to be particularly challenging for the transport sector, as embedded behavioural change elements are more difficult to achieve in the shorter time horizon.  It will be important to demonstrate the types of project and initiative that can deliver a lower carbon future for transport.  For this reason, the pathfinder programme is intended to offer a pathway and a vision of sustainable mobility in practice, which can act as a catalyst for the wider changes required across society and be replicated at national level.<\/p> <p> Through continued collaboration with our stakeholders at national, regional and local levels, we can implement real change and make sustainable mobility the preferred option for as many people as possible.

These are just some of the headlines that we have seen over just the past four days.  This is Ireland of 2022.  We are one of the richest countries on the planet, yet families, workers and others are cutting back on eating.  We have to sit back for a second and think about the implications of that.  Households, families and workers who are paying their taxes are getting up in the morning and choosing to go without.  They have no choice but to cut down daily and weekly on eating.  That we have reached such a point in this day and age is a great shame.<\/p><p>Research published today by Kantar shows that households are cutting back on the amount of food they are buying.  Grocery inflation is at its highest level in almost nine years.  Prices in supermarkets have risen by 5.5% in the past 12 months, the largest increase since August 2013.  Coinciding with this is a fall in take-home grocery sales of 6.5% in the past 12 weeks.  This shows that people are already cutting back, and the situation is due to get worse as inflation continues.  These figures reflect data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which show that staples like milk, bread and cheese have increased in price in the past year.<\/p><p>An organiser of a food bank in Dublin today stated that the food bank was seeing record demand, having doubled in recent weeks alone, and that full-time workers were skipping meals and visiting food banks.  Research from Permanent TSB shows that more than 60% of people feel that they will have to cut back spending on food in the coming year due to the cost of living crisis.  CSO data show that groceries will cost an extra &euro;708 over the next year.  This is on top of increases in the cost of diesel, petrol, electricity, oil, gas, childcare and rent.  The list goes on.<\/p><p>This State has a real poverty problem, and it is one that is growing.  Recent survey on income and living conditions, SILC, data published by the CSO this month showed an increase across the board, with levels of consistent poverty, at risk of poverty and deprivation having increased for those aged over 65 years and for those with disabilities.  These are alarming increases.  Deprivation levels have increased to 44% among long-parent families, who already experience sustained consistent poverty rates.  Yesterday, a report from Social Justice Ireland showed that almost 1 million people were living in poverty.  It is incredible and shameful to think that we are in this situation.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will talk about the budget of eight months ago and so on, but no matter what the Government says, not enough has been done.  Where we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been able to, we have welcomed what has been done so far, but this motion seeks a cost of living cash payment.  We need to put money into people&rsquo;s pockets as quickly as possible.  I hope that the Government will be able to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100036#LL00500","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1654020600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>We know that the cost of living is rising.

However, we are facing a new part of the cost of living crisis, that being, food poverty.  People are finding it increasingly difficult to put food on the table.  More than 60% of people say that they are now making choices in terms of food.  This is a crisis point.  No spin can be put on this.  It is a crisis when people cannot pay for food to put on their tables or when they have to make a choice about whether they will put food on their tables, fill their cars, heat their homes or meet life&rsquo;s basic necessities.<\/p>  <p>  One would imagine that the Government would say that it needed to take action quickly and that it would do everything it could to help the most vulnerable in society.  Every Deputy has been approached by constituents who are suffering greatly because of the major increase in the cost of living.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in ran a survey on the cost of living crisis.  Of those who had come to us saying that they were struggling with food, one pensioner replied that it was not possible to live on what was left after paying the electricity bill by card at An Post.  The pensioner could not afford groceries, was eating the bare minimum and said that life was very hard.  This is the reality for people.  A woman in her 40s said that there was a major difference &ndash; approximately &euro;30 of an increase &ndash; in her weekly shopping compared with a year ago.  People do not have &euro;30 at their disposal.  This is something that makes a difference in the kind of food, and how much of it, they can put on their tables.<\/p>  <p>  In our motion, Sinn F&eacute;in is making constructive proposals to help people who are struggling and those who are the most vulnerable.

New research has found that 62% of people feel they will have to cut back on food spending over the coming year, with increasing concern that the rising price of food and groceries is forcing many families to go without, as evidenced by the steep increase in the number and range of families now seeking assistance from charities or food banks.  The cost of living has risen so much that people are choosing whether to skip a meal or two just so they can pay utility bills or the rent.  Spiralling housing costs are pushing increasing numbers of people into poverty, with lone parents, people with disabilities and renters depending on housing supports the worst affected.  Data published by the CSO this month state that the overall poverty rate in the State, when housing costs are included, is 19%.  Some 952,185 people - almost 1 million - or one in five of the total population are in poverty.<\/p>  <p>  I will look at my constituency of Meath West as a prime example of what is wrong.  Last week an Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report showed that a lone parent with two children, earning &euro;25,000 per year and living in County Meath will pay a &euro;450 top-off on HAP to his or her landlord, compared with the same families living in neighbouring counties, which are paying &euro;252, or in other cases, &euro;226.  That is an additional &euro;2,500 per year for a lone parent with two kids in County Meath, or an additional 10% of his or her total income.  Surely this is not right or fair?  The HAP system is out of date and has not been updated since 2016.  In Sinn F&eacute;in we want to help families that are stressed with bills.  We would put a month's rent back into renters' pockets, reduce childcare fees by two thirds and increase the minimum wage and social welfare rates.

Food banks are seeing more and more people turning up and looking for help every week.  New research by Permanent TSB found that 62% of people feel they have to cut back on food spending because of the rising costs.

The cost of living crisis is causing serious financial hardship for ordinary families and workers.  Some of this is beyond the control of the Government but some of it is not and this evening, Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing one solution that would provide some relief and a much-needed break.  In response to the most recent surge in the costs in the food sector, we are proposing that those earning less than &euro;30,000 would receive a once-off payment of &euro;200, while those earning over &euro;30,000 and under &euro;60,000 would get &euro;100.  No one should face that choice between putting food on the table or paying essential bills.  Our proposal is an attempt to ease the pressure on those who are most financially exposed.  Sinn F&eacute;in is also calling for other cost-of-living solutions to be implemented.  These include the introduction of a living wage, a rent freeze and a tax rebate of 8.5% for renters, equal to one month's rent.  This Government has done nothing for renters, the most hard-pressed section of society.  We want a discretionary fund to be established to help with utility bills and to provide a cut in childcare costs.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to go further and to start addressing the causes of inflation and what can be done as a country to protect people from external supply chain issues.  A lot of our food is imported and is transported long distances, which results in more energy being used and costs being increased.  Supply issues and global conflicts are driving up prices.  The uncertainty and breakdown in production and supply lines are making the supply of some products problematic.  Part of the solution to inflation and supply issues is more localised production.  We need, therefore, to see greater investment in and focus on organic farming, which only makes up a small percentage, 1.8%, of all agricultural production, despite the fact that we have a target of 7.5% for it.  We also need to re-examine the production of sugar and flour in this country.  Some 80% of our flour and 100% of our sugar are imported, despite the fact, as the Minister of State knows, that we had a State industry producing those products less than two decades ago.  The Government needs to establish a working group to assess the viability of re-establishing those key industries and establishing jobs in them.<\/p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>That should be the long-term plan.

People are contacting my office who are struggling because of the housing crisis, whether that be the lack of housing, sky-high rents or because they are among the thousands languishing on never-ending public housing lists.  In addition, 10,000 people are now homeless, thousands of whom are children.  We are back to 2019 levels of homelessness under this Government.<\/p>  <p>  There are countless parents who are desperately trying to access care for their children, who have been left on waiting lists for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychology services.  Representatives of the Quarryvale food bank, which is located in my area, told the children's committee earlier in the year that people are accessing that service because they have to pay privately for the care for their children that should be provided under the public health service.  This is an absolute disgrace.  Ordinary workers and families are exhausted even before they are hit by the cost-of-living crisis.  No one should ever have to face the choice between putting food on the table or paying the rent.  People are under real pressure.

I understand their motivation in doing so and welcome the opportunity for discussion on the issue of rising food prices.  We are concerned with protecting our people from the severe financial and economic consequences of the recent worldwide spike in inflationary pressure.  We are all aware that people are finding it harder to make ends meet.  All of us in this House, regardless of party affiliation, want to respond as comprehensively as we can.  The Government will not oppose the motion, but I wish to make a number of points on its content and on the Government's record in addressing the cost-of-living issues to date.<\/p>  <p>  With the annual rate of increase in the consumer price index, CPI, standing at 8.2% in May, it is clear that the long period of stable prices has, at least temporarily, come to an end.  This is an issue that is not limited to Ireland.  Indeed, it is a trend that is being seen across most advanced economies in the euro area.  Inflation has reached a record 8.1% in those economies and it is of a similar magnitude in the United States.  The emergence of inflationary pressures over the course of the past year is largely explained by international factors outside the control of the Government and governments elsewhere.  These factors include post-Covid supply chain bottlenecks, increased savings, which people wish to spend now that Covid restrictions are eased, and an increase in wholesale oil and gas prices because of the rapid rebound in global demand.  The war in Ukraine has added to these pressures.<\/p>  <p>  The Government did not wait for a further budget cycle to address these challenges.  Instead, we acted early, earlier in fact than most other governments.  We brought in measures worth &euro;2.4 billion to help this year.  We introduced a package of significant measures in February, costing more than &euro;500 million, that were designed to ease the impact of rising costs on households, particularly those on fixed and low incomes.  These measures included energy credits, excise and VAT reductions on fuel and energy, the extension of the low VAT rate for tourism and hospitality services, a reduction in the caps on school transport fees for multiple children, maintaining the enhancement of the diesel rebate scheme and reducing public transport fees by 20%.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, we took a number of measures targeted specifically at low-income households.  Additional fuel allowance payments were provided in March and May to more than 370,000 households.  The fuel allowance is not designed to pay 100% of a household's fuel costs but it is a substantial contribution from the Exchequer, through the carbon taxes we raise, to those 370,000 households, each of which receives more than &euro;1,000 through the scheme.  The approach of focusing on lower-income households is important as we know they have less capacity to absorb price increases.  That is why we complemented general social welfare and taxation measures in recent budgets with measures specifically designed to help those at risk of poverty.  The social welfare package in budget 2022 was the highest in 14 years, with 1.4 million people receiving a &euro;5 increase in weekly payments, and more if they have dependants or are living alone.  We also introduced a number of targeted measures designed to support those most vulnerable to poverty and the rising cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  Budget measures combined with the February cost-of-living mitigation have significantly increased the incomes of all social welfare household types.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank have indicated these measures have been of particular benefit to the lowest-income households.  Fuel allowance recipients, for example, have seen their payment increase by more than 55%.  I have already indicated the scale of that figure.  The full impact of the measures taken to date has yet to feed through, but the Government will continue to monitor the situation in planning future actions and in preparing for the budget.<\/p>  <p>  I turn now to the proposals in the motion from Sinn F&eacute;in.  The proposal to establish a discretionary fund suggests we do not have one.  In fact, we do.  The community welfare service makes discretionary payments every day of the week to help people with additional costs they cannot reasonably be expected to meet.  These include urgent need payments to people who would not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance, including those in full-time employment.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is not budget-capped; it is demand-led.  While I understand the intent of the proposal, there is no need to establish a separate fund.  Instead, it is intended to increase awareness of the existing scheme through more intensive media communications over the coming weeks.  I want to make the situation clear for people who might not understand the phrase \"demand-led\".  If more people need the payment, that cost will be met by the Exchequer.  There is no cap on the amount that can be paid out through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  If more people need it or there is a need for higher payments, those payments will be made.  There is no cap on the budget for that provision.<\/p>  <p>  The motion asks that walk-in access to the community welfare service be reintroduced.  This suggests there is currently no walk-in access.  In fact, although telephone-based services were introduced as part of the Covid-19 response and are still in place, a community welfare officer is available in all main Intreo centres around the country, during business hours on each working day, for walk-in services.  An officer is also available to attend smaller Intreo centres or branch offices or, indeed, at the person's home in emergency situations.  The telephone contact service operates alongside the in-person service.  This means citizens no longer have to meet in person with a community welfare officer to make a claim.  Indeed, many claims can be taken and decided over the phone.  In many of these situations, as Deputies know, the community welfare officer has knowledge of people, their background and situation, and is in a position to make a prompt decision.  Even if there is no meeting in person, a decision can be made once the person is spoken to over the telephone.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal to introduce a three-year refundable tax credit for all existing and new tenancies, which it is claimed would put \"a month's rent back into renters' pockets\", is an old idea and one that would have a significant cost to the Exchequer.  The question we must ask is whether it would, in fact, put money in the right hands.  A previous rental tax relief was abolished in budget 2011.  The view of the independent Commission on Taxation and Welfare was that this relief would increase the cost of private rented accommodation.  In effect, the Exchequer was increasing the income of landlords rather than reducing pressure on tenants.  That is an essential point and I am surprised this proposal is included in the motion.  If the Government introduced such a measure, we would be accused of assisting landlords and developers by providing more funds to that sector.  As Deputies know, it would result in putting more income in the hands of landlords.<\/p> <p>It would actually result in putting more income in the hands of landlords.  There is a real risk that pumping more money into the rental sector in this way will just inflate prices and will not help renters.<\/p> <p> The Housing for All strategy sets out a target to deliver 33,000 new units per annum.  The application of Exchequer resources to support housing, should, in the first instance, be used to fund this new housing.  In the 12 months to the end of March, over 22,000 new homes were completed.  This year, the Government's target is 24,600 homes.  We recognise that there are ongoing challenges to the delivery of housing but we are confident that this plan can deliver and we are completely focused on its implementation.<\/p> <p> The Government acknowledges that fees for early learning and childcare can place a financial strain on families and has already set out a range of actions to address this issue.  Significant progress has already been made.  More than 100,000 children now avail of two years of preschool education each year under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and the national childcare scheme provides subsidies to more than 80,000 children.  Findings from a recent review reveal that people using the scheme have saved money - 38% have saved at least half of their childcare costs- are making greater use of early learning and childcare services, and are working more hours themselves.  The Government is committed to continuing to invest in this scheme with spending to increase to at least &euro;1 billion this year.<\/p> <p> Ireland has one of the highest rates of minimum wage in the EU, which is good.  In addition, the share of workers on or below the minimum wage as a percentage of the total workforce has reduced from over 9% to about 6% in quarter 4 of 2020.  Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, the national minimum wage has increased by 21%.  This compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the six years to December 2021.  We acknowledge that prices have increased substantially since then.  The Government is supportive of the Low Pay Commission and believes that changes to the minimum rate should be informed by the work of this commission.<\/p> <p> Future actions should complement these measures and build on the services already in place, rather than set up parallel or duplicate streams of work.  That is not to say that we believe no further measures are necessary.  The Government has not been found wanting and will continue to monitor the situation.  We will take on board the advice of bodies such as the Low Pay Commission and the suggestions from this House to respond appropriately at the right time, as we have done to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100038#NN00300","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654022400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I listened to the Minister of State's speech.

I will call her Anne.  She has two children and is renting.  The landlord said he was selling the house and she needed to go elsewhere.  She could either go to a place that would not take housing assistance payment, HAP, or get nowhere.  Because she ended up with a landlord who would not take HAP, that resulted in a 35% increase in her rent.  She works in a fast-food chain on minimum wage.  She is trying to raise two children, one of whom is on the autism spectrum with all the additional costs that come with that.  Her experience is the same as that of thousands of others who are in desperate situations.  The cost-of-living crisis is grinding them into the ground.  This woman told me that some days of the week they eat beans because there is nothing else.  If she does not do that, she will not have enough to pay the rent.<\/p>  <p>  We need to find means to address that type of situation, other than telling people to go to the community welfare officer.  She has gone to the community welfare officer several times when there were other crises and she knows that she will be refused if she keeps going back there.  The reality is that we cannot treat people in this manner.  We need to recognise that poverty is real for these people.  The only way we can deal with it is to ensure we have adequate support for them and move these people into better employment on proper wages.  While the Government can talk about the minimum wage increasing, the reality is that the minimum wage is a trap in poverty for most of them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the fuel allowance and other things.  Most of those are for people who, unfortunately, are in receipt of social welfare and have no other option.  Many of us meet other people who are not on social welfare and are in low-paid jobs.  They are also in a trap, trying to raise a family, trying to pay mortgages or rent, and caught in a situation they simply cannot get out of.  We need action from Government.

Even before the most recent increases in the cost of living, the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth was examining child poverty.  Guests presented to the committee on the increase in the use of food banks.  There is an impact on children when they do not get access to the proper and basic three meals a day.  It is a reality for many families and children.<\/p>  <p>  Let us think about that for a second.  How would any of us feel if our children or our family's children were going to school hungry or with no lunch?  In some cases, parents may be making the decision not to send their child to school because they know they do not have the lunch to put in their bags and do not want them to be embarrassed.  The costs of school trips have increased.  There is pressure on children to try to pretend that everything is okay in their world when they are struggling.  There is an impact on children if they are not getting adequate food and nutrition.  We all know that is not good for learning.  It is not good if children are going into school cold or if they are trying to do their homework where there is not adequate heating.  Perhaps they do not have access to all the things they need, including broadband and everything else.  Many people take those things for granted.<\/p>  <p>  We need to stop for a second and think about what we are talking about.  We are talking about children here.  We are talking about very young children who are seriously struggling.  Parents are under serious pressure.  They are heartbroken that they cannot provide food and facilities for their children.  Perhaps they cannot provide the right books, uniforms, coats or shoes.

I will start by responding to the Minister's response to the point that is raised in the motion about the establishment of a discretionary fund.  It is true to say that the community welfare service makes discretionary payments and nobody would argue against that.  What worries me, however, is the fact that the number of people who are receiving payments is not very high, especially with regard to exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments.  In a response I received directly from the Minister, I was told that in 2021, more than 2,300 exceptional needs payments amounting to &euro;750,000 were made to assist with household bills and heating costs.  To the end of March of this year, some 780 exceptional needs payments amounting to &euro;167,000 had been made across the entire State to assist with household bills and heating costs.<\/p>  <p>  Most of us in this House have been around a long time.  We all deal with CWOs and the Department of Social Protection but something is not computing in respect of the volume of figures I have shared.  I have noticed a trend in the past five or six years, while also noting the excellent work that individual CWOs do for their clients, service users and people who come to them, in exercising their discretion.  We do not have the exact evidence for my assertion yet but one hopes one's political gut hopefully serves one well.  A centralising tendency is creeping into the Department of Social Protection, which is trying to reduce the number of payments that are going out under the supplementary welfare allowance or through exceptional needs payments and urgent need payments.  People's access to those payments is being suppressed.  That is not happening at CWO level, but when dealing with people who come to my office, I find I am more often ringing the 0818 number.  There is increasingly a suppression of that human interaction between the person who is applying and the deciding officer.  The point is that I believe strongly that the Department is by stealth trying to take the discretionary element out of those key payments.  We agree they exist but we also agree, now we are all interacting with each other again, that we need to go back to a model whereby people can have a walk-in service.  That is what we are talking about.  We want the walk-in service to be resumed.  We need the element of discretion to be embedded into the structures again.<\/p>  <p>  I do not understand why applications are more often going up the line to somebody who has no relationship whatsoever with the applicant or has not had a human interaction with the applicant.  It runs contrary to the foundations of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme as it was established by former Deputy Frank Cluskey all those years ago.  We need to go back to that.  There is unmet demand out there.  People find it difficult to engage directly and increasingly we, as Deputies, are interfacing to try to contextualise people's individual stories.  We all know what the stories are.  We know exactly where people are struggling.  It is well evidenced at this stage and is plain for everybody to see.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just people who depend on the Department of Social Protection for their income who are struggling.  The working poor are also struggling.  We need to find some mechanism, through schemes such as the supplementary welfare allowance, for example, to provide for a greater number of urgent needs payments.  I am poring over numbers.  In October 2021, 24 urgent needs payments were made, if the figures I received in response to a parliamentary question are to be believed and we take the figures provided by the Department absolutely at face value.  In November, 36 such payments were made.  In December, 38 were made.  In January, 26 were made.  In February, 25 were made.  In March, there was an upward spike to 45.  Those are the figures for urgent needs payments, which is a specific category.  Those numbers worry me.  I can conclude there is a deliberate suppression in the number of people who are applying and refused payments.  We do not have those figures but they will come out in due course, I am sure, when the right questions are asked.  The alternative conclusion is that the level of discretion has been taken away.  Neither God nor man could convince me that in March only 45 people throughout the country applied specifically for urgent needs payments.  That is based on a reply to a parliamentary question I received lately.  If I am misquoting figures, somebody will correct me.  I am happy to be corrected, but I have the information here in black and white.<\/p>  <p>  We keep raising the issue of the fuel allowance and access to it.  I know it is not the most important topic during these summer months.  However, it will not be long until we are into the autumn and winter months again and the issue will be high on the political agenda.<\/p> <p>I have called previously in this House for some sort of scheme to be put in place for certain people.  While it is acknowledged that there has been an increase in the fuel allowance for those in receipt of it, there is a whole category of people who have worked all their lives, put children through college and are living in C-, D- and E-rated houses.  They do not have access to grants and do not have the means to upgrade their houses, but they could very well do with an additional supplementary payment for fuel.  If the Government were to create a second category to encapsulate those people who have a modest occupational pension or a contributory pension and who do not meet the criteria for access to the fuel allowance, it would be a good day's work.<\/p> <p> Very many of the people to whom I refer, because they are of a certain age, would have voted Fianna F&aacute;il historically.  It would be a fair assessment to extrapolate that they have probably turned away from Fianna F&aacute;il but maybe Fianna F&aacute;il could go back and look at that category of people, if at all possible.  I urge the Green Party and Fine Gael to do the same because this is all coming into sharp relief at a time when there is a fuel crisis.  That is a very obvious thing to say but if it is possible to create a second category for the fuel allowance that would encapsulate far more people, that would give them just a little bit of headroom and see them through the next winter.  The same Minister of State was in the House the last time I raised this during the debate on a previous motion.  I hope to address the line Minister with policy responsibility for this in due course as well.  We have to look after those people.  They made the biggest sacrifices in this country in the 1970s and 1980s when they paid big money in taxation and still they were able to educate children and put them through college.  I am probably a product of that system, dare I say it.<\/p> <p> I support the motion.  It is a worthwhile motion but we must look again at the role of the community welfare officer.  We need to buttress that facility.  The community welfare officers that I deal with know the people they are dealing with well.  They know the personalities and they are embedded within their communities.  The level of discretion they have is paramount and is key to protecting people and we need to go back to that, back to the well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100040#PP00300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654023600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The rising cost of living, especially as it relates to the cost of food, is an incredibly serious issue affecting households across Ireland.  I thank Deputy Kerrane and Sinn F&eacute;in for the opportunity to discuss this important matter and for the practical and considered solutions they are offering.<\/p>  <p>  Rising energy costs, skyrocketing rents, childcare fees that are more expensive than mortgages and families forced to pay for expensive private healthcare because public services are practically non-existent are all contributing to the cost-of-living crisis.  Recent research from Permanent TSB has found that over 60% of people feel they will have to cut back on food spending in the coming year due to the cost-of-living crisis.  Social Justice Ireland has shown that when housing costs are counted, almost one in five people in Ireland is living in poverty.  This is the perfect storm.  Decades of underinvestment in State services by successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments, combined with the failure to tackle the housing crisis, have left households exposed.  Now the energy crisis and looming food crisis have pushed very many people to breaking point.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the steps taken by the Government.  The reductions in excise duty supported by most of the D&aacute;il, cuts to public transport fees and cuts and an improved drugs payment scheme are all welcome but in many cases these and other measures, such as social welfare increases, were long overdue anyway.  The Social Democrats have repeatedly proposed measures such as a ban on rent increases, increases to the national minimum wage, a &euro;300 refundable tax credit to those on incomes below &euro;50,000 and a further increase in core social welfare rates.  Families need temporary measures to address the current crisis but more substantially, they need a fundamental reform of our State services to address the real issues underlying the cost of living.  We are in desperate need of a Government that will tackle housing, childcare and healthcare costs, including for those with disabilities and long-term illnesses.  If we want to improve people's quality of life and put money back into their pockets, then there must be a comprehensive and strategic approach to addressing the chronic deficits that exist in our public services.<\/p>  <p>  In our alternative budget we proposed the concept of universal basic services and the idea that everyone is entitled to a range of public services that are free at the point of use.  In progressive societies there is a minimum standard of living below which nobody should fall.  This is the social contract.  In return for the rates of tax people pay, the very least they should expect is a decent level of public service.  Sick and elderly people should be able to get a bed in a public hospital, children with disabilities should get the therapies they desperately need, families should have affordable childcare and all communities should have access to affordable and frequent public transport.  These are basic standards.  They are the least people should expect, but, due to continued underinvestment, understaffing and dependence on families or private means, our State services are so insufficient it makes life more expensive for ordinary people every day.  Rent, medical expenses, education costs, and childcare fees all underlie the current cost-of-living crisis.  To ease the burden on households, there must be a new approach to public services.<\/p>  <p>  The housing and rental crisis is getting worse, adding increasing financial and psychological burdens on already hard-pressed families.  The number of people in emergency accommodation surpassed 10,000 in April, including almost 3,000 children but in reality we know the homeless figures are even higher.  In the past eight years, house prices have doubled.  They have increased by more than 12% in the past year alone.  Rents have also doubled in a decade, while housing costs have skyrocketed.  We are seeing a growing number of people stuck renting who would like to be able to afford to buy their own home.  We are seeing house prices about to reach record levels, surpassing their Celtic tiger peak.  Home ownership levels are in free fall under this Government and home ownership among adults of prime working age, between 25 and 54, has collapsed, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Young people and families are being priced out of the rental market and home ownership is a pipe dream for many.  The Government's response has been wholly inadequate.  Renters cannot continue to pay more and more.  We have some of the highest rents in the European Union which are a major cost for individuals and families and are also a significant economic cost.  We need a radical increase in the supply of cost-rental and affordable homes to meet the housing needs of people, as well as a ban on rent increases and improvements in security of tenure for renters.<\/p>  <p>  Childcare costs range on average from &euro;800 to &euro;1,350 per month, per child.  This often forces a parent - invariably the mother - to reduce her involvement in or leave employment.  At the same time, childcare workers are very poorly paid and retention in the sector is extremely difficult.  The problem stems from underinvestment in children by successive Governments for decades.  Core funding for early learning and care and for school going children is so inadequate that families have to sacrifice just to get by.  The  State spends just 0.3% of GDP on early years, which is well below the European average of 0.8% and the UNICEF recommended benchmark of 1%.  This underinvestment is felt most acutely by one-parent families and those in disadvantage.  This underinvestment is not only a substantial component of the cost of living for young families, it also perpetuates inequality.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of living is even higher for disabled people.  The Cost of Disability in Ireland research report, which was commissioned by the Government, revealed that people with disabilities face extra costs of up to &euro;12,300 annually for transport, fuel, equipment, aids, medical expenses and much more.  As a result, Ireland has one of the highest rates of poverty and social exclusion for disabled people in the EU.  The Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme is failing children and their families.  Waiting lists for assessments and therapies mean that private services are the only hope of intervention for some families.  This forces parents to make impossible financial choices and sacrifices, while for others it is simply not an option and they can only stand by as their child is denied vital therapies and supports.  Those with the means to pay for private services do so and those who cannot afford it are just left on those never-ending waiting lists.<\/p> <p>The situation is no different for adults with disabilities.  The Ombudsman's report criticising personal transport supports described the available scheme as \"inadequate, unfair and inequitable\".  This failure increases social isolation and reduces employment opportunities.  There is a need for targeted, social health interventions to enable people with disabilities to live independent lives.<\/p> <p> This motion's focus on food is incredibly important.  Too often it is forgotten that food is a matter of public policy, just like education, transport and housing.  The availability, cost and quality of food are all shaped by Government and EU policy.  Food prices are rising.  This hits all households.  We are seeing more families having to turn to food banks.  These fantastic organisations provide vital work but they are indicative of the poverty so many people face.  Parents are forgoing meals in order to ensure that their children are fed.  Families are cutting back on groceries to pay rent.  This is deeply worrying.  It is simply wrong and it is incredibly unhealthy.  The least we should expect in a wealthy country is that all people should have access to sufficient healthy food.<\/p> <p> Our current food system benefits larger processors and retail giants, not normal people and certainly not producers.  While food prices are rising, producers are not making more.  Small farmers, inshore fishers and small producers are barely getting by.  The Government spends hundreds of millions of euro annually subsidising food production, but how much of that actually benefits farmers and consumers?  We are all aware of cartel-like practices in some areas of the agricultural sector.  Farmers are entirely dependent on processors and factories for prices, which often bear no relation to production costs.<\/p> <p> A food system that respects farmers and fishers, and helps consumers to access healthy foods produced as locally as possible, benefits ordinary people at both ends of the process: farmers and consumers.  For too long, large retailers and processors have controlled the sector by setting prices, changing contracts, and simply operating for their gain only.  Food is fundamental.  It is a basic need that shapes our health and well-being.  We need much greater regulation of our food system.  We need fair prices for food producers and affordability for families.<\/p> <p> This motion for a proposed cost-of-living cash payment is a practical and much-needed intervention that would help to alleviate the burdens on families and ordinary people until we get a Government that is willing to systematically take on the vested interests and reform our State public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100041#QQ00200","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from the Standing Business Committee of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann","time":1654024200,"counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100042#RR00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1654024200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The Business Committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has completed its consideration under Standing Order 30 of the request by Deputy Jennifer Whitmore to waive the requirement for scrutiny of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2021 by the relevant committee and has agreed thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100042#RR00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Rising Food Prices: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1654024200,"counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100042#RR00400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654024200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Clare Kerrane:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1654024200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kerrane of Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion, which we support.  Any contribution to people who are being absolutely hammered with cost-of-living increases should be welcomed.  We are happy to support the motion.<\/p>  <p>  I want to set out what I believe needs to be a really comprehensive and radical package to deal with the inflation and cost-of-living crisis that people are enduring.  There is a need for us to recognise that something is rotten in the way our economic system operates.  If we do not get to the bottom of that, we are not going to either solve this problem or stop lurching from crisis to crisis, which is what we do.  We do that because we allow the market to dictate what happens in our society, with commercial concerns coming before planning for the needs of society.<\/p>  <p>  Consider the mess at Dublin Airport.  That is a Covid-related supply chain bottleneck according to the Government.  When it replies to our criticism, the Government says that it is not its fault and that it is a Covid-related supply chain bottleneck.  This was what the Minister of State said  What does that actually mean?  I believe it is just jargon and rubbish to try to cover up what is actually happening.  I will outline what it actually means.  The CEO of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, was previously head of Brown Thomas.  It baffles me what those two things have to do with each other.  Somebody who used to run Brown Thomas is running the DAA.  Another person who is running it is a former Goldman Sachs banker.  They are running the DAA and during Covid they said they were going to get rid of 1,000 workers because not as many people were travelling as used to be the case.  They decided to take advantage of that opportunity to get rid of people.  They knew they would have to rehire them.  When they knew it was time to do so, they would have taken a decision to give them absolutely rubbish contracts in order that they can have a workforce that can be turned on and off like a tap.  They would also have to decided to guarantee those people only 20 hours' work a week but with the proviso that they must be on call for 40.  Furthermore, they would have decided to pay them &euro;14 per hour.  Is it any wonder that people are not exactly jumping over themselves for those jobs or that the DAA has a problem retaining people in them?  The DAA wants to hire people but does not want to pay them properly.  It wants a workforce it can turn on and turn off.  That is what a supply chain bottleneck looks like.  It is people running our most important piece of national transport infrastructure on a for-profit basis at the expense of the workers who are needed to make the place function.  The workers are treated like dirt, which is phrased as being \"flexible\", but, of course, eventually workers just do not want to do that.  The people at the top have awarded themselves packages of &euro;366,000 in pay and pension entitlements.  They have also decided to run two airports down in Saudi Arabia for one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world, and are setting up duty-free shops all over the world.  This is because they are interested in money.  They are not interested in making our infrastructure work; they are interested in money.<\/p>  <p>  Does this sound familiar in the context of some of the other things affecting the cost of living, such as, for example, the cost of housing, accommodation and rent?  The people running that sector are interested in making money out of it.  If there is a shortage of housing, they actually make more money.  In fact, they have absolutely no interest in creating a situation where there might be either a sufficient supply or and excess of housing.  Why would they possibly do that when, if they did, they would not make as much money?  That is how our housing sector works.<\/p>  <p>  One can also go through the list of areas where it is about people making money rather than supplying food, as was just mentioned.  Our entire system of agriculture has been set up to supply export markets, which is a global market-led approach, rather than meeting the need for food and a diversity of food supply, which would be necessary to deliver locally-produced food of all types to the people of this country on a sustainable and secure basis.  No.  We are geared up for the market and we are geared up for the beef barons and certain people who control the dairy sector to make money.  It does not work for the producers and it does not work for the ordinary consumers, but by God does it work for the beef barons, for Tesco and for all of the rest of them.  That is the elephant in the room.  While ordinary people are hammered with the cost-of-living crisis, Tesco's profits, energy companies' profits, Shell's profits, BP's profits and corporate profits generally in Ireland are all through the roof.  That is what is going on.  Inflation is not some sort of interesting economic phenomenon.  Inflation is about making money for the people who control the things that we need to make our society function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100042#RR00500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1654024200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>That is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100042#RR00600","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1654024200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>That is what it is about.

Will the cost-of-living crisis lead to an increase in the number of people who steal food from shops in order to eat or provide for their families?  If so, how will the law react?  Will people be prosecuted?  In Britain, there is public debate around this question.  Why is there no such debate here?  Earlier this month, the new chief inspector of the constabulary in England and Wales, Andy Cooke, said the cost-of-living crisis will trigger an increase in crime and that officers should use their discretion in deciding whether to prosecute people who steal in order to eat.  The following day, his views were challenged by Tory Minister Kit Malthouse, who said that crime causes poverty, not <i>vice versa<\/i>, and urged prosecutions.<\/p><p>I believe crimes are being committed in our supermarkets, by the billionaire owners of the major chains.  I believe it is criminal for Tesco to make profits of &euro;2.2 billion, pre-tax, in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in 2021, which is double the profits for 2020, at a time when some people are unable to feed their families or are forced to choose between heating and eating.  It is not illegal for these chains to charge the prices they charge but it should be.  The Government should make it so by using its powers under sections 61 and 62 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 to control prices.<\/p><p>I also do not believe a parent who steals a packet of nappies for their child should be prosecuted.  To be crystal clear, I am not advocating for shoplifting; I am opposing prosecution in cases such as those I have outlined.  Having said that, if things keep going the way they are going, I wonder whether the &quot;Can't pay, won't pay&quot; movement from 1970s Italy, where people loaded their trolleys and walked out of supermarkets as an organised group without paying the price increases might not happen here in the future.  In the meantime, I advocate for a different form of mass protest.  I hope people take to the streets in large numbers to demand a &euro;15 minimum wage, a freeze on food prices and legislation to cut rents.  They will have opportunities in Dublin, Cork and around the country on 18 June.  I hope workers put in claims for pay increases that match inflation and back that up with ballots for industrial action.  Inflation is class warfare, with the rich robbing the poor.

Hundreds of thousands of families are living from overdraft to overdraft and many others are completely maxed out.  Families are going without food and heat.  Energy prices are sky-rocketing.  It is incredible that people are spending time awake at night trying to work out what bill they can afford to pay and how they will make ends meet.  Some of the advice we have gotten from the Government in response to this is incredible.  Ministers have told us to drive slowly and shop around.  Today, inflation hit 8.2% in this State.  That is an incredible level.  That money is coming out of the people's pockets.<\/p><p>There are obviously a number of reasons for this, some of which are international and beyond the control of the Government, but many are local and in the control of the Government.  It is interesting that the Government is now blaming Covid supply chains for some of the breakdowns leading to this inflation.  This Government imposed the longest and most severe lockdowns on supply chains in all of Europe.  The Government's policies led directly, in many ways, to the crisis people are now experiencing in their pockets.  The Government is in control of the fuel issue as well.  Over 50% of the price of a litre of fuel is Government tax.  The higher price the fuel goes, the more the Government makes.  Last year, the Government made &euro;1.5 billion extra in VAT as a result of the increased cost of fuel.  The Minister of State is refusing to look at VAT on fuel.  He said the Government's hands are tied by the EU on this but the Government did not feel the same reticence in reducing VAT on hotels, for example.  There was no problem with that.  Some in that sector are now gouging tourists and locals alike with regard to prices.  The profits and turnovers of many energy firms are rocketing.  Some of these are local, including the ESB.  The ESB made a profit of &euro;679 million up to December 2021.  It is a State-owned company and yet it is still increasing the price of electricity for consumers.  The Government, as the majority shareholder of the ESB, could ask it to reduce the pressure on families but it will not.<\/p><p>Last week, Aont&uacute; raised the issue of the M50 tolls.  If there was ever a monument to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael waste, it has to be the two toll bridges on the M50.  They were built at a cost of &euro;58 million in a public-private partnership signed off on by P&aacute;draig Flynn, who, it later became known from a tribunal, received a donation from the successful company.  That company charged tolls on those bridges for years.  It recouped the cost of building those toll bridges in just one year.  It then sold those bridges to the State for &euro;600 million, after making a massive profits on it.  Since 2009, the Government has recouped &euro;1.3 billion on these tolls on the busiest road in the country.  This Government is in charge of that.  It could reduce the pressure on families by reducing or scrapping that toll but it will not.<\/p><p>Regarding food prices, today's farm inflation is tomorrow's consumer inflation.  Last year, the price of fertiliser increased by 149%.  Now 78% of farmers are going to reduce the amount of fertiliser they use.  This is coupled with the fact that the price of cattle coming into farm has increased by 22% and feed prices are going up.  Even before this inflation came into being, farmers were barely making a living in this country.  Aont&uacute; has asked for the Government to subsidise fertiliser prices but it has refused to do so.  As a result, after this harvest, the increased prices in the inputs of farming will mean increased prices on the shelves for consumers.  In all these situations, the Government is refusing to act.  Before this inflation crisis hit, this State was the sixth most expensive country in Europe, and Dublin the fourth most expensive city, because the Government will not reform the sectors that are maximising profits.  Even when the Troika were here, they pointed the finger at closeted sectors the Government would not reform.  There is a <i>laissez-faire<\/i>attitude from this Government when it comes to fixing the cost of living and that <i>laissez-faire<\/i>attitude is costing people dearly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100043#SS00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1654024800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion, allowing us time to highlight the increasing price of food and how that problem has been made worse by Government actions.  I again feel it is necessary to draw attention to the increase in carbon tax as one of the causes of price increases everywhere, including for food.  To take it from its origin, the farmers who sow the crops have been hit with increased fuel costs via the carbon tax.  Farmers are also faced with higher costs on the shelves because what they buy in the agricultural shop or hardware shop has increased in cost due to higher transport costs, caused in part by carbon taxes.  Before ever sowing the crop, it is more expensive to plough, harrow and prepare for sowing.  The carbon tax also makes it more expensive to sow, maintain and harvest everything.  It is then more expensive for those transporting the produce to the factories and the mills.  When the final products are produced, it is more expensive to transport them to wholesalers and retailers all over the country.  All those extra costs are paid by the consumer when they take the finished item from the shelf and bring it to the cash register.  Food costs are rising by 7.5% year on year.  As I said before, it is the poorest people who are hit hardest by this.  They are the ones who have to make tough choices but they are also the least likely to be able to afford the green alternatives.  There are struggles in different sectors.  The pigmeat sector has been particularly vocal in expressing its troubles, with pig feed costs almost doubling in the last two years.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Scrapping carbon taxes would help significantly to reduce the costs, not only of fuel but of everything that has to be transported using that fuel, that is, not just the food on the table but the clothes on our backs and the shoes on our feet.  It would also ease the cost burden faced by everyone who has to travel for work, such as rural Ireland dwellers, our home carers and tradespeople travelling hundred of miles to build the accommodation so badly needed in our cities.  Social Justice Ireland has highlighted that the overall poverty rate has increased from 11.6% to 19% - not a statistic to be proud of.<br\/><br\/>There is a need to call out the Government's hypocrisy when it comes to its attitude to dealing with the cost of living crisis and blaming the EU rules.  We have heard umpteen times the Government using EU rules as an excuse not to reduce VAT on fuel or heating oil, yet when it comes to the rights of people with disabilities, the Government continues to ignore the rules of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to ensure compliance.  It seems, therefore, that we can ignore our commitments when it suits the Government and apply rules that suit the Government to the detriment of our citizens.<br\/><br\/>Another issue caused by Government actions is the transient accommodation crisis.  I received an email from a representative of the company Mastiff, based in Taghmon, County Wexford.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\t  \tOver the last few weeks we have faced a number of issues with meeting contracts due to the lack of accommodation and the cost of what is available.  We cannot expect our workers to pay the best part of their daily wage on accommodation.  We also cannot expect these men to travel 2-4 hours home at the end of the day and return for work in the morning with a 7-8am start, this would not be safe practice.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>There are workers now refusing to go to work due to the cost and we are unable to increase the contribution, we must operate within revenue guidelines.  This will have an impact on the market and we are seeing steady growth in our sector, this summer will be very busy and this is a concern now as there will be the added issue of tourism and students looking for housing throughout the season.  <\/blockquote> <p>Mastiff is a wholly Wexford-owned and based company, employing 110 people, and its contribution is invaluable to the construction sector.<br\/><br\/>If the Government reduced its tax take on fuel to reflect the emergency situation by removing excise duties and other duties and applying VAT to the product only at the base rate in the short term, 1 l of petrol and diesel would cost &euro;1.12 and &euro;1.28, respectively, tomorrow morning.  That would be radical, meaningful action to combat the soaring cost of living and to prevent people from not being able to afford to go to work or from having to decide between heating and eating.

Whether they are dairy or beef farmers or tillage farmers, the savage extra cost of diesel alone and the considerable cost of fertiliser are driving production costs through the roof.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should and could take less tax from fuel.  It has been raking it in since the base cost increased.  Other countries are taking less tax.  Why can the Government not do the same?  It is not fair on people who have to pay to go on the road, that is, every man or woman with a wheel.  They are paying savage costs and it will not be long until they are ground to a halt.  The Government could take less tax and that would help.  We have to start somewhere, and as the teacher said to me long ago when I was in school, when you are unravelling a stocking, you should begin at the toe.  We have to begin where the trouble started and that is with the increased costs, which have to be reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of electricity is also driving everything mad and it has increased every day since the Government closed Bord na M&oacute;na.  The Government stonewalled and said it would have to get permission from the EU to reduce VAT on fuel, but no permission was needed when VAT was being increased.  I have never heard of the Government having to go to the EU for permission to increase VAT, yet it had to ask the EU, or so it claimed, to be allowed to bring it down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100044#TT00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1654025400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I too thank Deputy Kerrane and Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing this very important motion before the House.  The public are facing unprecedentedly hard times, with inflation at a record high at 8.2% in this month of May.  We would have to go back to 1983 to find similar inflation figures here previously.  If the Government were seriously to consider reducing the taxes that have been put on diesel and petrol, we could reduce the cost of fuel by 65%.  Doing that is within the gift and the power of the Government and it would be meaningful and real and would have a major and immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of this debate on the price of food, I have been the owner of a small shop for many years and I know at first hand the effect the increases are having.  We are living in a country where nothing can be distributed or taken around.  Nothing falls out of the sky for us; it all has to go by road.  Obviously, there has been a massive increase in the costs of transportation, whether that is the fuel itself or the running costs of lorries and vans.  Even for people who deliver newspapers every day, there is a cost to keep tyres and a vehicle maintained and on the road.  It is a never-ending cycle of increases and at the end of the day it is the consumer who pays for everything.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach admitted earlier that he was worried and concerned.  If he is so bloody well concerned, why does he come into the House and put more taxes, in the guise of carbon taxes, onto the hard-pressed public?  Now is not a time to be putting on carbon taxes and other additional taxes.  It is a time to reduce, as a temporary measure, the taxes we have in place to ensure people will be able to afford to live, feed their families and keep bread on the table.  We definitely have to do something, yet the Government seems to be hell-bent on nailing everybody to the cross.  It has done nothing about the increase in energy costs.  People's fuel bills have rocketed to unprecedented figures and there are also the issues faced by people running small businesses.

They tell me the margin on the products they buy into their shop are down by 5% but that their running costs mean they will now have slimmer profit margins than those which they had last year, even though they are turning over more money.  The Government has done nothing about this but increased taxes.  That is where the price increases in all the shops stem from.  The increase in transport costs has resulted in an increase in the cost of producing food, and the answer of the Government, which was elected to protect the people, is one of tax.

Families are under huge pressure because they must struggle to pay these costs for basics but they are also struggling to pay electricity bills, fuel bills and so forth.  I understand from reports on this issue that the cost of food across the EU has jumped by 7.1% in the past year.  That is almost double the rate of inflation of 3.6% in the EU-27, according to the figures released on 2 June by EUROSTAT, which is the EU's statistics office.<\/p>  <p>  We need concrete actions from the Minister of State.  The Rural Independent Group called for a mini budget to try to alleviate some of the hardship for people and we again call on the Government to do just that because people cannot wait until the budget in October.  We are also confronted by the fact that getting things right in this area is an extremely difficult balancing act because as many of us in the Rural Independent Group have been highlighting for some time, although the cost of food is rising, farmers and producers continue to see below-cost selling as standard practice.  It is a vicious circle.  The farmer and producer experience massive hikes in the form of input costs, fertiliser price increases, green diesel and other agri contractor-related expenses but when they go to sell their goods, they continue to receive below the cost in return.  Last week I called for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to look at the carbon tax on agri-diesel.  I support the call of the Association of Farm &amp;amp; Forestry Contractors in Ireland to exempt agri-diesel from carbon tax for five years in order to allow the sector to stabilise, because there are huge pressures there.<\/p>  <p>  This motion calls on the Government to introduce a cost-of-living cash payment of &euro;200 for every adult with an income of less than &euro;30,000 and &euro;100 for every adult with an income of between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000.  I called for something similar many months ago when I suggested the Government revisit extending the children's allowance to all children over the age of 18 years who remain in full-time second level schooling.

I have been at stalls in my constituency over the last couple of weeks to build for the demonstration on 18 June by the Cost of Living Coalition.  There is much anger and frustration from workers and people on social welfare.  I was talking to a young woman who has two children.  She said she has been really impacted by the rise in the cost of her shop.  She made the point that a pack of toilet roll that was &euro;2.90 up to a couple of weeks ago has now gone up to &euro;5.20.  Another young woman and her husband work in the hospitality sector and are low-paid workers.  They have four children and she said her weekly shop has gone up from between &euro;100 and &euro;110 up to around &euro;150.  That is about &euro;45 per week extra, which is more than &euro;2,000 per year on food alone.  That is how the increased cost of living has impacted on them, without taking in energy and the other costs that have gone up.<\/p>  <p>  Many people raised the issue of the &euro;450 million given to developers to do the job they are supposed to do.  People expect the Government to assist people in particular in lower-income households over the next period.<\/p>  <p>  On the radio this morning there was a three-day piece on the cost of living in food shops and the impact on food.  Kantar research stated that 62% of families are cutting back on food and this particular researcher had a receipt from a shop he did this time last year.  He did the exact same shop for the exact same items this year and made the point the shop was up 20%.  He said 454 g of butter, which is a pound of butter, has gone up from &euro;2.19 to &euro;2.99, which is a 36% increase.  The price of 2 l of milk has gone from &euro;1.49 to &euro;1.89, which is a 26% increase.  Chicken has gone up 29%.  These are the real facts people are facing every day of the week while their incomes have not changed, and that is the issue.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government said it is external factors, etc., that have impacted on inflation, it must do more to alleviate the crisis for families.  Food retailers have announced their sales have decreased by 6% in the last 12 weeks.  That means people are cutting back.  Food inflation alone will have gone up at least 8% by the end of the year and possibly even more.  Dr. Michael Drew from St. Vincent de Paul has written a book about the hidden deprivation of food.  He said 350,000 people, which is 7% of the population, are impacted by food poverty.  Social Justice Ireland was also on the radio yesterday.  Its economic researcher, Colette Bennett, made the point the poverty rate is 11.6%, which is 580,000 people, but increases to 19% or 1 million people, when you factor in mortgages and rent payments.  Overall, the poverty rate in owner-occupied homes is one in 12 and for renters it is one in five.  For people with a disability she said the pre-housing poverty rate is 39.1%, which means two in five people with a disability living in poverty.  That increases to more than one in two when you factor in the costs of housing.  These are all realities people are living in at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  Inflation went up by 7% in April and has gone up again this month.  Rents went up by 12%.  Almost 1 million people were forced below the poverty line in the past year when rents are taken into account and an extra 300,000 people found themselves in this position last year.  Everything is going up, including rents, food and energy costs, but the only incomes doing so are those of the already well-paid.  The Government has done very little to alleviate this crisis and working-class families and those on low incomes are being hit the hardest.  The one-off payment for electricity bills was welcome but is not enough.  The reduction in fares is welcome but we should have free public transport if the Government wants to take serious measures to tackle the climate crisis.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot rely on the Minister of State's Government to take serious action.  We need to organise for the minimum wage to be increased and move to a &euro;15 per hour living wage.  The &euro;5 increase in welfare and State pensions in the last budget was an insult.  We need a &euro;10 increase at minimum.  We need to freeze, then lower, rents and ban evictions.  We need to scrap college fees and build public student accommodation.  Importantly - and this is an issue I have raised on a number of occasions - we need a specific emergency hardship fund for those who are struggling with bills.  The community welfare officers should be relocated back into the community for at least two to three days per week to make such payments more accessible.  We need a windfall tax on the super profits of companies in the energy sector to help pay for these measures.  I support the motion brought forward by Deputy Kerrane and appeal to people to come out on the streets on 18 June and put a shot across the bow of this Government to show people cannot tolerate this level of inflation, especially those at the poorest levels, on low incomes and on social welfare payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100045#UU00600","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1654026000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for an engaging discussion on the important issue of rising food prices.  As was already outlined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, I assure Deputies the fundamental objective of the Government's policy approach to this issue is to take action, monitor the impact of those actions, consult bodies such as the Low Pay Commission, take the suggestions of this House on board and then respond appropriately at the right time.<\/p> <p> One of the facets of rising food prices, as part of a wider increase in inflation, is the increased risk of food poverty in our society.  This is an area for which I have both a personal concern and a key responsibility.  In fact, this morning I joined the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to speak at the launch of the book on food poverty that Deputy Joan Collins mentioned.  In respect of rising food prices and food poverty, the roadmap for social inclusion, for which I have responsibility, is a whole-of-government strategy to reduce poverty and reduce social exclusion and marginalisation in Ireland.  The roadmap includes a commitment to develop a comprehensive programme of work to explore further the drivers of food poverty and to identify mitigating actions.  On foot of this, last year I established a working group on food poverty to deliver on this commitment.  I chair the group and the membership comprises representatives from relevant Departments as well as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Crosscare and the Children's Rights Alliance.<\/p> <p> The food poverty working group has focused on two pieces of work to date.  The first is a high-level mapping exercise of programmes, services and supports already in existence across government that are tasked with addressing elements of food poverty and providing supports in this area, including everything from hot school meals to meals-on-wheels.  A key issue for the future is ensuring that these supports are provided in a coherent manner and in locations where they are needed and availed of by people who need them, to ensure that the services operate as effectively and efficiently as possible in mitigating food poverty.  The second piece of work is the development of a research proposal to identify the drivers of food poverty in two case study areas, one urban and one rural, and to examine the range of service providers and actors relating to food poverty in each area.  It should also identify any gaps and overlaps in service provision.  The findings from this research should further inform the delivery of this commitment as part of the roadmap for social inclusion.<\/p> <p> In addition, the Department of Social Protection helps to address food poverty directly through the fund of European aid to the most deprived, FEAD, which supports EU member states' actions to provide food and material assistance to the most deprived.  FEAD Ireland received funding of &euro;26 million for the period 2014 to 2020, with over 150 charities nationwide distributing food to their communities.  The Department also delivers the school meals programme, which provides funding towards the provision of food services to some 1,500 schools and organisations, benefiting 230,000 children.  A budget of over &euro;68 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that the Government is keenly aware of the recent price increases and their impact on households and businesses in Ireland.  For this reason the Government acted early in providing a response package.  The February package was particularly targeted on the impact of rising costs on fixed-income and low-income households.  To summarise, the Government's range of measures included energy credits, excise and VAT reductions on fuel and energy, the extension of the low VAT rate for tourism and hospitality, reducing the caps for multiple children on school transport fees, maintaining the enhancement to the diesel rebate scheme and reducing public transport fees by 20%.  All these measures help all households but are of particular benefit to families on low incomes.  We specifically targeted low-income households through additional fuel allowance payments which were provided in March and May, &euro;125 and &euro;100 lump sums, respectively, to over 370,000 qualifying low-income households.  The overall fuel allowance increase for 2022 has been &euro;355, bringing the total annual payment for fuel allowance to &euro;1,139 per eligible household.<\/p> <p> This approach of focusing measures so that they benefit lower-income households is important, as we know that these households have less capacity to absorb price increases.  To the extent that prices of basic goods such as food are increasing, these households are more vulnerable to risk of poverty and deprivation than other households.  These measures maintain the trend supported by Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research of complementing general tax and social protection measures with specific measures designed to support those at higher risk of poverty.  The full impact of the measures taken to date has yet to feed through, but the Government will continue to monitor the situation, both nationally and internationally, including price developments, in planning future actions and in preparing for the budget.  We intend, as we have to date, to complement broader-based welfare and tax changes with targeted measures to support the most vulnerable households at highest risk of poverty.<\/p> <p> To conclude, I thank the Members for their time and engagement this evening.  It is important to ensure that these issues remain a focus of all Members of the House during a unique period of rising inflation both nationally and internationally.  I assure Members that all suggestions and proposals will receive due consideration as the Government continues to respond to the unfolding situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100045#UU00700","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654026600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I do not have to tell the Minister of State that the cost of living is affecting people from all walks of life.  People are struggling with the rising cost of rent, the cost of trying to buy a house, the price of fuel and the rising cost of food.  Social Justice Ireland has found that almost 1 million people are living in poverty in the State while the Central Statistics Office, CSO, predicts a dramatic rise in the amount of money people will have to spend on food over the next year.  The CSO estimates an additional &euro;780 will be spent on groceries next year by consumers due to the cost of living.  This is a huge increase for those on lower incomes and those depending on State support payments such as the old age pension.  When it is coupled with other excessive prices for electricity and gas it is an increase that cannot be managed.<\/p>  <p>  People in my city often turn to Depaul Ireland, the Simon Community and the wonderful community centres we have across the city.  For example, St. Munchin's Community Centre on the north side of Limerick prepares and ensures that hundreds of meals are distributed in the city and across the region every day.  While this was very evident during the pandemic, the work continues daily.  People would be lost without these vital community services.  They would literally be going hungry.<\/p>  <p>  People are looking to the Government for solutions or support, but very little of either has been offered.  The Government has often been far too slow to react.  Rents have been allowed to spiral out of control, with a 14.1% increase experienced by renters in my city of Limerick, and childcare and energy costs are through the roof.  The Government's response has been haphazard, untargeted and unambitious.  Time and again we have called for the Government to introduce supports for households that are struggling with rising costs.  We want those struggling to be aided by the State with a real intervention and we want to put workers and families first.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time I have, I will refer to a comment that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, made.  I was not surprised to hear the Minister of State say it earlier because I often hear Ministers say that people can contact their local community welfare office.  I can tell exactly what happens when that is said.  First, the staff will be overwhelmed with the number of presentations they get.  The staff tell me this happens every time a Minister spouts this in the D&aacute;il or in the media.  Second, little, if any, payment will be made to them.

That is not an accident.  Farm input costs have been increasing dramatically for several months, indeed, for the past year, and the Government has failed to act adequately.  It was warned that this would happen if it did not act.  Costs of fuel, one very important input, have been rising.  There are international factors at play, but the Government actually forced higher prices.  When it increased the carbon tax it increased the cost of producing food and the cost of transporting food.  Hey presto, food prices have soared.  Then we hear a Minister of State tell us tonight that the Government will not be found wanting.  It has been found wanting on every single parameter when it comes to the cost-of-living crisis that so many workers and families are experiencing.<\/p>  <p>  We have advocated for years that we must freeze rents and put a month's rent back into people's pockets.  The Government has refused to act.  On mortgages, we had the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, calling for the European Central Bank to intervene, essentially calling for an interest rate hike.  No action has been taken on childcare costs, one of the major costs facing many families, to date.  We have seen token measures on energy.  There was a &euro;200 rebate, which was wiped out before it was even implemented.  On fuel, the Government gives with one hand in terms of minimal excise reductions but then it takes with the other through increases in the carbon tax.  As regards heating costs, it has done nothing whatsoever in respect of home heating oil other than to force the price higher through carbon taxes.  Then there are its harebrained ideas to ban some sources of home heating fuel.<\/p>  <p>  The huge costs people are now enduring for food are again partly the result of this Government's failure to act.  What has been proposed so far to support families with rising food costs?  Nothing yet, and listening to the remarks of the Ministers of State nobody can have confidence that this Government either understands the scale of the crisis people are facing or has any intention of acting appropriately.  All this debate has reaffirmed to me and to anybody watching it is that it is time for a change.  It is time for the policies that Deputies Doherty, Kerrane and the Sinn F&eacute;in team have put forward.<\/p> <p>It is certainly time to get the Government out of office.

In particular, I commend Deputy Kerrane on tabling the motion and on championing this issue on behalf of hundreds of thousands of workers and families who continue to struggle in the face of a cost-of-living crisis.  They see it in the price of food, energy and other essentials, which continues to rise.  They see their bank balances struggle to keep up with the weekly shop and the monthly bill.  Some have been forced to make choices nobody should have to make, including whether to eat or whether to heat, cutting back on food shopping and trying to be sparing in the use of electricity in their homes because the money simply does not go far enough.<\/p>  <p>  Some people benefit from inflation, but for the vast majority there is an income squeeze.  In the D&aacute;il last week, the T&aacute;naiste contended that the entire world faces a cost-of-living crisis, but the reality is that not everyone does.  Lower-income and middle-income families face a far higher bill for their living standards, and a higher fall in living standards, than the wealthiest in society.  Cutting back on food, fuel and other essentials is a crisis; having to cut back on luxury items is not.  The Government simply does not understand the financial strain ordinary workers and families are under right across this State.  If the Government did - if it really got it - it would have responded properly and with greater urgency than it has done.  It has not because it does not get it, and that is the simple fact.  In the past year, inflation has reached more than 8%.  For lower-income to middle-income households, it is some way above 8%.  They now see food prices rise and essentials go up in the supermarkets, and they are feeling it right in the pocket.  The prices of staples such as bread and meat have gone up by more than 5%, while the prices of pasta and milk have increased by 10%.  Some claim that people are living beyond their means; in fact, too many do not have the means to live.  That is the reality, and those people need help from a Government that is tone-deaf to these pleas.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the Government's response has been totally inadequate.  Despite high levels of inflation and inflation figures we have not seen in decades, it has refused to increase working social welfare rates.  That is a disgrace.  Members of the Green Party, which is in government and is allowing those people who depend on these fixed incomes to become poorer in light of inflation at in excess of 8%, should quit their jobs now because it is a disgrace that they have left people struggling in that way.  It is a shocking dereliction of the Government's duty to protect the most vulnerable.  The Government has said its measures are targeted.  The Government should not take my word for this; it should take the word of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, for it.  IFAC states that of &euro;1 billion in measures since the start of this year, &euro;893 million were untargeted.  The Government left those most vulnerable in society without any support whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to energy prices and home heating oil, the Government is making things worse.  It is increasing the costs on families and, despite multiple calls and motions from us on this side of the House and amendments we have tabled, one after the other members of the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael came in here to vote to increase the cost of living on people by pushing up carbon taxes and excise duties on those same families.  The Taoiseach recently doubled down on the Government's refusal to introduce measures to support households until at least October.  Even the Tories and even Boris Johnson understand that their government needed to act in a targeted fashion to protect the most vulnerable.  The fact that Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens still do not get it and still are more out of touch than even Boris Johnson and the Tories screams loudly.<\/p>  <p>  It is not too late to act, however.  That is why we tabled this motion.  The Government said it will not oppose the motion.  That is not what we want from the Government.  We want it to act on the motion.  The motion is very clear.  It screams loudly to the concerns, plights and needs of hundreds of thousands of people across this State.  It recognises that not everybody can be protected from every price increase but that the Government can and must do more.  That is why we call on the Government to introduce cost-of-living cash payments to provide immediate financial support to those on lower and middle incomes.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes cash payments of &euro;200 for every single adult on incomes less than &euro;30,000 and cash payments of &euro;100 for those on incomes between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000.  This would come along with another suite of measures we have proposed such as freezing rents and putting a month's rent back into renters' pockets, increasing core social welfare rates to keep in line with inflation, cutting the cost of childcare and introducing a discretionary energy fund, which is needed.

The scheme is administered locally by the relevant local authority, which is responsible for prioritising and selecting eligible applications within broad parameters set by my Department.

There are many different opportunities to apply for funding from my Department and I want to see a bottom-up approach in order to make a difference for communities, villages and towns.

Local authorities can avail of that money to buy buildings for community use or for the purpose of providing remote working hubs.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanton mentioned Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  We all work together on these issues.  The regional enterprise development fund, which is under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, provides funding in this area.  The T&aacute;naiste is doing a lot of work around remote working and we must continue that work.  We got a chance during the Covid crisis to change work practices.  Continuing that requires new thinking and to look outside the box.  In a survey this week, funded by my Department through the Western Development Commission and conducted by NUI Galway, 30% of respondents said they would change jobs and even take a pay cut if remote working were an option.  People are looking at their options and taking into consideration such factors as quality of life and reduced commuting times.  We want to support them.

As I have said, my objective is to ensure we have an effective, efficient and implementable rural-proofing model that will support rural policy development and will consider and capitalise on the opportunities for rural areas.  It is important to remember that rural-proofing, as the Deputy said, is about making all Government policies more effective by ensuring the specific needs and opportunities in rural areas are taken into consideration as early as possible in the policy development process.  That will ultimately lead to better outcomes for rural communities, which is what we all want, as Deputy Farrell said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100054#DDD01200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","time":1654031400,"counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100054#DDD01300"},{"type":"question","time":1654031400,"counter":377,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[27393\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100054#DDD01400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if she will detail progression of the town centre first policy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1654031400,"counter":378,"content":"<p>My question relates to the progression of the Town Centre First policy, which I know the Minister announced recently.

The Town Centre First policy is a major cross-Government policy that aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into our town centres.  Key to this is the establishment of the national implementation office to assist in the delivery and implementation of the policy, and to co-ordinate stakeholder engagement at a national level.  This office will be responsible for supporting town regeneration officers, TROs, in driving implementation of the policy.  My Department has agreed the structure and funding for the national office and the TROs with local authorities.  The first step is the appointment of the head of the national implementation office.  The recruitment process for this key post is currently ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, local authorities have now also been authorised to commence the recruitment of TROs who will drive the development of town centre first plans at local level across the country.<\/p> <p>Key to the town centre first approach is the range of support funding in place, including the town and village renewal scheme.  This year, I have included under that scheme a new building acquisition measure that will provide up to &euro;400,000 to each local authority to purchase vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages for development as community assets.  This new measure will be a key support for towns in implementing the town centre first approach locally.<\/p> <p> I am committed to ensuring that the continued roll-out of the town centre first policy will work to deliver on the goal of revitalising rural towns and villages as set out in Our Rural Future.  Under the town and village renewal scheme, we still have the other stream of funding whereby up to a maximum of &euro;500,000 can be applied for to acquire a property and carry out refurbishment.  That funding can also be used to repurpose properties that are already in the ownership of local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100054#DDD01600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654032000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I really appreciate the Minister's response.

I will take the opportunity now to read into the record of the House the names of the women who died in the months of May and June since 1996.  In the month of May there were 21 women: Angela Collins, Kitty Gubbins, Georgina O'Donnell, Helen Donegan, Martina Halligan, Donna Cleary, Patti Bainbridge, Mair&eacute;ad Moran, Niamh Murphy, Marie Hennessy, Breda Cummins, Rita Apine, Anastasia Kri&eacute;gel, Mary Ryan, Lorraine Crowley, Georgina Eager, Siobhan Stapleton, Bente Carroll, Patricia Murphy, Patricia O&rsquo;Connor, and Giedre Raguckaite.  In the month of June there were 12 women: Mandy Wong, Sinead Kelly, Gertrude Dolan, Veronica Guerin, Karen Guinee, Sara Neligan, Tracey O'Brien, Jolanta Lubiene, Lynn Cassidy, Antra Ozolina, Skaidrite Valdgeima, and Valerie French Kilroy.  These names are from the Women's Aid Femicide Watch, which was published in March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I shall now outline some of the figures: 249 women have died violently between 1996 and 2022; 18 children have died alongside their mothers; 158 of the women died in their own homes; 196 cases have been resolved; in the 87% of cases that have been resolved, the women were killed by a man known to them; 13% of the women were killed by a stranger; and one in two victims were killed by a current or former male intimate partner, which is 55% of the resolved cases.  It can, of course, be a woman of any age but women under the age of 35 make up 50% of the cases in Ireland.  In almost all murder-suicide cases, which is 22 out of the 23, the killer was the woman's partner.<\/p>  <p>  The reading of the women's names into the record is more important than I had realised.  I was contacted by a woman last week who reminded me about one of the women, whose name I read out previously, who had died in 2004.  They had known each other and the woman rang to tell me the story of how she had pleaded with the woman not go back to that house and how she felt it was only going to end one way.

This commitment has the full support of the Government.  We have been working on a number of fronts to combat DSGBV and to ensure comprehensive supports for victims.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, along with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, commissioned an independent audit of how responsibility for DSGBV is segmented across government.Separately, Tusla conducted a review of accommodation services for victims of DSGBV.  Both of these audits were carried out with a view to determining what efficiencies and improvements need to be introduced in how we manage DSGBV responses and services.<\/p><p>On foot of these audits, and following extensive consultation with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, the Department of Justice will now have responsibility for funding of local refuges, Rape Crisis Centres and associated helplines for victims of DSGBV, while continuing to lead on policy in this area.  As part of this, the establishment of a new statutory agency to address DSGBV is under consideration.  In tandem, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has been working on a whole-of-government strategy on DSGBV.<\/p> <p>This strategy will be the most ambitious to date and will be structured around the four pillars or goals of the Istanbul Convention, namely, prevention, protection, prosecution and co-ordinated policies.  It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in our society for DSGBV.  The strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out.  Earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, briefed those working in the sector on the progress of the strategy and, as part of that ongoing consultation, a wider public consultation run by the Department of Justice concluded in March.  Officials in that Department are currently working to finalise the strategy for submission to Government in light of submissions received in this final consultative phase.<\/p> <p> To deliver on the high ambition of the strategy, it will be accompanied by a detailed action plan for the rest of this year and next.  This action plan will ensure our work is targeted, precise and deliverable.  It will set out how each of the aims will be achieved, which Departments and agencies are responsible for them, and the timeframe for delivery.  The Minister intends to bring both the finalised strategy and the action plan to Government in the coming weeks, well before the summer recess, and they will be published as soon as possible thereafter.  I commend the Minister for her work.

However, it is part of a bigger problem and what leads to it is a cultural acceptance of entry-level harassment and misogyny, which Deputy Alan Farrell called out in a very public way in his experience on public transport.  It is the controlling behaviours that have been exhibited, which Deputy Stanton tried to address through his legislation on coercive control.  People said there was no point, that one could not prosecute a pattern, an idea or a set of behaviours, but that was shown to be wrong.  I commend the Garda for following up and prosecuting what people said could not be prosecuted, that is, that controlling and manipulative set of behaviours.<\/p>  <p>  So much of this issue is rooted in education.  The Joint Committee on Gender Equality is working away every Thursday morning down in the committee rooms.  We have heard from the secondary school students' unions, Safe Ireland and academics.  It does not matter who we speak to; it all comes back to education.  We need fact-based and consent-based education that respects personhood from the earliest age and is open and transparent about sexuality, facts and equality.  Unless every child in Ireland receives this appropriate education, we do not have a chance.  When Deputies in this House drop their kids at school they might look around the playground and wonder which of these children will suffer this fate in 20, 25 or 30 years, or any other form of misogyny or harassment, and which of them will be the perpetrators.  What are we going to do today and over the next five and ten years that is different from the education I got, or the education other Deputies got 20, 30 or 40 years ago?  What are we doing to make it radically different and give us some chance of delivering a better outcome for those children 20 or 25 years from now?  Objective education for all children is the only hope of a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100057#GGG00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1654033200,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely right.  Fear of harassment and violence should never be normalised, be it in the home or as people go about their daily life.  The prioritisation of this hugely important work is evident in the policy and legislative developments implemented by this Government, as well as those currently being progressed.  It is also evidenced by the increased budget allocations that have been secured this year in order to address such heinous and unacceptable behaviour.  That said, we know we need to achieve a lot more.  We need to increase the provision of refuges and have committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a refuge space will have access to one.  As part of its work to finalise the new strategy, the Department of Justice is examining how to advance the recommendations made in the Tusla accommodation review, on both improving the delivery of these spaces and how quickly they are delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct about education.  It is a vital part of this issue.  Education must begin in our schools and preschools, in primary and secondary schools and right throughout our education curriculum, in order to ensure girls and women feel safe in their communities.  That point is very important.  The strategy the Minister is developing will take that whole-of-government approach, including to education.  It is vitally important that it does that.  There is no doubt that we can break this cycle, collectively, and that is something we are committed to doing.  There is a huge responsibility on the education system to try to deliver that.

We raised it some time ago and were given assurances that work was ongoing on the matter.  I then submitted a parliamentary question on it.  To say the reply was opaque and less than satisfactory would be putting it mildly.  We are talking about a Bill that had passed the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, where some amendments were made, and fell because an election was called in the beginning of 2020.  This is basically an Aladdin's lamp Bill.  The issue was that the bogs that were degraded and had been cut were being swapped for pristine bogs that would be designated as natural heritage areas, NHAs.  Unlike Aladdin's lamp, this really was new for old and there was no genie one had to rub to find the old one was better.<\/p>  <p>  It is hard to understand how it has taken the Department three years to come to this point - or not come to it, which is the issue - and we still have not had sight of a recommitted Bill.  Either the amendments from the Seanad were satisfactory or they were not.  One would think that if they were not satisfactory, the Government would have gone back to the original Bill passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and recommitted that to the D&aacute;il or introduced a new Bill, the wildlife (amendment) Bill 2022.  We need a certain date by which this Bill will be introduced into the D&aacute;il so it can get swift passage through and become law, as was promised before the previous Government was formed back in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100057#GGG00500","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1654033200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I concur with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said.  We brought this issue up in the D&aacute;il previously.  We had a meeting with Department officials on it and I thank the Minister of State for that.  On that day, we were told the Bill was basically going to be brought back or rewritten.  There were obstacles but the officials said they had found ways around them and we were going to have it.  That was my understanding.  It was going to be gone through before the summer recess.  I have looked at schedules and maybe I have missed something but I cannot see it there.  The Government does not realise the torture this is causing.  There are people who want to plant land and cannot because this Bill is held up.  There are people who want to build a house and cannot because the very minute a council looks at the application, the area is put down as an NHA and the council walks away.  That is what they do.  When the forestry service gets something that is in a designated area, it is bye-bye.  That is the seriousness of it.  With the planting situation at the moment, we have hit 50%.  When you have people willing to do things, you need to work with them.  I have been involved in all of this down through the years.

It should never have been put in but it was put in and, in fairness, the National Parks and Wildlife Service was going to rectify that.

I thought we would have advanced the Bill but it has been complex.  The principal purpose of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, as initiated, was to provide for the review of raised bog habitats, the making, amendment and revocation of natural heritage area orders and, for those purposes, the amendment of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the Bill was originally presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  There was a very constructive debate on the Bill in both Houses, including in respect of extending its scope to provide for a review of blanket bog natural heritage areas, and later in the Seanad in respect of placing a duty on public bodies to promote the conservation of biodiversity.  The Bill had completed all Stages in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and had been returned to the D&aacute;il for consideration of the various amendments made by the Seanad, for what is colloquially known as the cream list stage, when the Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il on 14 January 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Standing Order 227 provides that where a Bill passed by the D&aacute;il is subsequently amended and passed by the Seanad, those amendments are then returned to the D&aacute;il for its consideration.  Standing Order 228 provides that the D&aacute;il may accept, amend or reject the Seanad amendments.  Amendments in the D&aacute;il to the Seanad's amendments may be moved only where they are \"consequential upon the acceptance, amendment or rejection of a Seanad amendment\".  There is no mechanism under Standing Orders to move amendments to a Bill returned to the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 227, other than as set out in Standing Order 228.<\/p>  <p>  As discussed when I met the Deputies in December last, the restoration of the Bill to the Order Paper is not straightforward.  Once the complexities have been resolved, however, and the amendments made in the Seanad re-examined in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, to ensure they have been worded correctly and are legally robust, it is the intention of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to bring a memorandum to the Government to seek approval to have the Bill restored to the Order Paper.  At the same time, the Minister will also bring a memorandum to the Government to obtain approval to the amendments made in the Seanad to the Bill.  This process is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed shortly, although I cannot give an accurate date for that.  I met officials this morning about the issue to try to get it advanced as quickly as possible.

I find it awfully strange that the OPC could not give the Government a new wording for any amendments, the substance of which it accepted but not the wording.

We have never seen it so bad.  There is a complete absence of available emergency accommodation for those who desperately need it.  Homelessness service providers have spoken to me, as they do regularly, and have advised me there are simply not enough available beds in the city.  In fact, they understand there are none available at the moment.  People who were once able to afford their rent can do so no longer and there seems to have been a significant increase in the number of notices to quit being issued across the board, given all my D&aacute;il and council colleagues tell me the same.  The recent issuing of such notices <i>en masse<\/i>to the residents of the Shannon Arms apartment complex is evidence of this, and with the severe lack of affordable rental units available in and around the city, it is no surprise there has been an increase in the demand for homelessness services.<\/p><p>My office, as I am sure is the case with those of all Limerick Deputies, has been inundated with calls from those at risk of losing their residence.  Many are working families, often in great distress, who feel utterly abandoned by the State in their hour of need.  Many simply do not earn enough to be able to afford a mortgage, but neither do they meet the income thresholds to avail of social housing supports.  Even if they did, the Limerick housing list extends to 2,214 people and they have no hope of being housed, with thousands more people in precarious housing assistance payment, HAP, properties who live in fear of getting a notice to quit.  Emergency accommodation in Limerick often includes a variety of properties such as hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, hostels and temporary accommodation, and there is now a deep concern some families will be unable to access any of these forms of accommodation.<\/p><p>Where are these people supposed to go?  For too long when it comes to housing, governments have relied on the housing assistance payment, but HAP is at the discretion of the landlord and in many cases landlords will not accept tenants who want to avail of that payment.  Even if they do, the payment itself is modest.  HAP's usefulness has passed and without review it can no longer be fit for purpose.  What we need is an increase in the number of available social and truly affordable houses.  Today in my office, we were dealing with a family in which both parents are working.  They are due to be evicted and have simply nowhere to go.  There are no affordable units to rent and they earn too much to avail of State support.  The limits that would allow them to get some State support have not changed since 2011.  Their notice is nearly up and there is nothing we can do for them.<\/p> <p>This family of seven will be homeless and on the streets.  We cannot direct them to a temporary emergency accommodation solution as the units are all full.  We have a cost-of-living crisis, rising unaffordable rents and landlords selling up and exiting the market.  These factors combined are pushing people to their limits.  We need an immediate ban on evictions to be introduced while we work through this cost-of-living crisis.  I appeal to the Minister of State to personally intervene to ensure emergency spaces are opened and hard-working families are not put on the streets.  A ban on evictions is needed immediately but an increase in the social income thresholds is also desperately needed.  As it stands, the cut-off point is too low and excludes many of those who need such support.<\/p> <p> We are facing a tsunami of evictions in Limerick and it must be stopped.  As I said to the Minister of State, I have never seen anything like the current number of notices to quit and nor have any of the services in Limerick.  I want to put that on record.  The Minister of State should not say he has not been warned about what is happening.  The rental crisis is one the Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage desperately need to resolve.  Failure to do so will leave many families without a home.  This is a crisis to add to the twin problems of homelessness and overcrowding.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes much more can be done.  It is time the Government stepped up to ensure increased investment in delivery of affordable and cost-rental houses.<\/p> <p> Despite the challenges we are facing in Limerick, I commend the work of the providers of emergency accommodation in the city, including the council's homeless action team, Novas, Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and others that do great work.  However, tonight, tomorrow and the day after they face the unenviable task of telling people they have nowhere to put them.  They are under huge pressure and do tremendous work but are now limited in what they can do.  Just before I finish, I mention in particular a voluntary, community-based organisation in Limerick called Help the Homeless where Jackie Purcell Duhig, Annemarie Sheehan and other volunteers do sterling work.  The organisation is really the final front line.  It feeds and clothes people in often appalling weather, like we have today.<\/p> <p> We need action on notices to quit and an immediate ban on evictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100058#HHH01600","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654034400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  I was in Limerick last Friday meeting officials in relation to my portfolio but I also dropped into Limerick Men's Shed and I commend all fantastic work being done there.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to address some of the questions the Deputy has raised.  Supporting individuals and families facing homelessness is a key Government priority.  The role of my Department is to ensure that a framework of policy, legislation and funding are provided to ensure housing authorities are in a position to address homelessness at a local level.  I assure the Deputy that resources and funding are not an obstacle to the urgent efforts required.  Budget 2022 reflects this commitment by allocating &euro;194 million for homelessness services.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are currently severe pressures on access to emergency accommodation in Limerick city for a variety of reasons.  I understand that Limerick City and County Council is doing everything in its power to address this matter.  Under Housing for All, the Government has committed to working to eradicate homelessness by 2030.  The plan includes 18 distinct actions tailored to eliminate homelessness.  These actions recognise individuals experiencing homelessness have additional support needs and include specific measures to address these needs.  They include measures to engage with and support rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of Housing First, a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bedroom homes and, importantly, ensuring provision of the necessary health and mental health supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling homelessness requires an inter-agency approach.  In order to drive better co-ordination in respect of policy measures and actions, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has established the national homeless action committee, NHAC.  All of the key Government Departments, agencies, NGOs and stakeholders are involved.  One of the initial priorities of the NHAC is to examine additional measures to prevent individuals and families from entering into homelessness before they receive the notice to quit the Deputy spoke about.<\/p>  <p>  The key to addressing homelessness is an increase in the supply of housing.  That being the case, the Government has committed to the increased supply of public, social and affordable homes.  We will increase the social housing stock by more than 50,000 with an emphasis on new builds.  In budget 2022, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;4 billion for the delivery of housing.  In this regard, Limerick City and County Council has a target of over 2,600 units to be delivered under Housing for All.  There are already 1,000 units in its pipeline and the council is currently working to add additional projects and units under a variety of delivery streams.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Quinlivan and others in the House of the work being done.  Addressing homelessness continues to be an absolute priority for this Government.  The points raised about the HAP are valid.  The overall thrust of Government policy is to try to reduce reliance on that payment.  While the ESRI report outlines that these rental income supports are an important part of the infrastructure, the Minister is committed to ensuring we reduce that reliance.  The only way we will do that is by delivering social housing stock.  We are committed to doing that and it is important we do so.  I will raise with the Minister the issues of emergency spaces and the social income thresholds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100059#JJJ00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1654034400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

St. Mary's Parish Men's Shed is a good facility.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that with the answer he has just given, the Minister of State is being sincere.  However, none of what he said bears fruit in the real world.  Families are desperate.  Rental prices are too high and too few, if any, properties are available.  This has put immense stress on people.  As I said, the homeless services are under severe pressure.  They do a fantastic job but they cannot house people when there is no accommodation available.  I want to know what we are going to do.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's failure to provide a sufficient level of new social housing, coupled with the shrinking private market, is driving homeless presentations.  The figures speak for themselves.  The number of homeless adults and children has risen to over 10,000 according to the Department's own figures.  On the Minister's watch, there has been a 24% increase in homelessness compared with the same month last year.  As with house prices, there is increase after increase.  The figures for adult homelessness tell us there are 283 adults homeless in Limerick.  Obviously, there are many more people who have nowhere to stay and there are more on the streets than we have ever seen.  Many are couch-surfing or just living in very poor conditions, often in extremely overcrowded homes.  Many such people are not on any of these lists.  The mid-west has 109 homeless children, the bulk of whom are in Limerick city.  What is striking and also very disappointing about these figures is the number of young adults in homeless accommodation.  People who should be in the most exciting period of their lives are battling with having to settle for homeless accommodation.  There has been a 70% increase year on year in these figures.<\/p>  <p>  There is something seriously wrong, and if the Minister of State thinks the Government's housing plan is working, he is delusional.

Local authorities use commercial hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation but as the tourism market opens up, that accommodation is becoming restricted as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Department sets the overall policy and legislative framework that provides the necessary resources and decisions on the range of homeless accommodation required.  The funding of such services is a matter for the individual authorities.  The administration of homelessness services is organised on a regional basis with a lead authority in place for each region.  Limerick City and County Council is the lead authority for the mid-west region, which includes Clare Country Council.  Some &euro;8.2 million in Exchequer funding was provided to the mid-west region in 2021, with over &euro;3.8 million in funding recouped to date in 2022 and further payments to be made.  I again assure the Deputy that resources are not the problem.<\/p>  <p>  We have a significant challenge, as I said, across a number of sectors.  This will be addressed primarily in the medium to long term by the coming on stream of social and affordable housing.  The Government is doing all in its power under Housing for All and Housing First to work with local authorities, including Limerick City and County Council, to ensure they are able to meet their requirements.  There is no doubt it is a significant challenge.<\/p>  <p>  I will take the specific points the Deputy has raised back to the Minister and we can expand on them in a further response, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100059#JJJ00400","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","time":1654034400,"counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100059#JJJ00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1654034400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here at this late hour.  This is an important issue.  I have come across a number of people who have applied to their respective local authorities for loans.  The process seems to be cumbersome and drawn-out.  To give an example, I we contacted by a couple who applied for a loan over six months ago.  They were advised by the local authority that they had to get a mortgage protection policy with a particular insurance company and they proceeded to do so.<\/p> <p>They filled out all the documentation over five months ago.  They contacted the insurance company consistently throughout January and February and were advised that the company could not give them the information about whether they had been approved for mortgage protection.  Eventually the local authority wrote to them on 8 March advising them that they had been turned down for mortgage protection.  Therefore, they were back to square one and had to go and organise mortgage protection.  However, it turns out that the mortgage protection company had notified the local authority on 21 January and the local authority did not notify the loan applicants until 8 March, a gap of six weeks.  The problem now is that by the time it eventually came for approval to the local authority the house had gone back up on the market and the price has gone up by &euro;20,000.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> It reminds me of a time when I dealt with nothing but house purchases and when people were on 18% bridging finance.  The entire process was drawn out.  People were on bridging finance for up to six months.  They could not draw down the loan until they were registered as owners of the property, the mortgage was signed and a mortgage was registered in favour of the local authority in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  We are going back to the same system as we had in the 1980s, where processes are far too slow and hurdles appear to be constantly put in place.  It is time there was an audit of every local authority regarding how many applications they are processing, the timeframe from the time the application is made to the time it is approved and then with regard to the draw down of funds.  Again, I have received a complaint about the delay in the draw down of funds.  Vendors are getting frustrated and they are using conditions in contracts to get out of contracts because they know they can get a higher price for the property they are selling.  The price of property is going up by the day.  It is a major problem.  It is an issue we must deal with immediately.  There must be a fast, efficient system.<\/p> <p> The other issue is why local authorities are advising people that they must have a particular mortgage protection policy.  It is normally left to the person's own devices to get mortgage protection.  Yes, it must have certain rules and must be in accordance with what the local authority has in place, but why is it specifying that the person must go through its company first and if the company turns the person down, he or she can start to seek mortgage protection from another company?  Finally, the mortgage protection company has been engaged by the local authority.  That company advised this person that the company could not correspond with the person to tell the person whether cover was being provided.  That is wrong.  These are the people who will be paying the premium and they are the people who should be told first whether they have the policy.<\/p> <p> These are the issues that are arising.  I am hearing this constantly from legal colleagues as well.  It is a long, drawn-out process.  It was fine when the market was stable and prices were not increasing dramatically.  It is a different ball game now, and we have to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100059#JJJ00600","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654035000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>The local authority home loan is a Government-backed mortgage for first-time buyers and other eligible applicants delivered through local authorities.  The scheme provides mortgage financing for those who are unable to secure a sufficient commercial bank loan.  It was introduced on 4 January 2022, replacing the previous Rebuilding Ireland home loan.<\/p><p>It is worth setting out at a high level how the approval process operates.  While my Department has no direct role in processing individual applications, it provides guidance and supports to local authorities to assist them in scheme delivery.  A credit policy has been issued, as well as supporting guidelines.  The receipt and processing of the local authority home loan is a matter for individual local authorities.  The length of time required to process a loan varies depending on the specific details of each application and the quality and completeness of the information received.  Only when all the required information has been provided can the application be considered as validated and sent to the Housing Agency for review by its specialist team of underwriters who issue recommendations to the local authorities to approve or refuse applications, on average within five calendar days.  The local authority credit committee decides whether a loan application should be approved.  In most local authorities, the credit committee meets monthly, depending on the number of applications on hand.  The credit committee's decision is then communicated to the applicant.<\/p><p>From this point onwards, the house purchase process reverts to the approved applicant.  The length of this process is largely dependent on the applicant finding a house and the conveyancing process, and can vary depending on each transaction.  Since many elements of the mortgage process are not under the control of the local authorities it would not be realistic to set deadlines for processing times.  I note that one element of the process that is internal to the public sector is the underwriting decision on validated applications.  That is completed on average in five days, which I consider to be timely.<\/p><p>My Department is in regular contact with local authorities regarding the local authority home loan and stands by to offer any assistance or guidance that is required to support the timely processing of these loans.  At this stage I do not see a need for a policy change or audit regarding processing.  However, my Department keeps the operation of the local authority home loan under review and will respond if further information comes to light, as the Deputy has brought forward tonight.  I do not have county breakdowns but under the previous Rebuilding Ireland home loan 2,700 home loans were drawn down from 2018 to 2021.  The data on draw downs is not yet available for the local authority home loan, which commenced on 4 January this year.  The underwriters for the home loan have reported that 26 Rebuilding Ireland home loan applications and 213 local authority home loan applications were processed by the Housing Agency in April 2022.  Of the 213 applications, ten were invalid, 82 were recommended for approval, which is 43%, and 121 were recommended for decline.<\/p><p>The Deputy also asked a question about the mortgage protection policy, which is left to the homeowner.  I will make an inquiry within the Department about that for him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100060#KKK00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1654035000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I am concerned about this.  It reminds me of the 1980s when there was a long, drawn-out process for getting loans.  We are back to square one.  We are in a world where the market is moving very fast and we must respond accordingly.  It is like with the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme where landlords have started saying that if somebody is drawing the HAP, they would not take the person on as a tenant.  This will happen now with vendors.  They will say they will not take people on as purchasers if they are going to get a local authority loan.  That will happen and there will be a large number of people excluded from the market.<\/p>  <p>  We must deal with the real world.  A credit committee meeting once a month is totally inadequate.  That is an issue we must prioritise.  We must examine it now and see what can be done to expedite the process.  If there is a step-by-step process set out for the applicants and each of the boxes are ticked before the local authority gets the application, including all the documentation, it should not take six months for the application to be processed.  This is happening with some of the other financial institutions as well; it is not just the local authorities.  It is causing massive problems for young people who have only one opportunity of getting on the housing ladder.  What if they miss it?<\/p>  <p>  The couple I am dealing with, and I have dealt with a number of others who have the same problem, are unlikely to come back onto the market again.  This is the sad problem we have.  That is why this issue must be prioritised before we have the same thing as happened with the HAP scheme whereby the vendors will say that if it is a local authority loan they will not get their solicitors to send out contracts to people.
