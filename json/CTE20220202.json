I am joined by the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement and eGovernment, Deputy Ossian Smyth.  The group comprises a significant number of Votes including: Vote 11 - Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12, Superannuation and Retired Allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions; the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department, including the Vote 14 - State Laboratory, Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service, Vote 18 - National Shared Services Office, and Vote 19 - the Office of the Ombudsman; Vote 15 - the Secret Service; Vote 39 - the Office of Government Procurement; and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer  The Minister of State is happy to address questions relating to the Office of Government Procurement and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, and I will respond to members' questions regarding the other Votes.<\/p> <p>  I understand that a detailed briefing has been supplied to the committee by my officials, who were assisted in this task by their colleagues in a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department.  Further material is also contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2022, which was prepared by my Department.  I also wish to take the opportunity to acknowledge last week's letter from the Chairman in respect of the joint committee&rsquo;s recent Report on the Processes and Procedures Applying to the Appointment of Senior Executives in the Public Service.  I will of course answer any questions members of the committee may wish to put to me on that issue.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has presented unprecedented challenges for us all.  I welcome the recent unwinding of Covid-19 measures and the opportunity to return to what is euphemistically referred to as normal life.  I would add that while this has been a long and difficult journey, I hope that we can now focus our entire efforts on improving the quality of life and living for our people.<\/p> <p>  In an overall context, the 2022 total gross allocation for the public expenditure and reform group of Votes, which comprises nine distinct Votes, has increased by 5% on the 2021 allocation.  The gross figure for 2022 is in excess of &euro;940 million compared to &euro;895 million in 2021.  This is largely driven by a significant increase in the estimate provision for Vote 18 and Vote 43, additional EU funding, targeted and minor increases for the delivery of essential services and additional recruitment, and the meeting of additional salary costs.  At this point, I will briefly outline the individual Votes in a little more detail.<\/p> <p>  Vote 11 relates to my Department, which continues to have a wide range of objectives across two strategic programmes, public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform, which support the two strategic goals of the Department.  These are: to manage public expenditure at sustainable levels in a planned, balanced and evidence-informed manner in support of Ireland&rsquo;s economic, social and climate goals; and to drive reform and innovation across the civil and public service to improve service delivery to the public and to enhance strategic policymaking and public governance structures.<\/p> <p>  The principal element of the 10% and &euro;4.6 million increased 2022 provision is in respect of technical assistance across the subheads that manage EU funding.  Most of the &euro;3.3 million increase in the EU subheads will be refunded directly to the Exchequer by the European Union into appropriations-in-aid.  The most significant changes to the subhead budgets are: the special EU programmes body funding has more than doubled to &euro;4.9 million following an increase in EU funding for the new programme cycle; &euro;1.7 million for technical assistance and the provision of additional auditors to ensure sufficient auditing resources to match the increase in EU programme funding; and &euro;1.4 million to cover the cost of a small number of extra posts, pay increases and an expectation of a reduction of vacancies at the Department.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the other Votes in the group, the provision for Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances, accounts for three quarters of the public expenditure and reform group of Votes allocation and an overall 1% increase over the 2021 provision.  The estimate I am proposing today for Vote 12 involves a gross provision of &euro;707.6 million and primarily provides for pension and retirement lump sums for civil servants, including prison officers, and pension payments for dependents.  I note that this Vote required supplementary funding in 2021 of &euro;34 million, which was offset from appropriations-in-aid and gave rise to a technical supplementary estimate of &euro;1,000.  This was sought as a result of a higher number of retirements than expected and was approved by the D&aacute;il last year.  Year-to-year variation in expenditure on this Vote is primarily driven by the number of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age and whose years of service, and grade and pay level, are variable and uncertain.  The increase in gross expenditure is mitigated by an increase in contributions from the single public service pension scheme.<\/p> <p>  Other bodies under the aegis of the Department, such as the Public Appointments Service, the National Shared Services Office and the State Laboratory, provide important services to large numbers of clients across the civil and public service.  The State Laboratory, Vote 14, is the Government&rsquo;s principal analytical chemistry laboratory and provides a comprehensive analytical and advisory service to Departments and Government offices.  A 3% increase to the State Laboratory&rsquo;s 2021 Estimate allows the laboratory to continue delivery on their mandate, meet increased pay and recruit additional staff.<\/p><p>The proposed funding provision for the Public Appointments Service - Vote 17 - is reduced by 4% in 2022.  This reflects the 57% reduction in capital cost requirements in 2022 given the anticipated mid-year conclusion of the refurbishment of the service's Chapter House office, and a 50% increase in payroll costs with an associated increase on current staffing levels.<br\/><br\/>Vote 18, the National Shared Services Office, NSSO, is the shared services provider for the Civil Service.  The office has played an important role in the reform of public services in recent years, through the delivery of human resources, HR, shared services and payroll shared services to clients across the Civil Service and public service.  The National Shared Services Office continues to be in growth and investment mode and will commence its delivery of new services for the whole of government this year.  This significant growth is reflected in the additional provision of &euro;11.9 million and a total provision of &euro;73.45 million in 2022, a 19% annual increase in funding.  The proposed increased provision in the NSSO's 2022 allocation will facilitate the continued delivery of HR and payroll shared services and enable the office to progress the roll-out of financial management shared services, which is scheduled to go online in the coming months.<br\/><br\/>The Estimate provision for the Office of the Ombudsman - Vote 19 - and the proposed modest 1% increase will enable its various constituent offices to manage their respective operations; fund the additional costs arising from the pay restoration and increased salary costs; facilitate a continued investment in ICT modernisation; and fund the establishment of the proposed new protected disclosures office.  I also welcome the appointment of Mr. Ger Deering to the position of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner and I have no doubt he will build upon the excellent contribution of the previous incumbent, Mr. Peter Tyndall.  I wish them both every future success.<br\/><br\/>The State procures goods and services valued in the region of &euro;8.5 billion annually.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP - Vote 39 - leads our procurement reform programme by providing advice, guidance and systems to promote better public procurement and build capacity and capability across the public service.  The proposed 2022 allocation of &euro;19.8 million provides for the cost of staffing as well as the costs associated with recruitment of senior positions, as recommended in the organisation review.  The 2022 provision will <i>inter alia<\/i>support the OGP in delivering value for money, quality goods and services in compliance with national and European law; develop procurement arrangements for the delivery of improved procurement capability in the public service, which will yield financial, performance and risk management benefits to the State; and further develop the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland, including the promotion of social and green environmental considerations.<br\/><br\/>The State cannot fall behind the productivity gains that 21st century technology is bringing to industry.  The Civil Service renewal strategy, Digital First, challenges the Civil Service to deliver 90% of applicable services that are consumed online via accessible, integrated and customer-driven solutions.  The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO - Vote 43 - drives the digital transformation agenda across government while providing and developing pan-public service ICT infrastructure, service delivery models and cross-government applications.  The widespread adoption of the full range of build to share services, delivered by a single organisation, will address, in large part, the relatively slow pace of digital transformation in government by freeing up Departments and bodies to focus on transformation initiatives rather than simply keeping the lights on.  The OGCIO benefits this year from a very significant 90% increase in its &euro;43.3 million Vote.  This funding is bolstered by a &euro;23 million EU allocation over two years in respect of the recovery and resilience programme, with some &euro;18.5 million invested in 2022.  It will deliver a network that enables all of our State bodies to reap the benefit of 5G technology.<br\/><br\/>I draw the Deputies' attention to some changes in the presentation of administrative subheads in 2022, which arise on foot of the new financial management service system being introduced in some Votes.  This change will bring consistency of approach and allow for better comparisons between Votes.  An implication of this is that in 2022 there is some discontinuity between 2021 and 2022 figures.  I am happy to provide further briefing on any points of detail Deputies may wish to raise in this regard.<br\/><br\/>I am very pleased to present the 2022 Estimates for the Public Expenditure and Reform group, approval of which will allow the individual Votes to continue to operate and meet their responsibilities to deliver essential services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and I are both happy to respond to any questions that members may put.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#A01200","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire agus leis an Aire St&aacute;it as teacht os comhair an choiste.

Having considered the matter carefully, it is my intention, as Minister, to propose the establishment of an independent external review panel tasked with a number of key objectives.  One objective will be to make recommendations to strengthen the recruitment process for senior public service posts, including at the top of the Civil Service and a number of key public service posts, and also to make recommendations on the process of determining the terms and conditions of employment associated with such posts  I am happy to go into that in more detail and to take the Deputy's questions.<\/p> <p>  On the specific question raised by Deputy Farrell, the issue of gifting a portion of salary is very much a matter for individuals.

Under the Taxes Consolidation Act, section 483 deals with the issue of gifting of salary on an annual basis.

In other words, the use of the proceeds is a matter for government.

I must say that the issue of the &euro;81,000 increase has caused absolute public outcry and outrage.  As I have said to the Minister before, the decision to grant that increase was completely out of touch.  People are struggling at the moment.  It was of interest that over the past two weeks, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, raised concerns about wage spiralling when the impact of inflation on the rise of the cost of living was put to them.  It seems those concerns will impact decisions on whether lower paid workers will see increases in their wages.  I recall that the Minister felt that the increase for the Secretary General position was necessary in order to ensure international competition for the job. I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, said last week that he was concerned that increasing wages would impact our competitiveness.  It is ironic.  It seems to me that the Government is only concerned about wage increases impacting competitiveness and wage spiralling when it comes to low-paid workers rather than those at the higher end - the elites who already have vast sums of money coming into their pockets each month.  It is different for the ordinary person who is struggling to put food on the table and keep the lights on.

As the Deputy knows, there then followed an open competitive process which was administered by the Top-Level Appointments Committee and the Public Appointments Service.  There were a significant number of applicants, including a number of international candidates who put themselves forward.  I acknowledge that the joint committee, along with a number of members of the Committee of Public Accounts, conducted a significant amount of work over the course of last year and furnished a report in November making a series of recommendations for consideration.  I have given some consideration to those at this point.  We have a public service pay deal, Building Momentum, in place.  It involves, in essence, three 1% increases over a two-year period.  That pay deal will end at the end of the current year.  As the Deputy knows, for both the increases in October 2021 and October 2022, we built in a proviso that there would be a minimum increase for those who are at the lower end of the pay scales across the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#C00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>We are aware of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#C00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>For example, somebody earning &euro;20,000, instead of getting a flat 1% increase, which would amount to &euro;200, will get two and a half times that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#C00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>We also see that one staff member is going to be earning &euro;298,000.

I am fully aware of the public service stability agreement and the situation around it.  The point here is that we have a situation where somebody is earning &euro;298,000.  I would be interested to hear if the Minister is concerned there will be further pay claims from other senior and top civil servants.  One Minister has said that the &euro;81,000 increase was fundamental and was needed to recruit somebody.  Nobody is suggesting the process was not correct.  We are talking about the &euro;81,000.  We are not suggesting that the person who is in place should not be in place.  The point is that we are seeing an &euro;81,000 increase for one particular role.

Whether we like the position or not, it is the case that the gifting of a portion of a person's salary, which I am happy to do because I think it is the right thing to do, is a matter for each individual.  Our public servants and civil servants are entitled to gift a portion of their salary.  The question of when exactly it was put in place and when it ended is not information I have or to which I would be entitled.  In the first instance, an employee of a Department completes the form, which then goes through the process within that Department and is ultimately conveyed to the Department of Finance.  I do not have that information, nor do I intend to seek it from any individual because it is none of my business, quite frankly.  My role is to ensure we have a robust system for the recruitment and selection of people to fill key posts in the Civil Service and at senior levels across the public service.  I am determined to do that.  I am going to set up an independent review panel.  I anticipate it will be completely removed from my Department.  It will advise on the pay determination process.  I note the recommendation that the Deputy and her colleagues made about reinstituting the higher remuneration review body.  That is not a step I am taking now but I am going to ask the independent panel to make recommendations on what it thinks is the best course of action to arrive at decisions relating to senior pay in the Civil Service and across the public service.<\/p> <p>  I think we need to be careful what we wish for, as I said to the Deputy in November when I had an initial exchange with the committee.  The higher remuneration review body was stood down in 2009.  In 2007, as the Deputy knows, that body made recommendations that Secretaries General would receive pay as high as &euro;318,000, the Taoiseach would be paid &euro;330,000 and Ministers would be paid &euro;280,000.  If we, as an Oireachtas, absolve ourselves of responsibility and if I, as Minister, absolve myself of responsibility and completely hand over control of this matter to a third party body, we may not like the outcome.  That is something we must also consider.  I am not committing today to the establishment of the higher remuneration review body, which is what the Deputy has sought.  We need to think this through very carefully.  The external panel I am setting up will advise me in the coming months as to what it thinks is the best course of action.  I will take that advice on board and make a decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#C00700","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I will move on to Vote 11.

It is the setting up of an independent panel outside the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

It will look at the composition of TLAC.  I am aware the committee made a recommendation that there be a majority of people from a public service background on TLAC.  I take a different view.  Currently, TLAC has a majority of people from outside the civil and public service, which is a better overall balance, especially when we are trying to attract more people from the private sector into the civil and public service.  There is also the issue of pay determination.  As I said, I am not accepting at this point the committee's recommendation to set up a higher remuneration review body because having looked over the history of this matter, there are issues that would need to be carefully thought through.  I will ask the independent panel to come back to me with a view on that.

I have done so numerous times but do so again as Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell has raised it.<\/p><p>The decision to increase the salary of a particular individual or position by &euro;81,000 was a disgraceful decision taken quietly in some back room in Government Buildings.  There was the addition of &euro;3,000 and then the increase yesterday bringing it to &euro;298,000.  I disagree with the Minister in respect of the gifting.  He stated it is a personal matter.  Actually, this particular position is so outside the norm in terms of salary that it should be ring-fenced and treated separately.  If a person got an increase of &euro;81,000 in 2021-22, I cannot see the logic of him getting two further increases in 2022.  Surely because the person got an increase of &euro;81,000, any other increases that were agreed for those at that level within the Civil Service who are paid less should be withheld from that position because of the special arrangements that were made.  As I stated, there was no memo of the Cabinet.  I do not know from where it originated because, in spite of the 288-page report, the Minister was probably the most forthcoming of all Ministers in terms of the explanation.  The Taoiseach, however, was not.  Mr. Watt was not.  He sent us a copy of the press release.  His behaviour since then has been utterly disgraceful.<\/p><p> I question the level of payment he is now receiving.  I believe it should be ring-fenced and the two increases we are discussing should not be added on to that increase of &euro;81,000.  The Minister stated the gifting is a personal matter.  I believe it is but, in this case, the gifting was done publicly by press release.  We do not know when it started or when it ended.  It seems to have been down to one person to make this decision while blatantly ignoring the Committee of Public Accounts and the finance committee, thereby giving licence to anybody else to just not turn up to a committee and not be held to account by us.  The manner in which the increase and the appointment happened leaves a lot to be desired.  It did a disservice to civil servants and the public service.<\/p><p> The Minister said there would be no knock-on effects.  I am not saying this is a knock-on effect, but I want to compare it.  I refer to report No. 42 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public service, on which the Minister gave us a comprehensive response, in respect of senior managers within the HSE, many of them retired.  They now are being put through another process to get what they have already been approved for by the Labour Court, yet for one man in one position it is a completely different matter.  The public are absolutely outraged, and rightly so.  These special arrangements have to stop.  If this was a special arrangement - obviously, it was - there should be no further increases.  The Minister should be suggesting to the individual who holds this position that it is special and separate, over and above what is there already, and, therefore, the increase should be treated differently.  That is what I am suggesting.  There has to be fair play here.  I said the public are angry.  Members of the D&aacute;il were furious about the way this happened - not just the appointment and the increase, but the total disregard for parliamentary procedure by elected representatives and senior officials.  I believe I have to make those comments because I have said things publicly and I wish to place it again on record as Deputy Farrell has raised the matter, and rightly so.  I have made my views known.  If the Minister wishes to comment, that is fair enough.  If not, we can move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#D01800","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I will, of course, comment.  As always, I greatly appreciate the honesty and frankness of the Chairman.  He has made his views known on the issue quite consistently in recent times.  However, as a Minister answering questions such as those being put to me, I have to set out the legal position and I cannot go beyond that.  The truth is that when it comes to the gifting of a salary, it is anchored in taxation legislation.  Every person is an individual taxpayer and has a right to privacy, so it is not for me to declare, even if I had the information, which I do not, when any individual started gifting or stopped gifting.  I simply do not have that information and I am not actually entitled to it.  I have to present the facts whether we like them or not.  I do not always like the facts either but I cannot change them nonetheless.<\/p> <p>  The Building Momentum agreement involves three single 1% increases.  The most recent increase on 1 February was structured around a sectoral bargaining process.  There are several sectoral bargaining units that are still involved in a negotiation and may well not use that allocation of funding for a flat 1% increase.  They may use it to resolve what they regard as outstanding issues.  I expect several of those will come to a conclusion in the coming weeks and some of them will result in the resolution of issues that have been knocking around for quite a long time.  That will be welcome.  As regards the Civil Service, the sectoral bargaining units that were established have opted for the flat 1% increase under Building Momentum.<\/p> <p>  To correct the record because I do not wish to give the wrong impression, I think I misquoted at least one figure in the context of some of the recommendations made by the higher remuneration review body in the past.  It recommended salaries of up to &euro;318,000 for Secretaries General, &euro;310,000 for the Taoiseach, &euro;270,000 for the T&aacute;naiste, &euro;240,000 for Ministers and up to &euro;270,000 for the heads of various colleges and universities.  These recommendations were made back in 2007.  I make those points by way of context.  We have to think very carefully about the next steps.  I am clear what the next step should be from my perspective and that is to have this independent panel, removed from the Department, have a fresh look at this area and make recommendations to me.  I will be happy to engage with the committee again on the matter.

The Minister sits at the top of the Department in the sense of setting policy.

The question of dismissing a Secretary General is one for the Government as a collective.

It is essential that we have rapid procurement but that we also manage to get good value for money, that we obtain goods that are high quality and that we do so in a transparent way.  We have to comply with European procurement law, first.  Public procurement is all about fairness and giving everybody equal opportunity to compete.  That means we do need to advertise and keep the competition open for a certain period.  However, it should be done as quickly as possible within those constraints.  That particularly applies now because we are in a period of inflation.  If a procurement drags on for too long the price will have gone up and the requirements of the project may change over time.  The last two years has been a really unusual period in procurement because of the pandemic.  The normal rules of procurement were effectively suspended over the last two years.  In a period where we had to obtain PPE in a hurry, for example, or anything related to the pandemic such as software to manage the vaccination roll out, while we tried to run competitive tenders they did not have to fit with the normal rules of procurement.  We used whatever exemption clauses were available in an emergency.  The procurement rules allow that when you have a general threat to public health, and when there is some kind of life and death emergency, you can speed up the rules.  I meet every quarter with representatives of small businesses to ask them how they feel the procurement process is working for them and if they have any suggestions how it can be improved.

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an mbeirt Air&iacute; as teacht anseo chun labhairt linn.  To begin with I will speak to a report and I commend my colleagues on the EU committee on the good and detailed report that was considered and developed a number of weeks ago.<\/p> <p>  It is startling how there are two classes of people in the country today, the insiders and the outsiders.  Most citizens have experienced approximately 31 separate price hikes over 2021 alone.  Farmers have experienced a tripling in the price of fertiliser and home energy costs have increased by 50%.  Inflation in November was at a 20-year high.  In real terms, the vast majority of citizens have seen their income and purchasing power reduced over the past 12 months.  These people have suffered in real terms.  The Government has refused to deal with that income reduction by postponing the increase in carbon tax.  It has refused to go to the EU to seek a VAT derogation on fuel, etc.  It has instead offered people approximately &euro;100 to deal with the staggering increases in the cost of living.<\/p> <p>  On the flip side there is another class of people, including a Secretary General who has seen an income increase of nearly 40% in the space of a year.  That income has gone from &euro;211,000 to &euro;298,000.  It would be a dream of most people in the country for that increase of almost &euro;90,000 to be their total income.  The report is quite clear that this was done and a figure was plucked out of the air without process or any international comparators.  The Government had no system that could be verifiable or comparable and which could be measured or challenged in any way.  The court of public opinion would see this as insiders very clearly looking after insiders.  Is the new salary of the Secretary General in question a benchmark for other salaries in the public service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#G00600","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will first comment on his earlier remarks and acknowledge that so many people across the country are really feeling the pressure of the inflation cycle we are currently experiencing.  It is higher than was envisaged and it is likely to remain higher for longer than anticipated.  In the budget last October, the forecast of the Department of Finance was that inflation would average approximately 2.2% across 2022 but it is now likely to be higher than that.  As we know from recent Central Statistics Office and EUROSTAT figures, it is well in excess of 5% in the most recent measurement.  That is a concern.<\/p> <p>  The Government responded in the budget, with the information we had at the time, with a package of well over &euro;1 billion on tax reductions, which many people across the House did not support.  It is one way of giving workers more money back in their pockets.  There were also targeted social welfare improvements.  Both measures amounted to well over &euro;1 billion, and many measures on the welfare side in particular were targeted, including the change that came into effect immediately on budget night extending the eligibility to the fuel allowance.  There were some very welcome changes to certain carer's allowances means tests and so on that had not been changed for well over a decade.<\/p> <p>  We made changes that will help but if the question is whether they go far enough, I believe we can never go far enough now given the current level of inflation.  We are conscious of it and it is why we are bringing forward the electricity credit of &euro;113.50, including VAT.  We will continue to keep that under review because we know people are feeling pressure now.  The issue is actively being examined and kept under review.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about a report and I acknowledge the work that went into it, as well as its findings.  The Deputy will have heard what I said earlier by way of action points that I am instituting as Minister, having considered the issues.  I relayed some background on this a year ago when I came before this committee on the matter.  There was a failed attempt to recruit a chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive in 2018 and the process had to be aborted because it was not possible to get a candidate.  The salary at the time was over &euro;300,000.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, it ended up being increased further for the present incumbent who successfully came through the process.  On the question of it becoming a reference point, I do not believe this is the case, nor have I seen evidence of it across the Civil Service or public service over the past 12 months.  I do not view it as a reference point.  A decision was taken given there was a vacancy in the Department at a time of national crisis.  The previous Minister and then Secretary General departed the Department of Health on the same day.  In the summer of 2020 there was a leadership vacuum.  There was no easy way to fill it or address it.  The view was arrived at that we wanted to go to the market to get the best candidate who put himself or herself forward.  It was agreed there would be an increased salary for the position of Secretary General in the Department of Health.  We know what happened subsequently.  We had the open competitive process.  Some months later an appointment was made.  It is important to make these points by way of context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#G00700","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Aire.

What he is saying is that the figure is not part of any process.  He is saying it is independent of any system or reference point and it is a personal deal.  The Minister is saying it is not possible to use this as a benchmark in future.  He is saying that if people argue their salary should be 90% of this salary he will not agree because this is a personal deal with a particular individual in a particular role that is insulated and isolated from the role of everybody else in the Civil Service.

There is no point in just firing questions at me and not allowing me the scope to answer them.  There was a very open and frank discussion at the meeting to which I referred a moment ago.  I believe the minutes of that meeting were provided to the committee and have been published.  A number of options were looked at at that time as to how the issue could be faced up to.  We were dealing with a global pandemic.  The Department of Health was under enormous strain and there was a leadership vacuum there.  Somebody was acting up and doing the very best they could, but there was a need for a permanent appointment.  The collective view arrived at was that in order to attract a top-quality candidate, there would be a need to go beyond the normal terms.  We discussed previous examples of that and the history of it.  As I said earlier, there was, in 2018, a failed attempt to recruit a CEO for the HSE on a salary that, I think, exceeded &euro;300,000.  That was the reality.  One of the options that was looked at was whether anyone from among all the existing Secretaries General would be interested in going into the role on a permanent basis.  In the round, however, the collective view was that an enhanced package was warranted and that there should be an open, public competition.  I was particularly keen, especially if we were to offer an enhanced package, that everyone should be given an opportunity to apply for the position.  That is subsequently what happened when that process took place in the subsequent months.  There was a lot of interest in the role, as one would expect, including a number of international candidates.  The candidates selected came through the top-level appointments committee process and through a number of interviews, and the Minister for Health was offered one name out of that process.  He then brought that name to the Government for approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#J01400","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>In fairness, the Minister had ample time to respond on that occasion.

The Minister mentioned the policy objectives: the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, reform of the health services, addressing waiting lists and dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic.  Nevertheless, the Secretary General could fail in all those respects.  He or she could oversee growing waiting lists, continued mismanagement and a move from one fiasco to another in the health services, but the Secretary General's salary would continue to grow and his or her pension entitlements would continue to be locked in regardless.

It is an expensive outcome for all sides and it is not something that anybody wants.  When that happens, it is important to examine, carry out an inquiry and find out what is the cause of that.  I guess that is why the report on the children's hospital was commissioned to see how things could be done differently.  I do not want to comment on that particular case but the Chairman has extended it to the more general case.<\/p> <p>  When people end up in litigation when they are in a contract with each other, it often comes down to a failure to disambiguate the terms at the start of the process and to make sure that people are not at cross purposes over what services or goods will be delivered and when, and that the contract is fully disambiguated as well.  I guess there is a learning for the Government and there is a learning for State agencies, and there is a learning as well for people who are bidding for contracts, in that.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked me what has been done to avoid that.  The commercial skills academy is an important part of that.  It is important that the specification of our projects in future is carefully done.  We have a number of new structures that have been put in place in the past couple of years to monitor very large procurement projects.  It has been a particular interest of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, to make sure that the very large projects that are included in the national development plan have monitoring processes in place to keep track of those projects and to make sure they are on track and that they do not drift off and move into protracted litigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#N00900","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State monitor the non-compliance with the procurement strategy that he has set out?

For example, if there is only one person who can offer that particular service, then there will not be a competition.  The result of that is the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes that report and it goes to the Committee of Public Accounts.  If one wants to compare across the different Departments and agencies, one can see who has the highest level of non-competitive contracts or non-compliant contracts.

We are therefore keen that we get small firms that successfully tender for business.  The majority of the spend on public procurement in Ireland goes to SMEs.  Most of it goes to companies that are situated within Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I regularly meet with representatives and I ask them what changes they would like to see in the procurement framework and in the way that we do our procurement.  They come to me with specific problems.  Over the last year, they have come to me with questions about inflation, professional indemnity insurance, Brexit, emergency procurement during Covid-19 and how they can bring contracts, for example, during the pandemic.  I meet with people who represent all of the different sectors.  For example, the Construction Industry Federation is there, as is the Small Firms Association, ISME and IBEC.  We have a co-operative relationship.  I am rarely unable to help them in their requests.  We work together to make sure that Irish companies get a fair share of the pie and they can competitively obtain contracts.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that I particularly want to do is to make sure that smaller, high-tech companies can win contracts for software services in Ireland.  This is because many of the most innovative companies tend to be fairly small.  We managed during the pandemic to award contracts in an emergency process to smaller companies.  We are looking at, for example, the strategic platforms for innovation and research in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and seeing if within that mechanism we can include more smaller high-tech companies in Government contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#O00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I should say to the Minister that at a private session today we agreed to review the Ministers and Secretaries Act.

The gross allocation for 2022 is just shy of &euro;597 million, which comprises &euro;143 million for flood risk management and &euro;454 million to be invested in estate management.<\/p> <p>  Given the recent easing of restrictions by Government, I pay tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works who maintained a full service for client Departments and the public during the pandemic.  Parks and heritage sites provided much-needed relief from the restrictions and the building and engineering services allowed Departments and local authorities to continue to deliver critical functions throughout the pandemic.  The OPW now stands ready to move forward in 2022 and I will now set out the investment priorities for the coming year.<\/p> <p>  The structure of the OPW Vote remains unchanged.  However, in line with the Government&rsquo;s infrastructure investment programme of &euro;165 billion under the National Development Plan 2021 to 2030, the OPW Vote has seen a 30% increase in its capital allocation.  This funding will contribute to the ambitious plan for a greener, more efficient, connected Ireland as part of our climate goal to cut emissions by 50% by 2030.<\/p> <p>  While the OPW funding allocations, projects and scope of work continue to expand, the two main strategic programmes of work on flood risk management and estate management have grown in parallel.  Since I last addressed this committee, the threat of climate change has been reinforced at events such as COP26.  It is clear the State needs to introduce measures to decarbonise but it also needs to introduce measures to adapt to the impacts of climate change.  As I have highlighted regularly, Ireland is an island and the sea is rising around us.  This is one of our greatest risks.<\/p> <p>  Under its flood risk management brief, the Office of Public Works continues to co-ordinate Ireland&rsquo;s whole-of-government approach to managing Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk from rivers and the sea, the primary source of Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk.  The OPW's core objective is to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the impact of flooding to the families and businesses in those communities known to be at significant risk from flooding.  I have seen at first hand the damage flooding can cause.<\/p> <p>  The flood risk management plans launched in May 2018 give evidence to support the Government&rsquo;s investment in flood risk management over the lifetime of the national development plan.  This investment supports the progression of some 150 flood relief schemes.  As Deputies know, delivering flood relief schemes is a very complex process, involving the following distinct stages: understanding the source and extent of flooding, identifying the preferred option to protect at-risk areas, securing the relevant consents and planning permissions, and constructing the scheme.  Throughout all stages, public consultation and detailed assessments of the environmental impacts are key to informing a flood relief scheme for a community.<\/p> <p>  Tomorrow, I will be visiting Bantry, County Cork, for the contract signing to appoint engineering and environmental consultants to progress a flood relief scheme for the town to protect 198 properties.<\/p> <p>  The prioritisation of schemes means work is now under way to protect 80% of at-risk properties with proposed solutions for the other 20%.  Flood risk projects require expert input and knowledge from engineers in hydrology.  As we progress future schemes, the Office of Public Works will continue to make the most efficient use of all available resources, including these specialised and limited personnel.<\/p> <p>  One of the greatest challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk comes from climate change.  In designing and building all our schemes, provision is made to ensure schemes can meet the risk posed by climate change.  The Office of Public Works assessment of that risk is fully supported by the evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.<\/p> <p>  Outside these major schemes, local authorities can address local flooding issues through funding from the OPW&rsquo;s minor floods mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  This provides 90% of the funding required by local authorities and, since 2009, has protected some 7,500 properties.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the major and minor flood relief schemes, the allocation of &euro;143 million to flood risk management in 2022 will allow the Office of Public Works to maintain some 11,500 km of channels and 800 km of embankments as part of its statutory maintenance duties.  This maintenance provides drainage outfall to 650,000 acres of agricultural lands and a level of protection from flooding to urban areas and critical infrastructure, including some 20,000 properties.<\/p> <p>  The second major OPW programme, estate management, continues to fund the design, upkeep and modernisation of a significant number of properties within the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  These include heritage sites, Civil Service office accommodation for all Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many State agencies.  In all, the OPW manages more than 2,500 properties on behalf of the State, which include some of Ireland&rsquo;s most significant heritage properties, monuments, gardens and arboreta.  Properties range from Leinster House to Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l and office buildings.  This management role includes the curation and presentation of 30 major historic properties and 700 national monuments as well as the State&rsquo;s art collection, artefacts, plants and trees.  This work makes a significant contribution to the health, enjoyment and well-being of the public, particularly in recent times and for which the OPW is quite rightly recognised.<\/p> <p>  I was especially pleased with the impact of the Government decision to waive entry fees to heritage sites in 2021.  Indications are approximately 8.5 million people visited our sites throughout the country over the past 12 months.  The initiative has reignited an appreciation for our heritage assets and refocused the idea of staycations.  This year the Office of Public Works will continue to be instrumental in the State commemorations marking the decade of centenaries with many events at OPW-managed sites, including the recent commemoration event at Dublin Castle, which was a tremendous success.<\/p> <p>  In 2022, Office of Public Works heritage sites will play a key role in the return of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism economy particularly with the opening to the public for the first time of Annes Grove gardens in north Cork and newly refurbished visitor exhibitions at the Blasket Centre in Kerry and C&eacute;ide Fields in Mayo.<\/p> <p>  In the context of office accommodation, the OPW is charged with designing the workplace of the future for the Civil Service.  It aims to deliver accommodation that allows more agile ways of working to meet our future needs.  Across 890,000 sq. m of office accommodation, the OPW continues to undertake the maintenance and constant updating of a diverse and complex portfolio of accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Deputies will be aware that, as a consequence of Brexit, physical infrastructure is required for customs, social protection services and health check controls at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport.  The Office of Public Works, on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and the Department of Transport, has delivered infrastructure at these ports and airports in the past two years.  The OPW will continue this important work in 2022.  The additional allocation of &euro;1.8 million in current resources will progress the project at Rosslare Europort under a new subhead funded by the Brexit Adjustment Reserve.<\/p> <p>  A gross sum allocation of &euro;454 million has been provided for estate management within the 2022 Revised Estimate.  A total of &euro;64 million of this has been allocated as part of the EU national recovery and resilience plan.  This funding was made available to Ireland to contribute to climate action projects.  This will ensure the Office of Public Works is well positioned to continue to contribute towards Europe&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives and support the recovery of the tourism sector and the wider economy.  Protecting the environment is at the heart of everything the OPW does in all aspects of our work, whether that be maintaining our national heritage sites or arterial drainage works.<\/p> <p>  I have only referred to a small section of the work of the OPW.  It goes without saying the scale and complexity of the OPW&rsquo;s responsibilities in the delivery of its two infrastructural programmes have a considerable impact nationwide and are dependent on its people.  The nature of the work of the OPW requires the input of a dedicated team of professional, technical and administrative staff, working in multidisciplinary teams, across a wide range of property management and engineering functions.  The roles cover professional managers, valuers, architects, engineers, mechanical and electrical specialists, surveyors, planners, financial advisers, property economists and project managers, supplemented by various other specialists as required.  These staff play a vital role in protecting, promoting and sustaining rural and urban areas.<\/p> <p>  I can say with confidence that the OPW stands ready to deliver key programmes for Government as outlined in 2022.  I would be happy to take any questions on the OPW&rsquo;s Revised Estimate requirements for 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#Q00200","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it.

He will be aware of recent media reports that a former senior civil servant and valuer with the OPW has written to leaders of different parties.  In a letter, he described a system that he called \"dysfunctional and wasteful\" and that he claimed had led to hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayers' money being wasted.  He stated that the \"exposure of persistent gross mismanagement\" of the portfolio in recent years had \"achieved nothing in the way of change\".  He listed a number of noteworthy examples: the overpayment of &euro;10 million by the State for the rental of the Department of Health's headquarters; the series of missed opportunities that saw the Garda missing out on, and being forced to vacate, its command headquarters on Harcourt Square in Dublin at a potential loss of over &euro;100 million; significant unutilised investment, notably a Georgian office complex on Merrion Square in Dublin that was purchased for &euro;23 million in 2007 and left vacant for seven years; the Hammond Lane site in north Dublin, which was purchased in the late 1990s, has never been used and has recently been earmarked as a site for a much-delayed new family courts complex; and the \"inexplicable\" way in which the OPW became involved in the children's science museum project on Earlsfort Terrace in central Dublin.  At the start of this week, there were media reports about a whistleblower who had made a protected disclosure to the Minister for Justice alleging that Legal Aid Board property leases worth millions of euro were \"unlawful\".  An allegation was also made about the use of an OPW building in County Kerry.<\/p><p> I wish to raise these matters with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, because he is before the committee.  I have a few questions on them.  In light of these claims in the media, the general conversation and the problems with the management of State properties as identified by a former senior civil servant in the OPW, what has he done to ensure that they do not arise again?  That is important, given that these are State assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#Q00300","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I am a Member of this House as well and I take allegations of that nature seriously.

Some do not involve the OPW at all despite being attributed to it.<\/p> <p>  I have answered questions on Miesian Plaza in the D&aacute;il.  The question of how two different measurement standards, for want of a better term, were attached while the lease was being negotiated has been well documented.  In the time since my appointment, the OPW has taken a proactive approach to engaging with the property owner on trying to make good, from the public's point of view, our long-term relationship with the owner while acknowledging that the owner has done nothing wrong.  Within the next number of weeks, although possibly longer than that, I hope that we might be in a position to bring forward some positive news about a different relationship between the OPW and the property owner.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referenced Hammond Lane and the family law courts.  The Courts Service, which is a separate entity to us, hopes to move forward with a planning application.  The Deputy also referenced the National Children's Science Centre.  It is an historical issue that somehow wound up with the OPW.  It is part of an arbitration process, so I am limited in what I can say.<\/p> <p>  Most of what has been raised in media commentary about property management is historical.  Some of it does not even relate to the OPW but the OPW has wound up with it and is now dealing with it.  Since my appointment, there has been a proactive response by the chairman, the commissioners and the senior staff in the organisation to dealing with legacy issues that have been left to the OPW's current management.  I am confident that procedures are in place to ensure such situations cannot arise again.  The team in the OPW must ensure safeguards are in place, in particular double-checking and cross-checking, because this is the public's money.  We are trying to ensure that we provide good office accommodation for our public services, not only in Dublin but the rest of the country as well, that there is a good blend of owned office and rented office accommodation, and that the organisation has the necessary skill set to do this.<\/p> <p>  Some of the issues that the Deputy raised have been aired on television or in the broadsheets.

More has been done to beef things up.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view as an organisation, we must take the public's trust seriously.  The OPW has a very strong brand, not only in terms of the flood alleviation work that we do in the Deputy's constituency and other constituencies, but in providing accommodation across the country.  We maintain 2,500 properties on behalf of the State.  There have been issues with a very small number of those - I believe the Deputy identified five.

They were barracks prior to the formation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so many of them do not have clean title.  Even if community groups or local authorities want to take them, many of them do not have clean titles.  In such circumstances, we have to establish title.  This means that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and others must try to establish title, which can take years because we are going back through defunct estates and it can take an awful lot of time.

Many people have many different perspectives about what should or, more importantly, should not happen.  You will always hear about what should not happen.  We know it is a very vulnerable part of the coast line, particularly around the Spanish Arch.  This area has many very old properties and residents and is really vulnerable.  The situation is not going to get better any time soon.  Great credit must go to Galway City Council for the interim measures it deploys, which work.  However, they only work up to a point.

Is it the legislation that we are saying is not up for negotiation by way of say, for instance, judicial review, or the communities whom we claim to represent?  I think that that is going to be fundamental to the people we represent.

We are playing Russian roulette with these communities unless we can get on and deliver to them.  However, we cannot deliver to them and pretend that the legislative basis on which we have been asked to deliver to them is fit for purpose.  It simply is not.  I know that people will cry foul of the Aarhus convention and all of that.  That is all very well and good when one has the Atlantic Ocean coming through your front door when you are living in the Claddagh.  There is no one going to say protect the Aarhus convention when there is a wave coming bursting through the front door in Salthill so we have to get real.  We cannot continue in the way that we are going.<\/p> <p>  As Minister with responsibility for the OPW, I must be honest with people.  I cannot protect the communities that I am being asked to protect while I have the legislative basis on which I am being asked to deliver on.  I ask my colleagues, as a Member of this House, to please bail me out.  The way that I need to be bailed is that I need a new legislative basis in the planning Acts.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, says that he is talking about a judicial review for housing that sounds like manna from heaven to me because everything that I am trying to get delivered across the country at the moment is tied up in court and the only beneficiaries that I seem to hear at the moment is not the people who must use pales to get water out of their houses but people who are in courtrooms.  The only people who seem to benefit from the work done by the OPW are the people who seem to be getting largesse out of courts and that is not sustainable.  It is not sustainable where we have communities waiting 20 years, and in some cases more years, for flood relief schemes, especially when we know that the sea is rising at the current rate.  A 1 metre rise in the Atlantic Ocean will wipe out whole communities on the west coast.  If I am saying to people in the Deputy's constituency, and in my constituency up the Shannon estuary, that they have to wait 20 years then they may as well start asking themselves if they are better off moving now because we will not be able to protect them.  This Oireachtas must respond in a positive way to climate change.  I do not mean to start saying how much emissions we will claim to cut and clapping ourselves on the back saying we are great for cutting emissions by 30% and 40%, and that means absolutely nothing.

Yes, is the short answer.  We have our own limitations.  We would like to have more outdoor staff and more craft workers.  We have the apprenticeship programmes that the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, resurrected when he had my role.  We definitely would like to have more such programmes, particularly stonemasonry as it is a craft for which the Office of Public Works is renowned.  Anybody who travels through the properties that the Office of Public Works is responsible for is in awe of the restoration works done by OPW staff.  The Vice Chairman need only look at sites in his own constituency to see an example of the work that the OPW can take pride in, whether it is historic properties, the national monuments or any of the buildings.

Private owners of listed properties have an obligation to ensure that they look after them to a given standard.  There is an obligation on us to look after them to a standard.  We receive properties into our possession on occasion.  I mentioned in my speech Annes Grove in County Cork.  I was there during lockdown.  Its story is one of lockdown, really.  It will be open shortly this year.  It is one of the newer properties in the sense that it is new to our portfolio.  Properties do come into our portfolio from time to time, but perhaps not as often as I would like.  Then again, we are not a bank.  We do not have deep pockets.  They are certainly not as deep as I would like to have.  However, where the attention of the State is drawn to particular properties, the chairman and the commissioners always evaluate them and make a decision in the best interest of the State.  When they make such a decision, they do so having weighed up the asking price and costs in the best interest of the State.  They routinely acquire property for the State.

The Minister of State referred to all of them in his opening remarks.  I just want more elaboration and meat on the bones.  The first point, which is pertinent, relates to commemorations and the important calendar of events over the past two years.  The events were held in very difficult circumstances.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could elaborate on the impact that Covid-19 has had on the commemorations in respect of his Department&rsquo;s need to be flexible.

As the Deputy knows, the OPW is an agency that supports the Department of the Taoiseach.  In many cases, we do much of the back-of-house work or donkey work for the commemorations.  We do all the heavy lifting and get none of the recognition, for want of a better way of putting it.  Most of the commemorations happen on properties run by the OPW.<\/p> <p>  May I use this opportunity to thank the OPW staff because it is they who do all the heavy lifting and the putting together of the nuts and bolts for many of the commemorations?  They bring in the outside bodies to put the events together.  Without them, we would not have what we see on television, namely showcase events that in many cases involve military precision.  The back-office teams at many of those events are the men and women of the OPW.  I pay tribute to them.  The events are routinely held in historical properties run by the OPW, most notably Dublin Castle.  Covid limits the number of people who can attend them.  Invitations are sent out primarily by the Department of the Taoiseach.  It would have the protocol people but we would have the people who do the heavy lifting in respect of the mechanics.<\/p> <p>  The years 2022 and 2023 will see the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department that is headed by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, leading the commemorations.  We are getting into the more difficult and sensitive commemorations, involving the outbreak of the Civil War and the events at the Four Courts.  We have a role in that we have already finished the restoration of the cupola at the Four Courts.  There will be a role for the OPW in future commemorations.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the party political element of commemorations, it is important to point out that I recently took the opportunity to remind political parties that there are State commemorations on State properties for a purpose.  I have asked them to be mindful that we would like State commemorations only on OPW properties and that we will not entertain party-political commemorations on them.  This is because the OPW properties are the properties of all of the people of the State.  They are the properties of people who vote for my party, every other party and no party.  For that reason, I wrote to all political parties and asked them to respect the fact that the properties are to be used to facilitate State commemorations and, in some cases, commemorations led by local authorities.  I asked them to respect these commemorations only and stated we will not be facilitating party-political commemorations.  That goes across the board.<\/p> <p>  The easier commemorations, covering the period from 1916 to 1919, when the First D&aacute;il was established, are now over.  It gets more difficult from now on.  That is why the staff of the OPW, in particular, must be respected by individuals of all political parties and none.  Events should be run in conjunction with the Department of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the local authorities only.  Everything else should be outside the gates, precincts or curtilage of the national monuments or State properties operated by the OPW, because they are the property of all the people regardless of who they vote for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#U00800","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I really appreciate that.

It relates to the construction and installation by the OPW, in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs and Excise, of Brexit infrastructure, be it at Rosslare Europort or Dublin Port.  It is hard not to refer to the really disappointing announcement made only in the last hour by the North's agriculture Minister that checks at the Port of Belfast are to be halted.  Those behind the announcement are daring the British Government to renege once again on an international treaty.  The work of the OPW to which I have referred is ongoing.  This work is not done only once in that constant modifications will be needed, particularly considering the much-needed and planned expansion of traffic through Rosslare Europort but also the potential for expansion at Dublin Port and possibly the Port of Cork and other ports.<\/p><p>I would appreciate if the Minister of State fleshed out the expected timeline the Department, in co-operation with Revenue, has for expected additional infrastructure.  Last week, I raised this with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in a discussion on Estimates and expected staffing requirements for Revenue.  It will be the same for the OPW.  What further work is possibly required?  Is this issue something that receives ongoing updated analysis?

He is absolutely right.  We have an ambitious programme for Rosslare Europort.  The Deputy is also right that this is not an insignificant investment that we are about to embark on.  It involves the OPW, Irish Rail, Wexford County Council, the local community, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Revenue Commissioners and a host of local agencies.  The investment is enormous by local standards.  It is worth &euro;150 million.  It represents a site of 10,700 sq. m. made up of 19 buildings that will provide a new border control for the country.  We have seen the traffic into and out of Rosslare Europort in recent months.  The additional new services operated in the port dictate we have to provide additional new services for hauliers coming in and out of there.  The OPW has been charged with this.  The spend to date by our Brexit unit on a range of measures is &euro;81 million.  This is capital spending across all of the headings provided for.<\/p> <p>  In his question the Deputy mentioned the work we have done on Dublin Port.  Our short-term ambition for this set of Estimates is focused on Rosslare.  We see the potential for Rosslare to be an additional node into the country and the additional border control point we need given the traffic being generated through the port.  We know remote access from the port causes difficulties in terms of time delays.  It is about ease of access out of the port.  Wexford County Council, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the hauliers will provide support in terms of anecdotal evidence, as will Revenue and other port users, as to the final design.  This will be supported by the European Union and will represent a massive investment into County Wexford.  The Deputy has seen the scale and finished product of what the OPW did in Dublin Port.  Other Deputies may not have seen it.  The manner in which we were able to turn it around and the speed with which we were able to turn it around are a credit to OPW staff, including our internal architects and engineering staff.  We were asked to do it in a very short period of time.

It is an issue I raised with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, last week.  It is on remote working and encouraging a move in the Civil Service to achieve 20% of staff working remotely.  The Minister of State referenced it briefly in his remarks.  The detail is quite important with regard to how it can be achieved and how the Civil Service can be a model for the semi-State sector and the private sector.  This is something worth pursuing.  It is doable and affordable.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would elaborate on the strategy for remote working being co-ordinated in terms of being facilitated by the OPW.

It is up to every Department to identify how it will manage it.  It is then up to us when asked how we will support it.  We already support not only our own staff to work from home but we have also supported other Departments in this regard.  There will be fundamental questions on office accommodation in this city.  If we are going to have hybrid working environments there will be a requirement for the Government as an employer to have discussions with our employees on the type of working environment we will have.  If 20% of people will be in a different type of working environment there will be a question as to whether we will own the buildings or lease the buildings.  There will be different types of conversations not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  Someone in Longford or Sligo may be working for the Department of Social Protection.  Wherever people are they will be in an OPW-owned, operated or leased building.  This will happen organically over a period of time.  It will require conversations between us and the parent Departments once the parent Departments have worked out what hybrid working looks like for them.<\/p> <p>  I have had this discussion with our internal management board and the chairman.  We need to start looking at other elements of the public sector, such as local authorities and other State agencies.  We have begun to look at partially filled buildings that house local authority buildings, semi-State companies or public agencies.  We are looking for Civil Service gaps to be filled by people working in a different environment, such as somebody who might be looking for a remote working environment in Stillorgan.  We know the local authority does not have full capacity in that area.  We need to start seeing the Civil Service and public sector as \"Ireland Inc.\" rather than two different entities.  We need to start looking at how we can collaborate all of our working environments as one \"Ireland Inc.\" working environment.  We need to make sure we maximise all of these working spaces before we start looking at building any more.  This is very important.  It is something the OPW has already started to do in regional Ireland.  We need to see whether workspace is available from local authorities, the HSE and other State agencies before we start going off entering into leases, buying buildings or building buildings.<\/p> <p>  This is what hybrid working and various forms of working will look like as well as working from home.  People have jumped to a conclusion that hybrid working will be working from home.  It will also be about remote working and working in a local authority office but being a civil servant or being a local authority employee working in a Civil Service office.  We have to be open to change.  A motor tax official for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council could be working beside somebody from the Department of Social Protection.  We are all working for \"Ireland Inc.\" and we should be prepared to look at these models and not be so protective of the type of offices we are working in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#V00400","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The main issue we have is planning-related.  These are major schemes so when we anticipate, as we do, we plan on the basis of a forecast that things will move along smoothly and, naturally enough, we will build into our capital plan a sufficient amount to allow for that.  For instance, the profile for 2019 to 2021 combined Crossmolina, Glashaboy, Enniscorthy and the River Poddle.  When the four of them are put together, there is a combined underspend coming in of approximately &euro;75 million.  All of those schemes are at different stages.  We could get into each one individually to see where they are or, more important, where they are not.<\/p> <p>  We have to build into our profile each year a sufficient money for each one of them to be able to proceed because we do not know what is out there on the horizon, or what rock one of them will hit, during the planning process.  We have to build a sufficient amount of capital into our profile to allow them to move on.  We hope and anticipate that they will move smoothly.  Unfortunately, some of them are fairly big in scale, such as Enniscorthy, a town with a population upwards of 10,000 people.  These are not small schemes but major ones.  We are carrying over capital for fairly substantial population bases.  We do not want to carry over that capital, but we are doing so due to factors outside our control, primarily judicial review.  As I said to the Deputy's party colleague earlier, I hope that as part of the upcoming legislative review in this context we will get to a situation where we will not have towns throughout the country that are waiting more than 20 years for flood relief schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#W00200","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I understand that.

It was the same situation when former Deputy Moran held this portfolio.  The problem has been going on for years.

Unfortunately, that did not materialise due to an issue on the part of the community group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#Y02200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I can understand that because the community groups are taking on a fair burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#Y02300","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Yes, exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022020200002#Y02400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1643760000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>We will engage with the Department of Education and the patron in the full knowledge that the patron would be taking on the liability of the building.

We do not have many deep sea ports in Kildare.  We have quite a number of harbours, albeit canal harbours, but they are still there.  In regard to the development of facilities for educational and tourism purposes, however, we have quite a number of historic houses, some of which are under the guidance of the OPW already.  Moneys have been spent and continue to be spent.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the Morell River drainage scheme was held up by judicial review.  I understand it is now going ahead.<\/p> <p>  As one drives around the country, there are houses that catch one's eye.  A few of them are in County Kildare.  Is there a mechanism for houses that might be at risk of disappearing into decay and disrepair?  Some of them may be on private property, which creates a problem.  Some of them may be on public property, which does not create a problem.
