It relates to Scoil Cara in Cork city.  The school started off in 2011 with 30 students.  It now has 72 students for 2019.  This Commencement matter relates to children with special needs and the need for adequate services to be put in place.  My question this morning is about the adequate provision of people who can provide therapeutic services.  I understand that there is a certain guideline as regards the number of hours that should be made available for each child.  The staffing levels at the moment are not adequate to provide that level of therapeutic services for these children.  In fairness to them, parents are working very hard with the board of management and the principal of the school to make sure that the best possible education and support is provided for these students, but one of the key elements of the children's development is the provision of these services.  I understand there has been a difficulty in getting the necessary support.  I know this area covers two Departments in the sense that the Department of Education and Skills would be involved in respect of the school while the support services come under the Department of Health and the HSE.  Can something be done to make sure we provide the adequate support services for these children?  If we provide them now, when the children are very young, there will be huge long-term benefits.  Long-term costs are also reduced when the services are produced at a very early stage.  It is in that context that I am raising this issue with the Minister of State this morning.  Raising it is urgent because it is important that no time is lost in providing these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#A00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, I am happy to provide an update to the House on therapeutic services in Scoil Cara junior school.  As the Senator may be aware, Scoil Cara is one of a number of primary schools for children with autism in Cork.  It was established in 2011, as outlined by the Senator, following a decision to divide Scoile Triest into a junior cycle school and a senior cycle school.  Scoil Triest now provides special education to children with autism and mild to moderate intellectual disabilities who are aged 12 to 18 years.  Scoil Cara provides special education to children with autism and mild to moderate learning difficulties aged five to 12 years.  Both schools are under the patronage of the Brothers of Charity.  The multidisciplinary supports provided to pupils of Scoil Cara include two days of speech and language therapy and two days of occupational therapy.  Alongside this, psychology and physiotherapy services are provided on referral.  These multidisciplinary resources were assigned to the school when it was established with 30 pupils in six classes back in 2011.  However, the school now has 60 pupils in ten classes and, unfortunately, the Brothers of Charity services have not been able to increase the level of multidisciplinary support to the desired levels over the years.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, the demand for therapy services has grown alongside significant year-on-year increases in the number of children applying for assessment, including assessment for autism spectrum disorder and disability services generally.  The HSE recognises that services for school aged children with disabilities and early intervention services are paramount and need to be improved and organised more effectively.  This process is well under way nationwide.  HSE disability services is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multidisciplinary, geographically-based teams as part of its national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people aged up to 18 years.  The key objective of this programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.  Evidence to date from areas where this has been rolled out shows that implementation of this programme will also have a positive impact on waiting lists both for assessments and therapies.  The HSE is working towards having the progressing disability services model in place in Cork by the second quarter of 2019.  It is expected that this will facilitate access to therapies for all children with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#A00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The Senator may ask a brief supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#B00100","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

One of the people providing therapeutic services in that school has retired or resigned and there has been difficulty in appointing a replacement.  It is so important for the children.  Any parent with a child with a disability works extremely hard to give that support to children.  The parents are giving their support and I note that the Brothers of Charity have done a huge amount of work in this area over a long number of years.  However, it is important the State gives the necessary support, especially when a school has made so much progress in a very short period in terms of expansion and the growing of services.  The key element is the therapeutic service.

Spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, is a group of inherited diseases of the motor nerves that cause very debilitating muscle weaknesses and wasting.  It is life threatening, rare and the leading cause of death in infants and toddlers.  There are 25 children in this country with this condition.  It presents them with several burdens.  They are wheelchair bound, suffer muscle recession and considerable pain and the day-to-day exercise of their lives is virtually impossible in things such as handwriting and other small things.  I have met some of their family members.  All they want is to give their children the best life they can.<\/p> <p>Hope for these children comes in the form of Spinraza, the first treatment of its kind in the world.  There is significant evidence from countries across the world, and from clinical trials, that Spinraza is changing children's lives significantly, slowing down muscle wastage and, in many cases, allowing muscle strengthening to occur which allows them to live a much more active, healthy life.  Grace O'Malley from Robeen near Ballinrobe in County Mayo, along with her parents Paul and Lorraine, and other family members of those suffering from SMA are begging for access to this drug.  They know it will not cure Grace but they also know from the CHERISH trial results, which outline the effectiveness of Spinraza, that these are the children who are most at risk of losing the muscle function which Spinraza has the potential to greatly manage and to improve Grace's condition and afford her some level of independence.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, Ireland entered an international alliance with the Benelux countries which was said would strengthen Ireland's hand in negotiations with big pharmaceutical companies.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, hailed it as an agreement that would improve Irish patients' access to new and innovative drugs.  I, like many others, am waiting to see the fruits of this arrangement.  The Minister's repeated reference to the Netherlands and Belgium negotiating for Spinraza prior to Ireland joining the Benelux countries' initiative is misleading and confusing, considering the statement from Biogen on 20 September which said that in July 2018, Ireland was offered the same terms as other countries, regardless of the time of joining the initiative.<\/p> <p>The latest information received by the families is that Spinraza has been referred to the rare diseases technical review committee.  They have questions to which I would like answers.  Who forms this committee?  How does it differ from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, assessment?  I understand that Professor Michael Barry is the head of the NCPE and the rare disease review committee, which raises a question about the impartiality of this whole process.  As there is no new medical information to consider since the original dossier was presented to the NCPE, what exactly will it consider?  The evidence will be the same as will the people.  Will this review group engage with the patients?  Has a timeframe been put on the assessments given the very serious nature of the disease?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#B00400","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Swanick for raising this matter.<\/p> <p>Spinraza is indicated for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, a disorder characterised by progressive muscle atrophy and weakness.

I fully appreciate that SMA sufferers and their families face enormous day-to-day challenges in dealing with this progressive and debilitating condition.<\/p> <p>Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish health service.  The challenge is to deliver on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way.  The Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate.  The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in making a reimbursement decision, which include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.<\/p> <p>In reaching its decision, the HSE will examine all the relevant evidence and take into account such expert opinions and recommendations that are appropriate, including from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.

If there are any specific questions, it would be more appropriate to direct them to the HSE because neither I nor the Minister have any role or function in this process.  That has been a decision taken by the House.  The Senator said price should never be a barrier when it comes to the health of children.  The State is not going to approach drug companies, which are part of a multi-billion euro industry, with that mantra and suggest that price will never a barrier to approving any drug.  That would be reckless, irresponsible and dangerous in the extreme.  As these are powerful multinational companies - multi-billion euro companies - that have a lot to gain, there is a healthy tension there that demands time and necessitates things being done properly and a process that is held up to scrutiny, transparency, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness because, as the Senator and all of us here are aware, there are many competing demands on the limited resources that are available to the HSE on an annual basis for the delivery of services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#B00700","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>This cohort of patients is very small.

I am advised that the University Limerick hospital group recognises the need for the appointment of a clinical nurse specialist post in neurology.  The national clinical programme for neurology clearly outlines the resource requirements for the neurology service across the University Hospital Limerick site and nationally to achieve the best outcomes for neurology patients in line with best international practice.  The neurology model of care also recommends the appointment of a clinical nurse specialist as part of a multidisciplinary team treating patients with MS.  It is in this context that the University Limerick hospital group has taken the decision to prioritise the recruitment of an MS nurse.  I understand a job application for this position has been finalised by the University Limerick hospital group for submission to the HSE national recruitment service.<\/p> <p>It is timely for me to use this opportunity to update the House on developments with the model of care for neurology services.  The national clinical programme for neurology has developed and published a model of care for neurology services, which provides a framework for neurology services to be delivered through an integrated service approach.  It is intended that such services will be delivered in an efficient, equitable manner by supported, skilled professionals working in a multidisciplinary manner using a person-centred approach to care.  The model of care promotes best practice in the delivery of neurology services by adopting key international standards and promoting support for evidence-based and research-led practice throughout the service.  At the centre of the model of care for neurology is the role of cohesive and comprehensive multidisciplinary team care in the management of patients.  The model envisages audiologists, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and other health and social care professionals working with patients and collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing optimal care for patients in the Irish healthcare system.  <\/p> <p>The purpose of the clinical nurse specialist post within this broader team is to improve and enhance the care of patients and their families by improving existing services and developing new services with regard to neurology and to assist overall in optimising the quality and continuity of care.  The clinical nurse specialist will work as a key member of the multidisciplinary team in the hospital service providing physical, psychological and emotional support to neurology patients and their families.  He or she will act as a liaison between community services, primary care teams and other agencies.  <\/p> <p>It is my understanding that the University Limerick hospital group will continue to work with the national clinical programme for neurology and is prioritising the recruitment of the clinical nurse specialist post within that context to progress the need for further strategic development of neurology services in the mid-west region.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#C00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I note the Minister of State acknowledged how the important the service provided by the MS specialist nurse is.

It took three years from that point for the family to be connected with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI.  That is the organisation which provides practical support for people with sight loss, puts programmes in place to advise them and connects them to low vision aids, low vision supports and peer counselling.

Over the last couple of years, NCBI has endeavoured to have a sight loss adviser appointed to most of the hospital groups in this country to engage with parents who get devastating news.  They will also engage with adults who are told they are going blind or are losing their sight in a way that is going to have a life-lasting effect.  If there is an adviser, at least people can get supports quickly.  They can be equipped to come to terms, as best they can, with the new reality of their lives.<\/p><p>Some of the hospital groups in this country are very proactive in doing that but some are not.  It should be compulsory that there is a sight loss adviser in all the hospital groups.  I was very tempted to table an amendment to the Children's Health Bill 2018 to ensure it was enshrined in legislation that a sight loss adviser would be appointed to the national children's hospital when it is eventually built.  I hope that will not be necessary and that it would happen as a matter of form.  The quicker people get interventions, the faster and easier they can adapt their lives to dealing with their new reality.  I often say we should get our eyes checked on a regular basis because the faster a deterioration is identified, and the quicker supports and interventions put in place, the better chance there is of eyesight being retained.<\/p><p>That extends to a situation where a person finds he or she has lost his or her sight.  In order for his or her quality of life to be maintained as best it possibly can be - and it can be because there are plenty of supports - the sooner interventions happen from a mental health perspective and from a practical perspective, the better.  That is especially the case with young children.  The quicker they get supports such as low vision aids and the faster they connect with the various suites of supports that exist, the better the chance they have of adapting to the reality they face for the rest of their lives.  I sincerely hope the Government will see the logic of what I consider a practical step to connect the NGO structures and the various other structures when it comes to visually-impaired teaching services, etc.  I await the reply of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#C00900","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to provide an update to the House.  This Government is committed to delivering disability services that are person-centred and putting those who need supports at the centre of our focus.  We want to empower people to live independent lives by improving access to the services they require.  The 2016 census figures indicate 54,810 people, or 1.2% of the population, have a sight-related disability.  This represents a 6% increase since 2011.  These people have the right to the same access to healthcare services as everyone else.<\/p> <p>In 2015, the Health Service Executive published \"Guidelines on accessible health and social services\".  The guidelines were developed by the HSE in consultation with the National Disability Authority to give practical guidance to all health and social care staff about how they can provide accessible services to all.  The key message in these guidelines is ask, listen, learn, plan and do.  Communication with patients is key to being able to plan appropriate supports to improve accessibility.  From access to buildings to managing appointments and communicating clearly with patients, the HSE is committed to ensuring that access to services is a priority.<\/p> <p>Within acute hospitals and across the hospital groups, access officers support staff in dealing with matters where additional support or guidance is needed.  Where gaps exist, access officers are working to address systematically the gaps and ensure future services and facilities comply with national guidelines, standards and legislation.  The quality improvement division within the HSE is working in partnership with patients and families to improve the quality and safety of care for patients.  The National Council for the Blind of Ireland has also developed specific information resources for healthcare professionals working closely with the HSE to provide input and invaluable advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#D00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the update on what is probably a new way of thinking.

I know the NCBI certainly provides supports, both human and financial, in this scenario.  This, however, is something to which we will come back.  It is also something I will be monitoring closely because I really believe in the concept of early interventions right across the board.  I know the Minister of State does as well because we regularly speak about the importance of early interventions.  I refer to when there is a deterioration in somebody's health, in whatever shape or form it happens.  Society needs to click in, help and support.  The Minister of State's answer is in that vein and that is the type of policy we need to look at moving forward.  We have to take a holistic approach.  If a person finds that he or she has a disability, then we must have a holistic approach as to how we can ensure his or her ability rises to the top and he or she can overcome his or her disability.

The flooding is largely due to the lack of investment in local and regional roads.  Some &euro;40 million was announced in the budget in that regard but hundreds of millions of euro have been cut from the local and regional roads budgets in recent years while we nationalised the debt of the banks.

The flooding is serious because it led to entire communities being cut off from Mayo University Hospital.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister visit County Mayo.

We now have a hard-won template such that the visually impaired can for the first time vote privately and confidentially in a referendum, although not yet in other elections.

I am dealing with a case involving an individual who is not from my constituency and who contacted me having waited eight weeks a claim to be processed.  I raised this issue two weeks ago in another context but it does not seem that the situation has improved since then.  Members have been told in reply to parliamentary questions and in the most recent statement by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which was published on its website on 21 September, that the delays result from the introduction of a computerised programme to process these payments.  It is no longer good enough that people have to wait a significant number of weeks to claim a basic payment from the Department.<\/p> <p>The illness benefit is a payment for a person who is sick and cannot work.  Such people pay into the system and expect a service in return.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->My understanding is that the delays arise from the lack of negotiations with GPs on the transition from a paper form to an online process.  From talking to GPs, my understanding is that very little in the way of negotiations has taken place.  The Department and the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, had looked at appointing a mediator to resolve the issues they had but the idea was pulled at the last minute.  In the meantime, thousands of people are waiting for illness benefit payments to be made to them.  These people are in very difficult circumstances but the only response from the Department is to go and see the community welfare officer.  Nobody wants to have to go to see the community welfare officer to enable themselves to make ends meet while they await the processing of a payment.  I ask for the Minister to ensure sufficient staff are allocated to the illness benefit processing section of the Department and to allow claims made on the old forms to be processed forthwith, because there are many people who have been living on the clippings of tin over the past few weeks awaiting their payment.  This is something this House can unite on so I ask it to appeal to the Minister to ensure there are sufficient staff to process these payments.  People have been waiting far too long for payments to which they are entitled through the stamps they have paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#H01400","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I want to refer to an issue raised by Senator Conway-Walsh and by Senator Swanick on a Commencement matter earlier relating to the drug Spinraza which could transform the lives of a small number of children and adults.

The advice of the HSE and the NCCP is taken on board because new drugs come onto the market every day and the Minister cannot be involved in all of the decisions but the issue here is the vacuum and the delays for the parents of the children involved.  I know some of the families involved in Mayo and they have told me of the uncertainty and the lack of information or timelines.

I also ask the Leader to urge the Minister to get the HSE to give information to the families when a decision is made.  It is available in 20 other countries and it would not compromise any negotiations to say that, if the drug companies are looking for a higher price for Ireland than in the other countries, it should be brought out into the open.

FEMPI has destroyed general practice, particularly in remote areas and in deprived urban areas.  It is not possible to take &euro;2 billion out of general practice without it having devastating effects on the health service.  Every &euro;1 spent in primary care saves &euro;5 in the rest of the health service.  Almost 12 months ago, in November 2017, the Minister for Health signalled his intention to commence the reversal of the FEMPI cuts to GPs and announced that he would engage with GP representative bodies next year with the aim of establishing a new contract and an approach to multi-annual fees in 2019.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister, following his announcement last year that he would engage with GP representative bodies, how many meetings or engagements he has had and what progress there has been.  In a response to Deputy Harty in August, the Minister said he had had only two face-to-face meetings with the IMO representatives this year and none with the NAGP.  The NAGP has been excluded thus far and I want to see genuine action on these talks.  They are emergency talks because general practice has been decimated over the past number of years.

For instance, this morning Voxpro announced 400 new jobs in Cork.  The company started off in Cork with a small number of staff.  It was built by people from Cork and it now employs more than 3,000 people in Cork and Dublin.  Overall it has more than 5,000 employees.  That started off with two or three people and it has now grown substantially.  It shows the positive way in which the economy has been managed over the past seven years because, despite the threat of Brexit people, feel confident that they can invest in new jobs in Ireland.<\/p> <p>There are many challenges in Dublin because of the cost of accommodation and the cost of setting up but Cork is an attractive place for companies to locate in.  For example, 1 Albert Quay is a building that has been completed beside the railway station and it accommodates more than 1,700 office workers.  When all the other projects are completed in the area, there will be more than 10,000 people working in offices within five minutes walking distance of the train station in Cork, which shows the confidence that people have in the region.  One of the challenges that we now need to deal with is to make sure that we have adequate residential accommodation for those people who want to take up employment in Cork.  We need to work on that area.  One of the significant complaints at the moment relates to residential accommodation.  The cost of building apartments is way in excess of what can be recovered from their sale.  I call on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come to the House to debate what we can do to help deal with that issue and to make sure that building apartments for this new spurt in population is a viable proposition and that they can be built in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#K04300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The report that came out today entitled, Growing Up in Ireland: The lives of 13 year olds, informs us about what we need to do in policymaking, legislation and collecting data on a range of issues in the areas of health, physical development, social and emotional well being, schooling and learning, etc.  Of significance in that report is obesity among children.  Some 20% of children in that age group are considered overweight with more than 6% being clinically obese.  Most notable is the disparity between the children's weight and how they perceive themselves.  It is often termed weight blindness.  I bring this up because, as Senator Dolan alluded to, today is UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty and poverty is  highlighted in this report.

For people in Monaghan who wish to use Bus &Eacute;ireann, the main bus travelling to Dublin is the Letterkenny to Dublin express, which stops in Monaghan.  Last week an 84 year old lady was planning on going to Dublin Airport using Bus &Eacute;ireann services to catch a flight.  She stood at the side of the road along with a few others and waited for the bus to come for almost an hour.  When the bus eventually arrived, the bus driver pulled up to inform her that there were no seats available on the bus.  In a panic she had to ring a neighbour to rush her to the airport in order to catch her flight.  I can only imagine the stress and annoyance that would have caused that 84 year old lady.  For the people of Monaghan, the only show in town for those using public transport is buses.  Surely the Leader will agree that some form of update should be provided to people, or some form of tracking device should be used, in order that people would know whether the bus is going to be five minutes late or, in some cases, over an hour late and whether there is any space on the bus.  We can imagine that if people are using bus services to catch a flight or, like many people at present, to travel to hospital appointments in Dublin, or are among the many students who travel to college daily, it is important to know whether there is space available on a bus or whether it will appear at all.<\/p> <p>It is an issue that needs to be tackled.  I met the chief executive officer recently, who informed me that Bus &Eacute;ireann planned to increase the daily services from Letterkenny to Dublin, which would have facilitated the people of Monaghan.  He told me those services would be in place by September at the latest.  It is now heading towards November and there is still no sign of those services.  Clearly people are losing confidence in Bus &Eacute;ireann and in the service it provides to the public.  With that in mind I ask that the Leader invite the Minister into the House in order that we can address the issue to ensure that the people of Monaghan who wish to travel to Dublin and who have no other choice but to use buses can at least be sure the bus will arrive when it is meant to arrive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I call on Senator Derek Warfield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Did the Leas-Chathaoirleach say \"Derek\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L00400","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I am sorry; I meant \"Fintan\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L00500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach is a secret Wolfe Tones fan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L00600","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>The Senator understands the slip.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I did not think the Leas-Chathaoirleach was a Wolfe Tones fan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L00800","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I have indeed been known to tune in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L00900","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I always enjoyed my time in the Gleneagle.  I will speak briefly.  I am very disappointed this morning to hear that the plan for a civic plaza at College Green has been turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This issue is about the &euro;10 million proposal to pedestrianise the space in front of Trinity College, to the side of Bank of Ireland and up Dame Street and to turn the area into a vibrant, car-free, child-friendly central plaza for Dublin city.  The space was identified as potentially the most important civic space in Dublin by Dublin City Council's public realms strategy in 2012.  It is hugely important in terms of building Dublin as a liveable city.  I have not yet read the report in full, only the reasons and considerations.  The report was released this morning.  It throws it back to Dublin City Council to go back to the drawing board again to sort out what An Bord Plean&aacute;la considered to be significant shortcomings associated with the traffic modelling and the effects of bus rerouting.  The people of Dublin deserve a city that flows, in that they can get where they want to go, but it should be a liveable, child-friendly, pedestrian city.

It provides an excellent service in the main but there are some difficulties.<\/p> <p>Last August, An Post announced the names of 156 post offices which were to be closed in the Twenty-Six Counties over a period of months.  It also announced an appeal mechanism and the criteria such post offices had to meet to appeal that decision.  In spite of a detailed submission by Killeshandra Community Council, which clearly outlined the huge range of business activities in the town and the wide diversity in commerce and enterprise, its appeal was turned down.  The council was informed of that in recent days.  Like any rural community, there is a large cohort of older people.  Unfortunately, in many instances, they do not have their own transport or access to technology.  At a recent public meeting held in the town, which was attended by my colleagues, Councillors Sean Smith and John Paul Feeley, there was a determination in that community that its post office should remain open.  It was doing excellent business and the local community was, and is, using it to a large extent.  The community felt that its post office met the criteria for an appeal but unfortunately, as I said, it was turned down in recent days.  In a recent D&aacute;il debate my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, outlined clearly to the Minister that in assessing the need for a post office facility, An Post should factor in the population of the town and its hinterland.  I believe that Killeshandra meets and met all of the necessary criteria.  Unfortunately it was unsuccessful.  <\/p> <p>I appeal to the Leader to facilitate the new Minister to come to the House in order for us to outline to him our views, and to get his views, in respect of the appeals process because it is obviously not adhering to its own criteria.  I would appreciate it if we could look to the future of our post offices and not the past, as is normally the response from Government representatives in both Houses.  Unfortunately, the Leader meets those criteria.  I would like to look to the future and, if there are criteria set aside for appeals and communities meet them, those communities should be successful, not unsuccessful.  We want the Minister in here to discuss that process in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L01100","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Like other colleagues, I am very disappointed that the plaza on College Green is not going ahead.

Political accountability is a good thing, not a bad thing.  There is no political accountability for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am open to correction but I do not believe An Bord Plean&aacute;la has ever come into the Houses of the Oireachtas to answer questions on some of the decisions it makes.  Perhaps it is precluded from doing so.  If that is the case perhaps we need to change the legislation in that area.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak on another issue I know will be close to an Leas-Chathaoirleach's heart, because he comes from a county that benefits greatly from tourism, which creates thousands of jobs throughout the west coast.  We have done so well from initiatives like the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and so on.

Additional resources for the programme were announced in the budget, which is very welcome.  We could be doing more to promote the greenways.  In County Clare, we have a walk along the Cliffs of Moher that goes from Hag's Head as far as Doolin.  It is between 8 km and 10 km in length and thousands of people do it every year.  The walk requires significant investment.  Some 1.5 million people frequent the Cliffs of Moher visitor experience each year.  A proportion of the resources generated by the facility needs to be redirected into upgrading the cliff walk and enhancing the partnership that already exists between the local community and farmers and the State agencies which promote the walk.  The farmers need to see a greater dividend.  The walkway needs to be upgraded and significant money needs to be spent on it.  The Minister needs to come before the House and provide an overall presentation on greenways and walkways.  In the course of that, he might be kind enough to outline his plans for the future of the Cliffs of Moher walk in County Clare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#L01200","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I also want to mention College Green.

I have no comment to make on the circumstances of the resignation of the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.  In his capacity as Minister, I found Deputy Naughten very forthcoming, available and engaging and I want to give him credit, particularly for the hands-on approach he took to trying to secure energy supply and security in the Shannon Estuary.  He was very involved in a project that is close to my heart, namely, that relating to liquefied natural gas, LNG.  Unfortunately, that project has once again been delayed by an objection.  I hope that when there is an outcome in that regard, the new Minister, Deputy Bruton, might come to the House and take up from where the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, left off.<\/p><p>I want to bring the attention of the House to an article by Simon Carswell in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It includes an interview with Mary Casey of Inniskeen, County Monaghan, regarding the death of her father, Johnny, in a tragic appalling murderous act carried out by the IRA on August 22, 1972, when it exploded a bomb at a Border crossing in Newry.  The explosion resulted in the deaths of eight people, including Mary's father, who was an innocent lorry driver who had stopped to get his documents in order.  The article is very interesting.  It brings to mind all of the atrocities committed by the IRA and its equally mad counterparts on the extreme unionist side.  It is important that we dwell on these things, especially at a time when there is a lot of loose talk about Brexit.  I have heard some outrageous comments by Neanderthal British politicians about letting the Irish shoot it out among themselves.  There have been equally irresponsible comments from the other side, with people stating that it is time to take advantage, have a Border poll and get a united Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They should read the newspaper article in question today.

I hope it will look favourably on the request.<\/p> <p>Senators Conway-Walsh and Paddy Burke raised the issue of flooding and roads in Mayo.  I do not want to get into a particular argument but I am not sure where Senator Conway-Walsh is in terms of investment in our regional and national roads.  As Senator Paddy Burke rightly said, an extra &euro;286 million has been made available in the national planning framework for roads.  Part of the difficulty we have with the opening of drains is due to issues with the freshwater pearl mussel.  It is also about local authorities, farmers and landowners being proactive.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>Senators Dolan and Devine raised the issue of child poverty and that today is the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.  The Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Employment Affairs and Social Protection are acutely conscious of the need to have more young people out of poverty.  That is why we have seen an increase across the board in social welfare payments. Changes have been made to a plethora of schemes such as the back-to-school allowance, access to childcare, school meals, lone-parent's allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has an allocation of &euro;127 million for affordable childcare and &euro;89 million in addition to being able to change access routes for childcare.  I would be happy to have a debate on the matter.  One person in poverty is one too many.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan raised the important issue of access to voting and that there are outstanding issues relating to access to polling stations in 11 constituencies.  We should welcome the independence given to people who are visually impaired when voting.  It should be extended to all elections.  We need to see returning officers making decisions at a local level with regard to where they locate polling stations.  If they are not wheelchair accessible or disabled person friendly, then they should not be used as a polling station.  Extending the voting franchise through the postal system for people who are housebound or who may find it difficult to get to a polling stations should be looked at.  If other countries can do it, I do not see why we cannot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#N02900","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I requested that the Minister might attend the House on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#N03000","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I am happy to facilitate that request.<\/p> <p>Senator Nash raised the problems with illness benefit payments.

The second is disease management and the third is to make existing GP practices sustainable, which is what we hope to do.

I could nearly have honorary membership at this stage as I am in here a lot at the moment.  I thank Members for considering this Bill and giving it a Second Reading.  This is a short, technical Bill with only five sections.  It provides for the amendment of certain provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which relate to the recognition of non-Irish professional qualifications.<\/p> <p>Before explaining the Bill in more detail, I will provide the House with some background to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which this Bill seeks to amend, and a brief update on its implementation to date.  The Act currently provides for the statutory regulation of 17 designated health and social care professions.  Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to persons granted registration.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council, HSCPC, with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU and are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  CORU is also charged with the promotion of high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants.  The Act provides for a transitional period of two years during which existing practitioners may register on the basis of specified qualifications.  Following this period, only registrants of a registration board, who are subject to the Act's regulatory regime, or those who applied during the transitional period and whose applications are still being determined or are under appeal are entitled to use the relevant protected title or titles.  <\/p> <p>From a public protection viewpoint, a crucial milestone in the regulation of the Act's designated professions was the introduction of the Act's fitness to practise regime in recent years.  This involved the commencement of Part 6 of the Act to allow for complaints about the conduct or competence of registrants to be investigated.  Where complaints are substantiated, disciplinary sanctions up to and including cancellation of registration may be imposed.  The regime is similar to that applicable to medical practitioners, nurses and midwives.   <\/p> <p>To date, 11 registration boards have been established in respect of 13 professions.  Eight registers are open and their respective professional titles are now fully protected under law following the close of the two-year transition period attaching to each register.  The registration boards for the professions of medical scientist, podiatrist, psychologist and social care worker, while established, have not yet opened their registers but are working hard to do so. <\/p> <p>I would also like to take the opportunity to update the House on the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists.  As Deputies may recall, these professions were not designated for regulation under the 2005 Act.  Following consultations with the HSCPC and a detailed public consultation on the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists, I decided last year to proceed with the designation of two distinct professions under the Act, that of counsellor and psychotherapist - each with its own register under one registration board.  I signed the regulations in April this year designating the new professions and establishing the Counsellors and Psychotherapist Registration Board following the approval of the regulations by both Houses.  This was followed with the advertising over the summer period by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, of a campaign to recruit 13 members for appointment to the registration board.  Following the conclusion of that process in September 2018, I intend to make the board appointments in the coming weeks.  Once appointed, the registration board will give consideration to a number of outstanding issues and will advise the council and the Department accordingly.  These include titles to be protected and the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners applying for registration in the transition period and for future graduates.  As the House will appreciate, and given that a number of other jurisdictions have tried and failed to regulate these professions, this is a challenging work programme that will take CORU time to achieve but I thank it for taking this work on.  It is important that we get this area right.  Counsellors and psychotherapists come across people who are often at the most vulnerable moments in their lives and it is important that when someone goes to see a counsellor or psychotherapist, they know who they are going to see and their qualifications.  This is a big body of work but one that is worth doing and getting right.  <\/p> <p>I am aware of other professions seeking designation under the Act.  Perhaps it is a sign of the times that we have gone from a system where people might not have wished to be regulated or fear regulation to one where nearly everybody comes forward and asks for their profession to be regulated.  Of course, there needs to be proportionality in this regard but professions such as creative arts therapists, play therapists, athletic rehabilitation therapists, chiropractors, audiologists and various scientific professions, to name but a few, have been making a case for regulation for some time.  The immediate priority, however, is to bring to conclusion the regulatory process for the 17 professions designated.  We must finish that body of work.  <\/p> <p>When all the registration boards have been established and their work programmes well under way, the Department will turn its attention to the question of how best to treat the unregulated professions.  A risk assessment, in terms of public protection, of the principal health and social care professions seeking designation will be undertaken in 2019 as a first step.  I very much welcome this.  It will inform decisions to be taken concerning options for their possible future regulation.  Department officials will work with CORU in progressing this project taking into account the ongoing and extremely demanding work programme being undertaken by the agency.   <\/p> <p>In addition, I am also obliged to take into consideration the recently adopted EU directive on a proportionality test before the adoption of new regulation of professions.  This directive establishes rules for member states to conduct proportionality assessments before the introduction of new, or the amendment of existing, professional regulations to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market while guaranteeing transparency and a high level of consumer protection.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Its intention is to harmonise the ways in which proportionality tests are carried out before member states introduce new regulations on professions and the criteria to be applied in accordance with European Court of Justice rulings.  It does not, however, affect the member states' competence to decide whether and how to regulate a profession within the limits of non-discrimination and proportionality.  This directive must be transposed by July 2020, following which member states which wish to adopt new regulatory procedures will be required to justify to the European Commission that such procedures are necessary and appropriate.  The Commission may take action if it deems such regulations to be insufficiently justified and, therefore, disproportionate, for example regarding their effect on free movement.<\/p><p>I propose to provide some background to the amendments contained within this Bill.  The Bill will amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to provide that all non-Irish professional qualifications which have been recognised by the Minister and by bodies acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration for a health and social care profession will continue to be recognised for the purposes of registration under this Act.  This will allow holders of such qualifications to be statutorily registered and to practise their profession.  As Senators are aware, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the introduction of a system of statutory regulation for 17 health and social care professionals.  When statutory regulation is introduced for a profession, a practitioner cannot practise in his or her professional capacity without being registered with the relevant registration board established under the Act, one of the requirements for which is that the applicant must hold an approved qualification.  <\/p><p>Section 38 provides that persons hold such a qualification if they hold an Irish qualification which has been approved by the relevant registration board, if they hold a European Economic Area, EEA, qualification which has been recognised under Directive 2005\/36\/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, if they have been practising the profession for not less than five years and hold certain Irish historical qualifications, or if they hold a professional qualification which the registration board decides attests to a standard of proficiency which corresponds to the approved relevant Irish qualification.<\/p><p>Section 38 as it stands, however, does not encompass non-EEA persons or persons with a non-EEA qualification who have previously had their qualifications recognised in Ireland on an administrative basis using processes that mirror those of Directive 2005\/36\/EC or its predecessors.  A serious difficulty, therefore, has arisen for these persons when they apply for registration.  While their qualifications may have been recognised in the past, the legislation as currently framed does not allow for their registration.  This gap in the legislation must be resolved to allow such persons register and practise their professions.  The Bill before us addresses this gap by providing in section 38 that the qualification of an applicant who has evidence that such qualification has been recognised by the Minister or by a body acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration for the relevant profession will be considered to be an approved qualification under the Act.  This means that there will be no requirement for reassessment of the qualification.   <\/p><p>The Bill has five sections.  Section 1 provides that the \"Principal Act\" referred to throughout is the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, while section 2 amends the definition of \"qualification\" in that Act.  Section 3 of the Bill amends the registration provisions of the Act to address the gap that currently exists in the legislation by providing that a member of a relevant designated profession who holds a relevant professional qualification which has been recognised by a relevant person is considered to hold an \"approved qualification\".  Section 4 provides for the insertion of a Schedule to the Bill which sets out the list of relevant designated professions and corresponding relevant persons.  Finally, section 5 provides for the Short Title of the Bill.<\/p><p>In conclusion, this matter is a priority as without these amendments each registration board at CORU is required to undertake a detailed assessment of the professional qualifications of certain health and social care professionals whose qualifications have previously been recognised by the State.  Such persons must submit an application to CORU and await a decision which can take a number of months as their formal training and post-qualification experience must be compared on a case-by-case basis against the current Irish reference standard.  This puts a consequential administrative burden on applicants and CORU.  As we know, CORU has enough to be doing and we would like it to focus on the areas we need it to focus on, rather than placing an additional and unnecessary burden on it or the applicants in this regard.  For these reasons I am keen that this Bill proceeds through the various Stages of this House and the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible in order that we can pass it into law and address what is a technical but important matter.  I commend the Bill to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#P02600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support this Bill, which makes minor technical amendments to the relevant Act and will facilitate any non-Irish health and social care professional qualification which was recognised in the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration with CORU in 2005.  Although a number of professions in 2005 had informal or voluntary systems of registration organised by their respective professional bodies, only five health professions were then subject to statutory registration in Ireland: doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians and pharmacists.<\/p> <p>The 2001 health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, gave a firm commitment to strengthen and expand provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Bill, therefore, represented an important step forward in strengthening the regulatory environment.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the introduction of a system of statutory regulation for certain health and social care professionals: clinical biochemists, counsellors and psychotherapists, dietitians, dispensing opticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, optometrists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, radiation therapists, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  This means that a practitioner cannot use the protected title, that is, he or she cannot practise in his or her professional capacity, without being registered with the relevant registration board.  Among other things this regulation protected vulnerable people from those who sought to prey on them with alternative therapies, which is important.<\/p> <p>One of the requirements for registration under the Act is that the applicant must hold an approved qualification and section 38 provides several routes for the recognition of qualifications.  This Bill adds a new route which provides that any non-Irish health professional qualification which was recognised either by the Minister or by bodies acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration for a health and social care profession, will be considered to be an approved qualification under the Act with no requirement for assessment by CORU.<\/p> <p>Section 3 is the key section of the Bill.  It proposes to amend section 38 of the 2005 Act.  A relevant professional qualification for the purpose of this section is defined as a professional qualification that has already been recognised by a relevant person as of a standard of proficiency which rendered the holder eligible for recruitment by the HSE in that profession.  Recognition must have been granted either before the establishment of the register for that designated profession, or on or after the establishment of the register where an assessment for recognition was commenced by the relevant person before that date.  The health and social care professions have been to the forefront in setting and maintaining standards of patient care and professionalism in this country.  They have been proactive in working towards a statutory system of registration and are supportive of the general principles underpinning the system.<\/p> <p>We are happy to support this Bill and we look forward to seeing it implemented in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#Q00300","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming the Minister to the House, and I acknowledge the dynamism and commitment he brings to his Ministry.  We are delighted to have him in the House yet again.<\/p> <p>My party is happy to commend the Bill also and to add to the unanimity around it.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 was of extraordinary importance.  It established statutory regulation which was crucial for the whole social care practitioner area.  Societal change, the needs and complexities of society, greater resources and a new environment have all created myriad new social care worker areas.  Therefore, regulation was and is crucial, and the 2005 legislation was seminal to that extent.  It established statutory legislation which ensures there is a minimum standard of education, proficiency and, insofar as it can be achieved, objective standardisation in these professions, which is to be welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend and welcome the amendment to the 2005 Act proposed by the Minister in the Bill to incorporate non-EEA personnel who have qualifications previously validated by the regulatory bodies in the host country, in this case, Ireland, whereby they will automatically gain registration and acceptance, as would be the case if they were from the EEA.  This is the objective of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Having commended and endorsed the Bill, and having recognised the serious importance of the 2005 Act in the first instance, I will make some general observations.  The Minister referenced the importance of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists.  As he said, people are in a very vulnerable state when they go to somebody like this.  They almost put themselves in a complete dependency situation.  It could be extraordinarily dangerous if we do not have the highest standards and regulations, proper qualifications and recognised monitoring and establishment of those occupations.  This is crucial.  As the Minister said, this all happens under CORU, the registration body for all 17 designated health and social care areas.  It is good that the range is wide and that nothing escapes this net.<br\/><br\/>This is a Second Stage debate, which allows a level of latitude, but my next point is pertinent.  I have discovered through meeting people and through general evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, that there is a huge problem with CORU's speed of processing.  I have come across instances of returning emigrants who, to continue in their profession, must establish that while they were abroad, they gained a certain amount of professional experience.  There is undue delay because, they are told, there must be a board meeting but surely a board could have designated officers who operate the established criteria of the board.  These would be proper professionals who understand the board's objectives and criteria and who could adjudicate on individual applicants with haste, without a lack of thoroughness but with haste.  Returning emigrants deserve this.<br\/><br\/>We are encouraging nurses, health professionals and social care professionals to return to Ireland and it is wonderful we are in this space.  The Minister has made a big effort to get many health professionals back working in this country.  If we invite them back should we leave them in limbo?  I could cite for the Minister privately later, as it would not be appropriate to do so publicly, instances of people sitting for months awaiting registration after returning home.  In one instance a particular high-quality professional is working in the bar business.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with working in the bar business <i>per se<\/i>but she is working in hospitality when in fact she is a qualified professional who has worked abroad.  She has been waiting for months for the registration process.  This is completely unacceptable.  The Minister is a very senior member of the Cabinet and this point needs to be made to him.  We encounter emigrants coming home from Australia, the US and England who are allegedly welcomed to Ireland, and we would all state there is a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte for them, but they are having nightmares with banking, insurance and driver licenses.  To be germane to what we are speaking about, they are having nightmares with delays in professional recognition.  These roadblocks to the talent and brains we are trying to attract back to our country should be removed.  It is a real issue.  I encounter it throughout the area and it needs addressing.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister to examine two particular issues with CORU.  These are whether it needs more staffing resources and the degree to which it could delegate within the organisation in order that it is not necessary to have cumbersome board meetings - that happen only at intervals of a few months - to register people .  This would mean that someone who appears with qualifications does not have to wait for the next board meeting.  I gather the next meeting is scheduled for November, which is appalling if it is true.  If it is not true I would be happy to be so informed by the Minister but I understand the next board meeting of CORU to process material will be in November.  What happens to a person who has come home and who has dependants, a mortgage and normal living expenses which, God knows, are high?  What must that person do in the intervening period?<br\/><br\/>As a professional myself, I cannot see how established professional people in CORU, who understand the objectives of the board, could not be delegated with the capacity to register people on a day-to-day basis.  There should not be a cumbersome bureaucratic procedure.  An issue of policy and accepting a particular qualification may arise in a broad sense but surely it could be executed efficiently on a day-to-day basis.  I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister on a real issue for the people whom I represent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#Q00500","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward the legislation, which is very welcome.  There is a need for regulation and I have come across it quite a bit in recent years.  Certain areas not covered by this are still not regulated and I acknowledge the Minister is also working on these areas.  It is important that we make sure everyone who provides a professional service has gone through a unified standard of training, whether it is for physiotherapy, speech and language therapy or social work, in order that we have a standard to be met before a person can hold him or herself out as being professionally qualified.<\/p> <p>I have come across an issue on a few occasions with regard to medical practitioners.  We must ensure those applying for jobs have not been barred from practising in the country from which they have come.  This is something that can easily fall through and it needs to be very carefully watched.  Recently, I came across the case of a medical practitioner who had obtained a job in a hospital and who had given information that was absolutely incorrect.  When it was corrected, the hospital acted immediately to remove the person from working on the wards and that person was suspended immediately.  Information had been supplied inaccurately and wrongly.  This is a huge area because people are going abroad to obtain qualifications and people are coming from other jurisdictions with qualifications.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator O'Reilly on the registration process.  I came across one case of someone who had set up in Ireland after practising in the UK for more than ten years, believing that a suitable qualification to carry on the practice here was held.  However, the person has been dealing with CORU for the past four to five months and has been requested to close down the facility, which is unfortunate.  We have come across problems where people set up practices and genuinely felt that they had fulfilled all of the criteria and had gone through the registration process but, for some reason, there was a misunderstanding about what had and had not been done.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is a challenge.  All those seeking registration must comply in full with the regulation and produce all of the necessary documentary evidence to show that they are qualified and can provide a service.<\/p><p>Although it is not covered by the Bill, the area of physical therapists is of concern.  It is being followed up on by the Department.  There is a concern regarding many physical therapists who are practising in Ireland but may not be allowed to continue their work in a particular area.  That issue must be addressed.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, of which I am a member, has written to the Department on the issue on a few occasions.  It is an issue of great concern which must be dealt with by the Department.<\/p><p>Another area not covered by the Bill and which needs to be monitored is that of people who provide scanning services.  Many companies offer scanning services without providing any additional support.  I previously gave the example of a pregnant woman going for a scan on a Saturday with a person operating privately and being advised that the foetus was not alive but no back-up support being immediately available for the woman.  That is an issue which causes me great concern.  It is important that anyone providing scanning services has professional indemnity insurance and so on.  Some GPs have difficulty getting such insurance.  If they wish to provide a scanning service, they must have adequate professional indemnity insurance.  That area must be addressed.  Aside from the issue of incorrect information being given, if there is no back-up support in a clinic, where can a person go to access such support, in particular at weekends?  It is an area that must be looked at.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It is extremely important that the regulations are properly implemented for all of the professions listed in the Bill and that structures are in place to ensure adequate supervision.  I thank the Minister and his officials for bringing forward the legislation and for the work that has been done by all involved, including those who agreed to sit on the boards.  It is very important that people are giving a commitment and are dedicated to ensuring that there is a standard which is maintained and improved on a constant basis.  I thank CORU for the work it is doing.  However, it is of great importance that the issues raised by Senator O'Reilly be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#R00200","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Swanick, O'Reilly and Colm Burke for their contributions and unanimity on the importance of what is a technical Bill that we need to pass as quickly as possible through both Houses of the Oireachtas in order that CORU can place its attention, effort and resources where we all want them to be.  We do not wish to cause delay to people who are perfectly well qualified to provide services here and whose qualifications have been recognised but who, under the existing Act, would again have to go through an individual assessment process.  I thank the Senators for their support in that regard.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator O'Reilly for raising several important issues and for his support regarding the need to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists.  This is a big area.  As I stated in my opening remarks, other jurisdictions have tried and failed to implement such regulation.  I am determined that we will succeed and get this right.  In the course of discussions of women's healthcare I have been horrified by some of the advice which I was told had been given to women, often pregnant women or women in crisis, by people who call themselves counsellors or psychotherapists.  If one examines the qualifications or lack thereof of such individuals, one would not want them to treat one's loved ones.  It is very important to regulate in this area out of respect for the qualifications of the many brilliant and qualified people who work in it and in order to control the rogue elements which often enter it.<\/p> <p>On CORU, its busyness and the potential for delays, I thank Senator O'Reilly for highlighting this important issue which he encountered through interaction with people in his constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  Applications for recognition of non-Irish health and social care professional qualifications are assessed in accordance with the European directive which I outlined.  It provides for a detailed assessment on a case-by-case basis of an applicant's formal training and post-qualification professional experience and how those compare with the qualifications required to practise here.  The competent authority must issue a decision to an applicant within four months of the submission of a complete application.  Of course, the Senator is correct that due to the improved economic climate and the fact that we are increasing the number of professional registers, far more people are now applying for recognition.  In fact, the volume of applicants seeking registration has more than doubled since 2015.<\/p> <p>The Senator is entirely correct that more people are coming to Ireland, want to work here and want their qualifications to be recognised.  In response, CORU has allocated additional resources, including additional staff, to ensure that the four-month timeline stipulated in the directive is met.  Although CORU endeavours to process applications as quickly as possible, its overarching objective, as the Senator will agree, must be to ensure patient safety and that the required criteria are applied rigorously.  I have some good news in that regard because I have been advised by CORU that an online application system which will greatly assist applicants and CORU in terms of processing applications will be operational in the coming months and should lead to an improvement in the situation.  Documentation accompanying an application is often incomplete, which adds to the back and forth between the applicant and CORU.  Ensuring that complete applications are submitted and then dealt with in a chronological and fair order is how CORU must proceed.  I will keep a very close eye on its resourcing and staffing but the new online application system will be of assistance to applicants and CORU and I hope it will result in an improvement in some of the issues highlighted by Senator O'Reilly.<\/p> <p>The Senator also asked me to consider the issue of delegation.  While I understand his point, the situation is quite complex in the context of the 2005 Act, under which it is clear that the board makes the decision.  However, I will consider the broader point he raises.<\/p> <p>The whole-of-government point made by the Senator in regard to returning emigrants is very important.  The Government has discussed the issue on several occasions.  Thankfully, we are back in an era of net immigration into our country.  All Members want the return of Irish people who had to leave the country because they could not get a job or did not see a future here.  Thankfully, as we approach full employment, people are coming back to our country.  The Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs, Deputy Cannon, is very eager to ensure their return is as smooth as possible and I will pass on the Senator's comments in that regard to him.  It is an issue in which the Taoiseach has taken a personal interest.<\/p> <p>I will write to Senator Colm Burke regarding the issue of physical therapists and the correspondence I received from the Joint Committee on Health in that regard.  I will pass on his important remarks regarding scanning to the HSE and, in particular, the national women and infants health programme.  It is important that a full range of services and supports are provided along with the results of a scan.  It is sometimes traumatic and very difficult for people to receive certain scan results.<\/p> <p>I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#S00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539768600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":337,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#S00400","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#S00500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The greyhound racing sector contributes a substantial number of jobs to the economy, estimated at 5,000 people as recently as 2017 by Mr. Jim Power, economic consultant.  The sector also contributes &euro;300 million annually into local economies.  In addition, it is estimated that there are approximately 7,000 greyhound owners, with an estimated 12,000 people deriving an economic benefit from the sector.  It is further estimated that more than 14 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings in Ireland since 2002.<\/p> <p>Bord na gCon is a commercial State body.  It was established under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.  It is responsible for the regulation, control, promotion and operation of greyhound racing.  The activities of Bord na gCon include the licensing of greyhound tracks and their officials, the authorisation of bookmakers to conduct business at tracks, the operation of totalisator betting at greyhound tracks, the regulation of public sales of greyhounds, the making of grants for prize money, the allocation of grants to improve amenities at tracks, and the collection of levies from on-course betting.  Bord na gCon licenses a total of 16 greyhound tracks and owns and operates a number itself.  These are Shelbourne Park, Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Youghal, Limerick and Galway.  It also has a 51% share in the Mullingar track.<\/p> <p>Bord na gCon receives direct subvention from the State, through the horse and greyhound fund, to assist with the development of the sector.  Funding for the greyhound industry declined significantly during the economic downturn from a high of &euro;15.3 million in 2008 to a low of &euro;10.8 million in 2014.  Since 2014, funding has been restored to pre-recession levels through a series of annual increases.  In 2017, the industry received &euro;16 million and this accounted for approximately 39% of its total income.  In 2019, it will receive a modest increase of &euro;800,000, bringing the total Exchequer contribution for the year to &euro;16.8 million.<\/p> <p>As I am sure Senators are aware, until recently Bord na gCon was servicing a substantial burden of debt which has acted as a financial straitjacket on the industry.  The sale of Harold's Cross greyhound racing track has lifted that burden.  The surplus of approximately &euro;6 million from the sale will allow Bord na gCon, as set out in its strategic plan for 2018-2022, to make further welfare enhancements and improve basic facilities at its tracks.  That will be to the benefit of all those who participate in and enjoy the sport.<\/p> <p>Before dealing with the substance of the Bill, I would like to refer to the Indecon report, Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon, which was commissioned in 2014 by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  A wide-ranging stakeholder consultation process was undertaken by Indecon consultants in 2014.  As part of the review, advertisements were placed on the Department's website and in the farming and sporting press seeking submissions from interested parties.  A total of 17 submissions were received from a broad range of respondents.<\/p> <p>That report made a number of recommendations on governance, regulation and financial matters.  The Minister, following publication of the Indecon report, invited and received feedback on the report.  The Department also consulted directly with Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, the Bord na gCon stakeholder forum and with various representatives on the issues.  This report has broadly been accepted as a roadmap for the development of the sector.  A number of recommendations in the report required legislative change and these recommendations are being addressed in this Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Recommendations were also made in a 2016 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and in a 2015 Bord na gCon-commissioned report on anti-doping and medication commonly known as the Morris report.  Elements of these reports have also been taken into account in drafting the Bill.<\/p><p>The general scheme was subject to very thorough pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2017.  I believe the committee heard from all the major players in the industry and departmental officials also appeared before it.  The appropriate observations of the joint committee, identified as part of the pre-legislative process, were incorporated into the general scheme on 15 May, which was then approved by Government for drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I will be happy to detail the changes on Committee Stage but in the meantime, I acknowledge and thank members of the committee for their useful input into the development of this Bill.<\/p><p>In addition, during the course of drafting a number of changes were made to the Bill on the advice of the office of the parliamentary draftsman.  One such change places a greater emphasis on fair procedures, particularly with regard to the conduct of investigations by the board in respect of possible breaches of racing regulations and with regard to the conduct of hearings by the control committee into suspected breaches.  Another requires Bord na gCon to consult with stakeholders and the Minister prior to making regulations.  Additionally, where regulation breaches lead to criminal offences, the consent of the Minister is required to those regulations.  Finally the ability to make regulation under \"incidental, ancillary and miscellaneous\" provisions has been removed.<\/p><p>There also has been a modernisation of the provisions relating to the borrowings of Bord na gCon, where explicit reference is now made to a requirement for the consent of the Minister for Finance, in addition to that of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before all borrowings can be undertaken.<\/p><p>Before going through the Bill in detail, I would like to draw to the attention of the House a number of changes in the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which were not in the general scheme.  The programme for partnership Government states that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 will be strengthened and enforced.  The opportunity is being taken, in fulfilment of this commitment, to revise elements of the Act on the basis of legal advice, experience gained in operating the legislation and to remove some minor errors of a typographical nature.<\/p><p>Returning to matters relating to greyhound racing, in broad terms the Bill addresses issues relating to governance and regulation in the greyhound racing sector.  It addresses governance issues in Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions, improves integrity, includes the welfare of greyhounds as one of the statutory functions of Bord na gCon and provides it with powers to make regulations in relation to integrity, anti-doping, administration and traceability to improve welfare and integrity deficits impacting the industry.<\/p><p>I will now provide Senators with details of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement of the Bill.<\/p><p>Section 2 provides the definitions for the Bill.  Significantly it inserts definitions for \"Racing code&rdquo;, \"Sanction breach\" and &ldquo;Racing sanction\".  These definitions provide a basis for administrative sanctions for breaching the rules of greyhound racing in addition to the current criminal sanctions.  It also inserts a definition for a substance, a veterinary practitioner, the control committee and the scientific advisory committee and includes a definition for disqualification and exclusion orders as racing sanctions.<\/p><p>Section 3 amends the definition of \"the Board\" and \"the Minister\" in the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.<\/p><p>Section 4 updates the provisions for service of documents and provides that emails may be used to serve documents.<\/p><p>Section 5 is a general regulation making provision and sets out the procedures to be followed by the board, including consultation with interested parties, when the board proposes to make new regulations under this Act.<\/p><p>Section 6 allows for summary prosecution by the board.<\/p><p>Section 7 provides that existing regulations will be revoked on enactment of the measures in the Bill.  Provisions similar to those in the statutory instruments are being brought into primary legislation.  However section 7(2) allows matters before the regulatory committees to continue as though the regulations have not been revoked for the smooth administration of justice.  If this provision is not inserted, cases before the committees may have to be reheard by the statutory committees under this Act.  Any appeal from a decision of the control committee provided for in subsection (2) shall be appealed to the appeal committee.<\/p><p>Sections 8 provides for a change of name for Bord na gCon to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>Sections 9 and 10 are on foot of recommendations in the Indecon report and relate to the governance of Bord na gCon.  They are as follows: an increase in the number of members of the board from a chairperson and six members to a chairperson and eight members, and an increase in the quorum of the board from four to six; a term of office of five years for the chairperson, as opposed to the current indeterminate period; a statutory prohibition on the re-appointment of a person to the board beyond two consecutive terms, to reflect the code of practice for the governance of State bodies; statutory powers permitting the Minister to remove a board member where the member falls ill and is unable to perform his or her duties or breaches the code of practice for the governance of State bodies as published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; cessation of appointment to the board in a number of circumstances, including if a board member is adjudicated bankrupt, is found guilty of offences relating to the greyhound industry, welfare of animals, intimidation or assault, fraud or dishonesty.  <\/p><p>Section 11 provides for the current standard provisions in relation to elected representatives participation on State boards.  This provision is standard in modern law.  <\/p><p>Section 12 provides for disclosure of potential conflicts of interests.  This is a new provision and was recommended in the Indecon report.<\/p><p>Section 13 sets out for the first time by statute, an overarching statement outlining the functions of the board.  It is intended to provide additional legal certainty in relation to the functions of the board.<\/p><p>Section 14 provides that the board is statutorily subject to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>Section 15 allows the board of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to delegate its functions to the CEO as the board considers necessary for efficiency and effectiveness reasons.<\/p><p>Section 16 inserts an explicit provision permitting the board to apply funds to enhance greyhound health and welfare.<\/p><p>Section 17 modernises the wording regarding the ability of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to borrow, but retains the requirement for the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, acting with the consent of the Minister for Finance. <\/p><p>Section 17 of the principal Act is therefore repealed.<\/p><p>Section 18 explicitly provides for the reporting of the accounts of subsidiaries of the board.<\/p><p>Section 19 increases the maximum fine to &euro;250,000 on indictment for operating a greyhound racing track without a licence.  This brings the 1958 Act into line with current sanction regimes.<\/p><p>Sections 20 to 22, inclusive, of this Bill replace section 25 of the principal Act.  Section 20 provides for the making of regulations in relation to race tracks and provides for a sanction of a class A fine.  It provides for regulations prohibiting racing officials operating unless they have permits and prohibiting individuals from having beneficial interests in aspects of the business.  Section 21 extends the regulatory powers of the board to control racing officials and ensuring the integrity of the sport.  Section 21(1) deals with the control of racing while section 21(2) deals with the conduct of racing and the promotion of integrity and fair play in racing, including the use of information technology to assist towards this end.  Section 21(3) deals with the administration of racing, including the registration and grading of greyhounds and the promotion of racing, section 21(4) deals with charges for entry of a greyhound to a race and section 21(5) states that breaches of regulations provided for in this section carry racing sanctions.  Section 22 allows the board to make guidelines to control the establishment, lay-out, construction and maintenance of greyhound race tracks or the use of equipment at such tracks.  Enforcement of guidelines in this area will be through the track licensing regime.<\/p><p>Section 23 repeals section 25 of the principal Act.<\/p><p>Sections 24 to 26, inclusive, are a recasting of the provisions in sections 37 to 39, inclusive, of the principal Act in relation to the training of greyhounds for reward, the public sale of greyhounds and the artificial insemination of greyhounds.  The corresponding sections or subsections or both in the principal Act are repealed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The consent of the Minister is now required for any new regulations made under these sections.  It continues to be an offence to engage in these activities without a licence, permit or approval issued by the board.  However, the contravention of regulations made under these sections by a licensee, permit holder or approval holder now carries racing sanction.<br\/><br\/>Section 27 details the regulation making powers of the board in the area of doping control and the administration of substances to a greyhound.  Among other things, it allows the board to list substances that may or may not be given to a greyhound, setting residue limits, withdrawal periods, declaring thresholds and the methodologies by which thresholds can be determined for substances.  The board may make regulations requiring the keeping of records regarding the administration of substances, the controls to be operated and records to be kept by persons participating in greyhound racing in relation to doping and medication control.  The advice and recommendations of the scientific advisory committee are to be used to determine the processes, methods, levels of accuracy, etc., by which samples are deemed to contain a substance.  It also provides that a greyhound that fails a test for a prohibited substance is disqualified from racing or trialling until it passes a subsequent test.<br\/><br\/>Section 28 relates to regulatory powers for the traceability of greyhounds.  The board may make regulations to require the registration of greyhound owners, the registration of racing greyhounds and the notification by owners, breeders and trainers of greyhounds of many more life events than those currently captured on existing stud book and microchipping databases.  These regulations will support the board in its ambition to establish and maintain a new comprehensive tracing database for racing greyhounds.<br\/><br\/>Section 29 allows the board to make regulations for the health and welfare of a greyhound, including requiring those involved to provide information for the sound administration of the industry and to protect the health and welfare of greyhounds.  It also allows the board to set down provisions for the treatment of diseased and injured greyhounds and the establishment of funds to protect the health and welfare of a greyhound.<br\/><br\/>Sections 30 to 34, inclusive, relate to the board's right to grant or refuse licences, to attach conditions to licences, permits and approvals, make charges for the grant and renewal of licences, etc., and to revoke or suspend such licences.  The fair procedures to be followed, including the right to reply where the board refuses, revokes or suspends a licence, etc., is provided for.<br\/><br\/>Sections 35 to 37, inclusive, and 40 relate to the appointment, investigatory powers and functions of the authorised officers.  This is the first time the appointment of authorised officers for the purposes of greyhound legislation has been provided for in primary legislation.  It provides amplified powers for authorised officers to investigate matters, including investigating the use of performance altering substances.  Section 40 specifically provides that, subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court, authorised officers may seek a search warrant, including to search a domestic dwelling, where the authorised officer believes there may be evidence of a breach or an intended breach of the racing code or of the commission or intended commission of an offence under the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993.<br\/><br\/>Sections 38, 39 and 41 relate to the obligation of persons to provide assistance to and follow the directions of authorised officers when carrying out their functions under the Act, including a requirement to produce a greyhound at a specific time and place.  In addition, it is being made a criminal offence to obstruct, fail to give information, to give false information or to fail to provide assistance or follow the direction of an authorised officer when carrying out his or her functions.  The standard provisions regarding self-incrimination are provided for.<br\/><br\/>Section 42 sets out the procedures for the conduct of investigations by the board and permits the board to notify the club where there is a possibility that matters known to it may be of concern to the club.  Section 43 sets down the classes of people who are subject to the jurisdiction of the control and appeal committees.  It also states that the determination of racing sanctions rests with these committees.<br\/><br\/>Section 44 provides for the establishment by statute of the control committee and details its operations.  The control committee will consist of a chairperson and a maximum of eight other members to ensure there is a sufficient pool of members to deal promptly with control matters.  The control committee will require a quorum of the chairperson, or deputy chairperson, and two other members.  Appointments to the committee are made by the Minister for a maximum of two terms.  The chair has a term of five years with ordinary member having a term of four years.<br\/><br\/>Section 45 provides for fair procedures in relation to hearings of the control committee.  It specifically provides that decisions may be made <i>in absentia<\/i>in respect of persons who fail to attend the control committee.  Section 46 sets out the details of the racing sanctions which may be applied by the control committee and appeal committee.  Racing sanctions may be advice, admonishment or censure, the disqualification of greyhounds, or the exclusion of individuals from racing activities or the revocation or suspension of licences or permits.  In addition, a person may be required to pay a sum not exceeding &euro;12,500 to the board in certain circumstances, including where the person has an adverse analytical finding for a prohibited or controlled substance.  It provides that a person who fails to make a payment shall not be permitted to train, transfer ownership of, race greyhounds or attend a greyhound race track until the amount is paid in full.  It also provides for the publication of the names of those who have failed to pay a sanction payment.<br\/><br\/>Section 47 relates to disqualification orders.  At present, the board may issue a disqualification order in respect of a greyhound for breach of the racing code.  Such disqualification orders apply to racing and trials only.  Some individuals have circumvented these orders by transferring ownership.  This section provides that disqualification orders issued by the control committee or the appeal committee are racing sanctions and disqualify greyhounds from racing and trials and circumvention of the order is prevented by extending the potential restriction to transferring ownership of the greyhound and use of the greyhound for breeding purposes.  The disqualification order can be for a specific period and the terms and conditions for revocation or variation of the order will be specified at the time of making the order.<br\/><br\/>Section 48 provides for the exclusion of individuals from certain activities relating to racing greyhounds.  This power currently rests with the board or the club.  However, under this Bill, power to issue an exclusion order is limited to the control committee and the appeal committee.  In addition, it is now possible to specify a time period for which the order applies and the terms and conditions for revocation or variation of the order will be specified at the time of making.  Non-compliance with an exclusion order is a criminal offence.  The club will issue its own orders under its rules.  This section also provides explicitly that the committee is independent in the exercise of its functions and requires the committee to publish its decisions.<br\/><br\/>Section 49 sets down the procedures for appeals in respect of racing sanctions or payments imposed by the control committee.  Section 50 provides for a single avenue of appeal for decisions in relation to sanctions and payments imposed by the control committee following the abolition of the current control appeal committee established under article 10 of the Greyhound Industry (Control Committee and Control Appeal Committee) Regulations 2007, which is SI 301 of 2007.  The appeal committee retains its function in respect of appeals under section 51 of the principal Act from decisions of the board.  In the interests of good governance it imposes a maximum of two terms on committee members.  It also provides that the board will pay the remuneration and expenses of appeal committee members and will provide secretarial services to the committee.<br\/><br\/>Section 51 provides the procedures for appeals in respect of sanctions or payments imposed by the control committee and is a recasting of existing provisions in section 51 of the principal Act.  Section 52 provides for the communication of decisions of the control committee and the appeal committee to the individual concerned.  This section also provides for the staying of sanctions and payments while the situation is under appeal.  An exception applies to decisions in relation to adverse analytical findings where sanctions are effective immediately.<br\/><br\/>Section 53 provides for appeals to the District Court for findings of the appeal committee in relation to exclusion orders and-or sanction payments.  Appeals in relation to sanction payments are limited to the quantum of the sum.  It also provides that the District Court may grant a stay on the application of the relevant determination of the appeal committee.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Section 54 relates to evidential certificates issued by testing laboratories in the case of adverse analytical findings.  Section 55 provides for the updating of fines generally, the modernisation of wording and the deleting of sections of the principal Act that are no longer relevant.<\/p><p>Section 56 is intended to provide legal certainty in regard to the eligibility of greyhounds registered in the stud book.  Section 57 makes it a criminal offence for a person who is intoxicated or aggressive to refuse to leave a track or sale when required to do so.  Section 58 allows for the transfer of information between different entities for the purposes of those Acts relating to greyhounds.<\/p><p>Section 59 relates to the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and provides that only progeny produced in compliance with subsections (2) and (3) of section 11 of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 &mdash; that is, the first litter to the sixth or the seventh litter and eighth following certification &mdash; are permitted to be registered in the Irish greyhound stud book and makes it an offence for a person to attempt to register litters not in compliance with the Act.<\/p><p>Section 60 provides a definition specific to Part 11.  Section 61 makes technical amendments in regard to offences under section 36 of the Act and is to be read in conjunction with section 63.  Section 62 is a technical amendment that clarifies the penalty applicable for the breach of an obligation under an EU regulation.  Section 63 provides for making and recovering charges for the costs associated with the detention of seized animals.  Section 64 provides explicitly for record-keeping requirements and the making of returns to facilitate monitoring compliance with animal health and welfare notices.<\/p><p>Amendments to section 65 are to be made, on legal advice, to remove doubt as to the extent to which the Minister may make regulations in regard to EU matters, databases, animal traceability and transport.  Section 66 provides for a range of minor amendments to the Act either of a typographical nature or that could be better clarified, and they are proposed on the basis of experience in applying the Act since it came into operation.<\/p><p>This legislation will improve the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions, improve integrity in the sport through new anti-doping provisions and improve the welfare of the greyhound through the traceability measures being introduced and the increased powers being provided to the authorised officers of the board.  All of this is with a view to building a reputation for excellence in the sector.  The Bill will strengthen the Irish greyhound racing industry, enabling it to deal with the existing challenges it faces and help to maximise its potential.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#CC00700","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.

It was really appreciated.  I do not intend to go through the Bill in such detail step by step today.  That would be more appropriate to further Stages.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill and its passage to the next Stage.<\/p> <p>The Bill, as the Minister of State said, seeks to improve governance of Bord na gCon.  It strengthens the regulatory framework and controls in the racing industry.  It also updates sanctions and improves integrity in the sector, including in respect of greyhound welfare, as a statutory function of Bord na gCon, which will soon be known as R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, while empowering the authority to make regulations with respect to integrity, traceability, anti-doping and administration.  Unfortunately, this is another example of the Government's sluggish legislative delivery.  It has dragged its feet in implementing the recommendations in the 2016 all-party joint committee on the Irish greyhound industry, the 2014 Indecon report on the sector and the 2016 Morris review of anti-doping and medication in Ireland, commissioned by Bord na gCon itself.  All these reports have exposed deficiencies in the governance of the greyhound industry, industry standards and greyhound welfare.  The proposals in the reports are pivotal to securing the future of the industry and strengthening governance, administrative and animal welfare structures.<\/p> <p>Promoting public confidence in the sport, industry and business was important.  It is a game that is often portrayed in a bad light, as is most evident from the highlighting of illegal and horrific training regimes that were in practice in Australia.  By virtue of the fact that we were waiting for this Bill, it left our industry somewhat vulnerable and open to an onslaught from by the general public.  I hope this Bill will help to enhance the image of greyhound racing.  The Government should have exhibited greater urgency in trying to pass this legislation swiftly.<\/p> <p>Greyhound racing employs in the region of over 5,000 people and contributes an estimated &euro;300 million annually in economic output to local economies around tracks over a wide geographical spread.  Since 2002, over 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.  As the Minister of State said, the majority of the 18 tracks are in rural areas.  Most training yards and most greyhound owners are rurally based.  The associated financial input is vital to the rural communities concerned.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to developing the greyhound industry as a quality Irish industry through good regulation and maintaining premier animal welfare standards and enforcement.  It is vital, in ensuring the integrity of the industry, to make sure the highest standards permeated all levels.  We do not condone any cruelty to any animals, including greyhounds.  I encourage anyone who is aware of cruelty to report it immediately to the relevant authorities.<\/p> <p>This Bill relates to the welfare of greyhounds, including the use of funds to enhance the welfare of greyhounds and improved investigatory powers in regard to greyhound welfare.  Animal welfare groups inputted their policy proposals at the pre-legislative stage of the Bill before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am a member.  Great credit is due to the committee because this Bill was examined very thoroughly.  All those who deserved or needed to have an input were invited to meetings of the committee, and all their recommendations were taken very much on board.<\/p> <p>Representatives stated additional funds were needed to look after dogs when they stop racing.  The State must ensure sufficient funding is made available to cater for this.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the annual horse and greyhound racing fund proposals laid before the Houses, as provided for under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  This Act paved the way for substantial changes in both structures and funding for this key national asset.  As stated, &euro;80 million was allocated in 2018 to the horse and greyhound racing fund, with 80% going to Horse Racing Ireland.  Basically, this amounted to &euro;64 million, while 20%, amounting to &euro;16 million, went to Bord na gCon.  I welcome the fact that, under budget 2019, it is proposed to increase the funding by &euro;800,000 to &euro;16.8 million.  I hope that, following the sale of the stadium at Harold's Cross, and now that Bord na gCon is in a position to write off its long-standing debts, there will be more financial resources available within the industry to invest in the smaller rural tracks and to put towards the implementation of many measures in the Bill.  I look forward to the Bill progressing through the Houses and to its imminent implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018101700002#FF00300","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.
