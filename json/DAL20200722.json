We have seen the pandemic have a significant impact upon society, but as legislators we need to recognise that our response to it must be based upon accurate, factual information.  If people are looking for accurate, factual information on the pandemic, I recommend they go to the State's Covid-19 data hub, which is available on the Ordnance Survey website, as it provides very detailed, factual, empirical information in respect of the pandemic and its impact on the country.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I wish to set out some of the relevant factual statistics in respect to the pandemic as I think they must guide all of our decisions as policymakers when it comes to legislation or policy decisions.  Since the pandemic arrived on these shores some five months ago, 25,802 people have been detected as having the Covid-19 virus.  Of those 25,802 people, 1,753 people have died of or with Covid-19.  That is a tragedy for all of those families.  However, it may be the case that the number of deaths is too high because we know that when we look at the information about excess deaths in Ireland in the past five months it seems to suggest there is an excess death rate of approximately 1,200.  Whether the figure is 1,753 or 1,200, a large number of people, unfortunately, have died as a result of this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to bring ourselves back to March and recall why we decided we were going to introduce such a stringent lockdown.  The reason for it was that we saw what was happening in the intensive care units in Italy and Spain and in the hospitals of Italy and Spain, and we were legitimately concerned that when the pandemic came to Ireland we could find our intensive care units overwhelmed with people coming in with Covid-19 and we would be unable to provide them with the appropriate medical attention.  That was an appalling prospect for any country to face, and it was for that reason we made the correct decision to go into the lockdown.<\/p>  <p>  We need to record, however, and remember how many people have gone into intensive care units as a result of Covid-19.  To date, over the past five months, 437 people have been admitted to intensive care units with Covid-19.  That reached a heightened level of concern in April.  On 11 April there were approximately 155 people in intensive care units in Ireland, which was a matter of real concern to us.  What we need to be aware of, however, is that today, 22 July, we are in the fortunate position that only seven people in Ireland are in intensive care units with Covid-19.  That is a very manageable figure, although it is obviously a very difficult time for those seven people, but it is a considerable reduction on where we were on 11 April.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to assess where we are in terms of hospitalisation, because obviously a much greater number of people went into hospital with Covid-19 than went into intensive care units.  To date, some 3,343 people in Ireland have been hospitalised with the Covid-19 virus.  However, today, 22 July, we are in the fortunate position that only 13 people are in hospital with Covid-19.  We have come from a situation where we had significant numbers of people in intensive care units in hospital to a situation where there are only seven people in intensive care units and 13 people in hospital with Covid-19.  I wish all of them a speedy recovery.  I know it is a very difficult time for them and their families, but it is important to state that if we can retain figures at that level, there will be no reason for us to consider having to go back into lockdown.  I know people are concerned about the increasing number of cases that are being reported on a daily basis, but we need to be careful we do not become unnecessarily unnerved by those figures.  It was always going to be the case that the figures were going to rise as a result of the loosening of the significant restrictions that we put in back in March.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at the economic consequences and facts in respect to this matter.  As I stated last week, unemployment is now 22.5% and youth unemployment is 45%.  We need to ensure we have measures in place to deal with that.  That is the reason I am supportive of this legislation, which I believe will be very helpful to small businesses in providing them with credit to ensure they can get their business operations up and running again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200003#A00300","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1595406600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has outlined the stark numbers that have presented with Covid-19.  We have faced an extreme challenge.  It is appropriate to note that in fact has been the case throughout our history.  I refer to famine, invasion, occupation and economic struggle.  That hardship is recognised.  I expect the Covid-19 pandemic will, unfortunately, cause a very significant economic difficulty for this nation.  The challenge we face is of a different type than we are used to throughout our history.  The challenge of tackling Covid-19 will require the State to act in ways it has never acted before.  We have risen to the challenges of this situation, both in terms of the response of individual citizens and the State's response by means of public sector workers, from hospital porters and doctors and nurses, up to and including Members of the Oireachtas who passed emergency legislation some months ago for the purposes of ensuring that citizens were supported through this process during the lockdown.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it does appear the struggle will continue for some time.  The economic fallout from the virus will likely long outlast the impacts of the virus itself.  As we are all acutely aware, Ireland's business community has been hit hard in recent months and this scene has been replicated across the world.  The global economy now faces the challenge of a generation.  The spectre of a second wave of the virus in the autumn and winter has sown scepticism and caution within the business community and international markets.  It is in this light we can recognise the need for clear and effective domestic legislation to support businesses and people through this economically turbulent time.  Thousands of families across Ireland woke up this morning filled with worry, as their livelihoods have been severely curtailed in recent months.  We will have to wait, and still may never know, the full extent that this period has had on the mental health and well-being of so many people in our country.  For most, the sacrifice of jobs and livelihoods were made with grace, dignity and understanding, understanding that these sacrifices were made to protect the lives of the vulnerable in our community and to protect people they may never meet.  Together, we flattened the curve and are doing our best to keep the situation under control.  However, as society and the economy have begun to reopen, the risks to the future financial viability of many businesses in Ireland are becoming exposed and pose a real threat to our long-term economic health.<\/p> <p>Small and medium enterprises, SMEs, play one of the most significant roles in the economy, employing approximately 1 million people prior to the pandemic, driving new innovation and advancing our contribution to every field of endeavour.  Their impact on the success of this country cannot be overstated.  I am, therefore, pleased that since the earliest phases of the pandemic, supports for SMEs have been made available and continue to be adapted to reflect the economic reality of this crisis.  This Bill will result in the implementation and development of the largest credit guarantee in the history of the State, accurately reflecting the magnitude of the issues in front of us.  Such measures, along with important amendments to company law legislation and the grant schemes available, will provide SMEs with a stable environment in which they can navigate their way through this crisis.<\/p> <p> The availability of, and access to, stable lines of credit may prove to be a significant factor in the survival of countless businesses, reaching into every sector of our economy and touching every village in Ireland.  While it may not be possible to protect every business and job, we can limit our exposure to the worst ramifications of the global economic downturn.  By acting now and implementing the necessary changes to give SMEs breathing space, we can weather this storm and emerge from the crisis in a position of stability that will allow us to regain our growth and take advantage of new opportunities.<\/p> <p> For many years, Ireland has been an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, FDI.  This source of revenue and jobs has undoubtedly contributed to the transformation of our economy and our island.  However, in a global environment of uncertainty, we must give pause to consider, rightly, the long-term health of the economy.  We have a strong foundation of SMEs and this, combined with an attractive and open system that supports new companies being launched and expanded in Ireland, can secure continued growth into the future.<\/p> <p> The Covid-19 pandemic has demanded changes within our society and not all of these changes can or will be reversed.  The nature of work, long debated over recent years, has been shown to be more adaptable than we might have ordinarily thought.  Working from home and improved work-life balance have been shown to be possible and to be a viable arrangement for many businesses.  Helping SMEs adapt to these and other changes help the whole of society and can ease certain costs SMEs and employees endure.<\/p> <p> Developing a flexible and innovative economy and business environment can provide Ireland with a competitive edge over other nations when we, as an international community, overcome the impacts of Covid.  Creating innovation hubs, increasing programmes to enhance the financial education of SME owners, drafting effective national SME policies and action plans, as well as supporting a significant increase in the digitalisation that SMEs have clearly shown appetite for in recent months, based on applications for the trading online voucher scheme, will deliver real change to our SME sector.  I believe that a renewed approach towards SMEs can benefit all of society, helping, in effect, to stabilise the present but plan for the future and better days.<\/p> <p> Ireland has the potential to make significant gains in the years ahead.  No longer bound by geographic or industrial might, Ireland finds itself competing in a global economy, driven by progress in innovation, the digital economy, medical advancements and environmentally friendly technology.  These sectors will see an ever-increasing number of jobs and revenue streams in the decades ahead.  Through a young and educated workforce, we have the ability to provide the right environment for businesses and start-ups to release the full potential of our people, helping to drive a new era of financial and economic success.  None of this will be easily gained, nor will it be possible to achieve in the absence of a vibrant and healthy SME sector.  Diversifying our approach and ensuring SMEs and entrepreneurs have the supports they need to thrive will be to the long-term benefit of everyone, lifting our society to new heights and emerging from this time of struggle with a positive story to tell future generations.<\/p> <p> As was mentioned by Deputy O'Callaghan, the unemployment rate is at 22%.  It was a lot higher.  Hundreds of thousands of people in the State are still being supported through the wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Those decisions were made by Members to the betterment and improvement of society as a whole.<\/p> <p> The decisions the House will make in the coming weeks and months will shape the economic future of the country for years to come.  It is imperative that we send a message to existing SMEs and young entrepreneurs that the Government and the House supports them on every step of their companies' journey from their beginning, through an approachable system that fosters company growth, to ongoing support through business development grants and to credit support should those businesses experience difficult times.  Providing certainty to our business community will result in Ireland having a better future.<\/p> <p> Some of the difficulties with the previous scheme are well known to the business community.  Given the changes made in 2012, certain aspects of the scheme have been a little bit slow to be taken up by the business community.  I have long believed a business-led simplification of the credit guarantee schemes available through the State should be made.  While I accept, of course, that our financial institutions must bear some of the risk of State-backed supports to the SME sector, I wonder whether there are lessons we can learn from recent years, in respect of the success rate of individual companies drawing down the credit guarantee schemes available, to ensure this enhanced scheme with a &euro;2 billion limit does what Members want it to do.  This is something worthy of consideration.<\/p> <p> We must consider a number of aspects of the Bill and associated legislation, particularly as September approaches.  One of the discussions that took place last night with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on a motion tabled by the Sinn F&eacute;in party was on supports for the childcare sector.  This is a prime example of parents who might want to go back to work and who will avail of their children returning to school for the first time in six months when they start in September.  If a child is unable to attend school because of a cold, a respiratory short-term illness or a sniffle, and is not allowed into the classroom because of certain arrangements, what of the parent trying to run a small business or who is an employee in a small business?  What protection will these individuals have in the context of their employment rights?  Should they have to take additional time off?  Many parents throughout the island have run out of annual leave.  There are associated considerations to be made by all of us in the House.  While I am certain the Bill will pass, I am not certain we have the time left in the D&aacute;il schedule to consider all aspects and implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on employment rights and the various supports that have to be provided across the board throughout all sectors.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill.  I have long been an advocate of altering the system we have in place for the purposes of making it easier for businesses to draw down on it.  However, I recognise that certain financial institutions will review an application to the credit guarantee scheme or other State support scheme and apply what I believe to be difficult criteria, which involve companies being refused even if they are granted by the Department's process.  Unfortunately, this leads to the type of uncertainty for businesses whereby they might not be in a position to keep their doors open and retain the 1 million people who work in the SME sector.  I look forward to the speedy passage of the Bill.<\/p> <p> I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate Deputy English on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department.  I am certain he will bring the same zeal he brought to housing to this Department.  I wish him and the Minister well in their endeavours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200003#A00400","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595407200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I call Deputy O'Connor who, I am afraid, has just over a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200004#B00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1595407800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  It is at times like this we must recognise that we have to do things differently and act responsibly and urgently to address the severe challenges our economy faces in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.  This is the right time for the State to play a key role in our economy and to work side-by-side with businesses to get through this crisis.  That is why I welcome the decision of the European Commission to introduce the temporary framework for state aid which is the basis of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has much potential and I would like to use my time to speak on implementation.  Big ideas need action and successful implementation.  I would like to speak about the proposed amendment to section 3 of the 2012 Act which extends the scope of the credit guarantee scheme to primary agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture producers and the implementation of the scheme through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  On the inclusion of agriculture, I do not have to stand here and debate the importance of the agricultural sector to the Irish economy.  My constituency includes towns such as Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Mallow and I have a background in agriculture.  My region is very reliant on the agri-food sector.  I was pleased to note the inclusion of agriculture in the temporary framework for state aid.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, the House gave the agriculture sector a much-needed boost by extending the future growth loan scheme.

Many SMEs are starved of capital right now.  The reality is that these businesses are the backbone of our economy and provide much needed employment in the most rural and remote areas in the State.  They have, I am sure, contacted every single one of us to tell us they cannot cope with the onset of Covid-19.  For many this also involves the changes they will need to make to their businesses in order for them to be in line with public health advice.  These people, families and communities need to know we are doing everything in our power to ensure their survival.  For many rural areas the survival of these small and micro-businesses impacts on the survival of communities.<\/p>  <p>  One group of businesses that is gravely concerned about their livelihoods are the owners of bed and breakfast accommodation.  The tourism industry has fallen to its knees in recent months.  I spoke with one owner of bed and breakfast accommodation yesterday who told me she had not had a single knock on her door since March, meaning that she has had no income since then.  A women to whom I spoke highlighted the fact that she was a pensioner and, therefore, was ineligible for the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  As I have said in the Chamber, people have told me they are working not as a hobby but because they have bills and mortgages to pay.  They are unable to survive without this income.<\/p>  <p>  A key issue for the owners of bed and breakfast accommodation is that they are non-ratable businesses because they are businesses which are run in homes.  Therefore, certain grants are not available to them.  Another owner of bed and breakfast accommodation told me it was estimated to cost in the region of &euro;40,000 to make all of the necessary changes to be in line with public health advice.  This person has a mortgage that still needs to be paid, no visitors are knocking on the door and grants cannot be accessed.  The family told me they do not think they would be able to get a loan from a bank.  Non-ratable businesses need access to grants and assurances in the credit guarantee scheme.  Clearly, the scheme is there to assist businesses in acquiring much-needed capital so they can stay in business and preserve jobs.  <\/p>  <p>  Several problems with the scheme have been highlighted by my colleagues in recent days.  Today I would like to draw the attention of the House to another issue, namely, the timeliness of the appeals process for SMEs that have had their initial applications for finance turned down.  For many SMEs whose loan requests have been turned down by their respective banks, they will first have to exhaust their banks' internal appeals process before they can take an appeal to the Credit Review Office which acts as a type of ombudsman.  It overturns, on average, more than 50% of the appeals decisions that come before it.  Nevertheless, while it offers borrowers an independent review and, therefore, the right to an impartial appeal, this can be time consuming for many SMEs.  Given our current predicament, many small businesses simply cannot afford to wait up to three months while they exhaust their banks' internal appeals processes before they can appeal to the Credit Review Office.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to consider putting in place a mechanism which would allow SMEs which have had their requests for funding turned down by their banks to bypass internal appeals processes and be able to take appeals straight to the Credit Review Office, and that such a policy would remain in place for the duration of the Covid-19 crisis.  Furthermore, could the appeals fee, which ranges from &euro;100 to &euro;250, depending on the size of the credit involved, be refunded to the applicant given the current emergency?  If this would put too much pressure on the Credit Review Office and would simply move the backlog from banks to the appeals process, could the Minister request that banks establish internal dedicated credit guarantee appeals teams that would be responsible for assessing appeals within a short turnaround timeframe?  If an applicant is not satisfied with this appeal, he or she could bring the matter to the Credit Review Office.<\/p>  <p>  I would be also interested in hearing whether the Minister, in the event he can proceed with this proposal, could also commit to ensuring the figures on the rates of refusals and declines for loan applications and appeals are published.  This would alleviate a lot of the fears out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200005#C00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1595407800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>It is obvious to everyone that we have a situation across the country where many small businesses are under massive pressure as a result of Covid-19 and the onslaught it has brought on their cashflow.  They are trying to keep on employees and to keep their businesses afloat under the most difficult of circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lesson in all of this for the economic model we have used in Ireland for so long.  When there is a crisis, whether it is Covid-19, an economic crash or Brexit, who has to come to the rescue?  It is not the markets, yet at all other times we are told the markets are there to solve all of the problems.  They do not solve problems when there is a crisis.  Instead, it is up to the taxpayer and Government to come in and shore up and support businesses.  That is appropriate and proper, and it is exactly what we need to do right now.<\/p>  <p>  It is ironic, given the circumstances in which we find ourselves, that the way the Government has chosen to address the crisis is through a credit guarantee scheme, which of course is necessary.  However, the model it has again chosen is to provide help through the pillar banks.  The difficulty many small businesses have is that they are at the mercy of credit committees in these banks.  That has been always the case. <\/p>  <p>  Business owners who are looking for money are usually already under stress and in debt from trying to establish their businesses and keep them going.  When they go to banks to look for additional cash to keep cashflow going, to stay afloat and to get over a hill to the top so they can continue to flourish, they find they are meeting the same problem, namely, that the banks are the ones that are in control.  That is one of the major flaws in the proposal.  We continue to use pillar banks as if they were going to solve our problems.  They certainly will not, and in many cases we find that many of our small businesses are at their mercy.<\/p>  <p>  A lot of small businesses in Ireland are struggling even in ordinary times.  I have spoken to the owners of small businesses across my constituency who employ a small number of people and continue to work very hard and keep going even in these difficult circumstances.  They pay their way and are able to continue in business.  Crises like Covid-19 put them in a situation whereby they are now considering whether they should remain open or close.  Many are choosing to close.  <\/p>  <p>  That is one of the ironies of all of this, and it goes back to what I said at the beginning of my statement, namely, that the economic model we use in this country puts just enough support under people to get them started and then abandons them to the mercies of the markets.  That simply does not work in the long-term and we need to review that model as we move into the future so that if we face another crisis in one year or ten years' time we are not in a situation whereby the taxpayer has to come in and rescue businesses.  There must be a better and more sustainable model that works for everyone.<\/p>  <p>  Another aspect of this involves the European Union and the way it treats countries that choose to invest in their local and indigenous economies.  The Stability and Growth Pact states that Governments cannot invest in their economies, which is a significant problem.  Of course, many of the other countries in the EU, even Germany which is one of the most strident in defending this policy, break the rules and are most adventurous in investing in their economies and ensuring their indigenous economies are flourishing.<\/p> <p>At the same time, such countries punish other countries for trying to do the same thing.  The Government needs to become more adventurous and strident in ensuring that we develop our indigenous industries and economies, particularly in the regions.  I come for the north-west region and that part of the world has the greatest opportunity and potential in the country.  There is a highly educated workforce but, unfortunately, many of those from the area who get degrees and do well in life cannot find work in their local area and must travel to the east coast or leave the country altogether.  That is a part of the lesson that we need to learn.  We need investment in the economy that is deep and spread across the island so that we can ensure, come what may, we will have the strength to work our way through it.<\/p> <p> This credit guarantee scheme is necessary but the manner in which it is being rolled out is totally mistaken.  We should not be doing it through the banks.  We need to pump money in at the bottom of the economy so that people will spend it because if they do, they will keep the economy going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200005#C00400","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595408400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The past five months have been a very difficult time for the economy and people of Ireland.  Covid-19 has brought with it unexpected and unprecedented financial issues for many businesses which would otherwise have been sustainable.  Many workers have been left in limbo, not knowing whether they will have a job to go back to.  Sinn F&eacute;in therefore welcomes the Government's credit guarantee legislation which will make it easier for SMEs to access affordable credit.  In May, we wrote to the Minister for Finance and called for legislation similar to the Bill the Government is now implementing.  We are glad the Government has taken on board suggestions from Sinn F&eacute;in and listened to us.  We are determined to be an effective Opposition and want to provide real solutions to deal with serious issues such as this.<\/p>  <p>  A number of sectors are struggling in my constituency of Laois-Offaly, including the coach and bus industry, and the hospitality sector.  Many pub owners have their backs against the wall, as do others in the retail sector.  I have spoken to many people in these sorts of companies during the Covid emergency and in recent days.  They have told me that what they need right now is grants.  A large number of these businesses are already carrying substantial loans and the last thing they need is more debt.  They are already struggling and cannot afford to take on extra debt.  It is for that reason that Sinn F&eacute;in is calling for grants of up to &euro;25,000 for those SMEs.  There should be no interest accruing to loans under the credit guarantee scheme for the first 12 months.  Thereafter, only low interest should apply, no more than 2.5%, as opposed to the current scheme where up to 5.5% is being charged.  The rates waiver scheme, which has been successful in keeping businesses afloat, needs to be extended beyond 1 January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  It is also essential that the wage subsidy scheme continue for businesses that meet the criteria and qualify for it.  I stress that these schemes should mainly be for small and medium-sized businesses.  Many large companies are able to leverage credit and capital from the banks and are thereby able to stay afloat.  The loans and grants to which I am referring should only be for decent employers.  If the State, using taxpayers' money, gives a helping hand to the private sector, employers must uphold their side of the bargain by continuing to pay fair wages and upholding decent conditions for workers.  Employers should not use the emergency to slash the wages of workers.  We know that is happening and I have heard complaints from workers that some businesses have not wasted a good crisis.  It is unacceptable for a business to use this opportunity to slash the wages of workers even when it is availing of the wage subsidy scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should also implement the voucher scheme that Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a few weeks ago.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a voucher scheme for families who take a staycation.  The vouchers could be spent on anything in the hospitality sector, excluding alcohol.  That would get tens of thousands of workers back into employment and give families a badly needed break.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to make a positive contribution to the economic recovery, which will be difficult.  We are glad that many of our proposals are being taken on board.  That is good news.  We need to stimulate the economy and get money circulating again.  That will, in turn, generate revenue for the State through the universal social charge, PRSI, PAYE and VAT.

Unpaid invoices have a knock-on effect on the whole of the supply chain and we need to be conscious of that.  Whether we are talking about a small food supplier, a self-employed person or whatever else it may be, the negative multiplier effect, in that sense, is something for which we need to watch out because businesses will be collapsing under the radar.<\/p>  <p>  All this has meant that staff have been let go, payments have been deferred and businesses have been forced to close altogether.

That said, I strongly urge the Minister to look at the rest of the proposals made by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Bill improves the credit guarantee scheme but we need to do far more.  This legislation does not get us away from the fact that an injection of cash through grant aid is required.  Sinn F&eacute;in has spoken about that necessity and has acted accordingly in the North by supplying grants for small businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  We know that small businesses are struggling right across the country.  For example, coach and bus operators are struggling, as my colleague, Deputy Stanley, mentioned.  Those businesses have been hit extremely hard.  I have been in contact with owners of such businesses in my constituency and despite how hard their businesses have been hit, they are clear that they can only stay in business if there is genuine support for them.  They are watching the activities of the D&aacute;il with interest and hoping that no one in the Government is asleep at the wheel.  Those business owners agree with Sinn F&eacute;in's assessment of the credit guarantee scheme.  They knew straightaway that it was badly designed and would mean higher interest rates that would be of little assistance to small businesses such as theirs.  The amendment is a small step in the right direction towards supporting industries such as the coach tourism sector and many others but more needs to be done.  The country cannot function without a proper transport system that serves all areas, no matter how remote.  The business owners that I am talking about have invested heavily, are already carrying debt and cannot bear any more, particularly at high interest rates.  <\/p>  <p>  Much has been said about the opening of so-called wet pubs.  Regardless of the rights and wrongs of this, they have been asked by the Government to stay closed for the safety of everyone, like many other businesses.  Owners of such pubs need to know that the Government is doing all it can to put the necessary supports in place.  The Government cannot make decisions in isolation.  It must ensure that these viable yet vulnerable businesses are supported in order that they can continue to trade.  It must work with the Opposition and listen to our ideas, not dismiss them out of hand for political reasons.<\/p>  <p>  The accommodation and food sectors have experienced an extreme shock across the board.  The Central Bank, in its report, states that 77% of businesses in the sector have reported turnover more than 75% below normal.  We must look at the supply chains in that regard, as we must with dry cleaners and launderettes.  Between 60% and 80% of income in dry cleaning and launderette businesses comes from the hospitality sector.  It is important that dry cleaners and launderettes are considered and aligned with the hospitality sector so that we can keep those businesses up and running.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill increases to 80% the portfolio cap in the Government's Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme and I welcome that, although it should be higher, as Sinn F&eacute;in has suggested.  Without the removal of the cap, banks would refuse to lend to small businesses in dire need of affordable loans.  As has already been said, Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing a cap on interest rates at 2.5%.  The interest rates on the loans provided to date are too high.<\/p> <p> The issues were flagged by Sinn F&eacute;in shortly after the loan scheme was announced in May.  This was communicated to the Minister for Finance and the Minister with responsibility for business.  My earliest contribution in the D&aacute;il was on interest rates and the amount of money the banks would be making on the back of these struggling businesses.  The reasons loans would be unattractive to smaller businesses were outlined.  Today, one of these issues is being addressed.  I urge the Government to look at the other issues highlighted as a matter of urgency.  Businesses need a minimum of a 12-month window guarantee before they make repayments on loans and they also need guaranteed low-interest payments.<\/p> <p> There is so much uncertainty about the future.  The situation regarding a vaccine is evolving.  I hope we will have a vaccine sooner rather than later.  However, we will not get back to a normality whereby these businesses can trade until there is a vaccine in place.  That needs to be reflected in terms of what the Government is doing.  These are vulnerable but viable businesses that we depend on for employment.  We depend on having these businesses in our communities to allow them, particularly those in rural Ireland, to be prosperous and viable.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill, but much more needs to be done.  The key words are \"simplicity\" and \"urgency\" in the context of getting the money to the right places at the right time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200006#D00300","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595409000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I remind the House that the debate on this Bill must conclude at 10.30 a.m.  Our next slot is a Government one.

The Government has my full support.  This legislation to extend the option of overdrafts, term loans and working capital for small and medium-sized businesses that have been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic is welcome.  It is important that we support viable businesses and ensure that our entrepreneurs do not go to the wall because of something that was completely beyond their control.<\/p>  <p>  I am keen to encourage robust scrutiny of this loan scheme to ensure that the taxpayer will not be on the hook because we failed to engage in due diligence at this stage of the process.  It is important that these credit agreements will be accessed not only by those who have the means but also by those who do not.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise another issue.  Some banks refused to issue mortgages to people who were put on wage subsidy schemes.  Are businesses going to suffer the same fate?  These businesses abided by the public health advice, closed for the pandemic and are now reopening with less potential for profit than before.  Will they be denied these loans because their bank balances are less pretty than they were previously?<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Guarantee Act 2012 and the subsequent amending legislation refer to where a participating finance provider fails or refuses to comply with the terms of a credit guarantee scheme and provides that the Minister may withdraw a guarantee given in respect of any qualifying finance agreement to which the participating finance provider is a party.  Is there are a commitment in respect of businesses if banks refuse to lend to those which have traded at a loss in recent months but which had been viable previously?  Will they have some recourse?  Does the guarantee provide that these businesses can still qualify for the credit facilities?  Obviously, we cannot interfere with the day-to-day running of the banks.  However, can we assure those who might want to apply that the banks will lend?  Have the main financial providers told the Government that these credit facilities can be accessed immediately?  What is the timeline regarding decisions?  Can businesses receive guidance on how long they can expect to wait for approval?<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask about VAT.  I have been speaking to those in hospitality and the vintners.  I have had several Zoom meetings with them.  The biggest issue they face is the need for a reduction in VAT to 9%.  They believe that will keep their doors open.  Is there any way we can do that to keep this sector going?<\/p>  <p>  I have also had Zoom meetings with barbers and hairdressers and other small businesses.  The biggest concern they have is that we will go into a second phase of lockdown.  If we do, some believe that it will not be viable for them to reopen and they will not be able to keep their doors closed.  This morning, I listened to RT&Eacute; Radio 1.  A health professional was interviewed and outlined his belief that are we looking at the prospect of staying in our counties again.  The biggest issue is the schools.  These are all major issues for businesses.  Perhaps the Minister of State could come back on this point.<\/p>  <p>  The main thing is a commitment to manage the uncertainty for businesses in order that they can survive.  Is there any way we can look at the fact that online businesses outside Ireland are free to advertise their prices without VAT while Irish companies cannot do so?  Obviously, the customer pays the VAT, but it seems unfair to Irish businesses trading online that they are immediately at a disadvantage.  Maybe the Minister can come back to me on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200007#E00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1595409000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I am pleased to see the Bill proceeding through the D&aacute;il today.  It will be important as we look to kick-start our economy in a Covid-19 era.  The Bill will enable the distribution of low-cost loans to many businesses affected by the global pandemic.  That will be a great help.<\/p>  <p>  Equally important and as significant as those low-cost loans will be the July stimulus programme.  It will include a suite of measures and supports to aid the Irish public and hospitality sectors.  Those supports and incentives need to be decisive and strong.  The reality is the pub sector in particular has suffered adversely throughout this crisis.  We have to acknowledge the great contribution made by publicans.  Let us think back to early March.  Many of our rural and country publicans led by example.  They put their hands up first and said they were closing their bars in the national interest, in the interests of public health and, more importantly, in the interest of the welfare of their local communities.  They did so ahead of any talk about a national lockdown.  They did so prior to any talk about Covid-19 payments.  They did so ahead of any talk about a business restart.  They were completely selfless.  The broad cohort of publicans have behaved admirably throughout this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair and reasonable to say that as of now publicans are angry and frustrated.  Their eagerly awaited reopening has been delayed.  It is understandable and correct that the public health advice has been that we should delay the reopening.  However, it is incumbent on the House, specifically in respect of the July incentive package which will be unveiled later this week, to deliver clear, meaningful and strong incentives to encourage as many publicans as possible to come back to the fold.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that, owing to Covid-19 social distancing guidelines, public health requirements and, unfortunately, a general downturn in the economic viability of the pub sector as a result of Covid-19, many of our pubs will not reopen.  Everyone in the House is well aware of the significance and importance of the community pub to rural Ireland as well as the importance of the traditional pub to our tourism model.  That is why it is so important that we need to see strong and meaningful support from the House this week.  We need a business incentive scheme to encourage as many of our rural pubs as possible to reopen on 10 August.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200007#E00400","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1595409000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>There are 12 minutes remaining.

That is certainly welcome for businesses that are now at the pin of their collar.  This will offer some much-needed liquidity as they try to get back on their feet.  It is good news on top of last week's financial provisions and microenterprise loan fund legislation.  It proves that in the early weeks of this Government there has been a real willingness on this side of the House to prime local businesses to ensure that they are in the fittest and healthiest financial state possible as they try to resurrect, get back to work and start doing what they do best.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of outliers.  I want to briefly mention one of these to the Minister of State.  A man came to Dublin last week.  He arrived at the gates of Leinster House.  His name is Sean Kilkenny.  He is a colourful character from Tuamgraney in east Clare.  He got plenty of coverage on the national airwaves.  Sean Kilkenny operates a jarvey business in east Clare.  He has beautiful carriages that at this time of year would normally operate in and around the grounds of Dromoland Castle.  He has a range of other carriages that are used for funerals and weddings.  He has 42 or 43 animals, including some beautiful Connemara ponies and Irish draught horses.  He is really holding up and shoring up a rural economy, providing a vital tourism industry in the region.<\/p> <p>Mr. Kilkenny is in one of those outlier situations.  He is getting his Covid-19 related payment of &euro;350, but he has major operating costs.  We need to see scope within the July stimulus and the measures we are adopting this week to support and benefit those such as Mr. Kilkenny to ensure these businesses will not go to the wall during this crisis.  Owners of bed and breakfasts also have issues, particularly those over the age of 66 as they are not eligible for Covid-19 payments.  They also find themselves outside the qualifying net for several supports already announced. <\/p> <p> My final point concerns bank loans, because I understand that what we are approving this week will be dispersed through the Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank.  Defaulting on any standing order with a bank, or even a missed direct debit relating to a Vodafone or ESB bill, will mean that a person's credit rating will go sour.  Credit ratings are fragile.  The very people who will look for this finance in late July and August as they try to refinance their businesses, therefore, are probably the same people who have defaulted on basic, simple and small direct debits that were unable to come from their accounts because of a lack of liquidity.  Going on the credit ratings system will mean that some of these people will go into the bank, with all of their paperwork in order and with a credible claim for a loan, but they will not be able to get it because they defaulted on some small basic payments in the previous six months during the Covid-19 crisis.  This issue will be a major anomaly affecting many people, so I urge the Minister to look at it and give some assurances to SMEs. <\/p> <p> I join others from my party who have spoken about publicans.  What has happened thus far has had to be guided by public health guidance and we all accept that fully.  There has, however, been a disproportionate benefit to those who run food-serving pubs in urban constituencies, as opposed to those in rural areas who can see no light at the end of the tunnel.  That situation needs to remain fluid and more clarity needs to be brought to this area by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200007#E00600","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595409600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>There are seven minutes remaining.

Businesses that in normal times would be on a sound financial footing are now under significant economic pressure, unfortunately, because their working capital is completely tied up or their cash flow has stopped.  That is why I am delighted to have this opportunity to welcome the credit guarantee scheme.  A sum of &euro;2 billion sounds like a ferocious amount but there is much pent-up demand for this credit scheme.  Our SMEs are very important and it is essential that we do everything in our power to help them.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of this loan scheme must be kept to a minimum.  We have seen other initiatives where interest rates have been quoted at between 4% and 5%.  That is not acceptable given the cost of money on the financial markets.  The reality is that the public and businesspeople have completely lost confidence in the banks.  Every week, people come into my clinics who have been trying to get mortgages and some who had already been approved for mortgages by financial institutions.  Like many hundreds of thousands of other people, they have gone on supporting payments because of changed circumstances due to the coronavirus or they have moved jobs and have gone on to contract employment.  The banks are refusing to honour their previous commitments to people seeking mortgages.  We devote much attention in this House to the housing crisis and rightly so.  The issue regarding the ability of young couples to avail of mortgages during this pandemic must get more attention.  The way our banks are treating these people has to come under greater scrutiny.  I urge the Minister to give directives to the banks regarding people who, through no fault of their own, have changed circumstances.  The commitments given to those people should be honoured.<\/p>  <p>  The July stimulus package, of approximately &euro;7 billion, will also be announced this week.  I reiterate that the pressure on businesses is immense.  Two weeks ago during a Topical Issue debate, I made a plea on behalf of private bus operators.  They are under great pressure and they are the cornerstone of the infrastructure for our tourism industry.  Like many other sectors, those businesses will not recover even in 2021 or 2022.  Even if the pandemic goes well and a vaccine is found, those businesses will not return to where they would have been even in 2022 and they will need ongoing help into the future.  We have some of the big operators in that sector in our neck of the woods and they are a key part of our tourism infrastructure.  Those operators have buses sitting in their yards that were bought new this spring for &euro;350,000 in preparation for this year's tourism season.  The problems for those operators are not going to go away today, tomorrow or even in six months.<\/p>  <p>  Like other Deputies, I was disappointed that the pubs were not allowed to open.  I accept fully that decisions regarding the health of our citizens are paramount.  Unfortunately, rural publicans cannot understand how pubs in large urban centres can open while those pubs that would count ten or 15 people a big crowd cannot.  Restricted admission might have got us over some of the problems that the health officials thought the opening of rural pubs might cause.  The health experts told us that when the economy started to reopen that cases would increase.  That is normal, because people are mixing more and that was bound to happen.  Publicans need clear guidance and they were very cross at the lateness of this decision.  All the indications coming up to last weekend and last Monday suggested that pubs would be allowed to open.  Many publicans had ordered stock, serviced their coolers and incurred additional expense.  These are people who have had no cash flow since mid-March.  If there are going to be changes to the roadmap, those changes need to be signposted well in advance.  <\/p>  <p>  Like my fellow Government Deputies, I welcome this initiative.  The costs for businesses, however, must be kept at a reasonable level.  Our businesses and SMEs never wanted help more if we are going to reboot our economy.  Figures are being bandied about this week regarding the large amounts that will be coming from the EU, but that is over a seven-year period.  Many businesses will need grants as well as loans and businesses in some sectors that are under more pressure than others.  This is a unique situation and austerity will not solve it.  We must spend our way out of this crisis and we must give help to these businesses to get back on an even keel and to do that as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200008#F00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1595409600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Most Members agree, therefore, that this is the right approach to take regarding this intervention.  Again, this is only one initiative and some &euro;12 billion more in supports will be announced as part of the July stimulus plan.  This is a mechanism to ensure we can get our banks lending those who need it at good interest rates as quickly as we can.<\/p>  <p>  Many comments reflected on the existing scheme that has been operating since 2012.

This is, therefore, a very different scheme.  We are changing the portfolio cap and the businesses that can be supported, and we have no doubt that this scheme will work and will be able to respond to the demands created by the impact of Covid-19.  People are making judgements on a scheme that was not necessarily needed in the seven to eight years pre-Covid-19.

The task force will build on the work carried out already in the Department in this area, which included a symposium to investigate the possibility of creative nightlife and cultural activity after hours and the establishment of pilot projects in both Cork and Dublin, which intended to provide a more detailed insight into the specific issues facing the development of a night-time culture and to seek wider public views.

The support and cooperation of key Departments, agencies and local authorities will be vital to the success of this initiative, and my Department is writing to them to seek nominations to the task force.

Hedgerows are very important wildlife habits, providing food, shelter, corridors of movement, nesting and hibernation sites for many of our native flora and fauna.  There are approximately 400,000 km of hedges in this country.  In general, it is permissible to cut hedges during the winter period mentioned in the question.  While under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, there are restrictions on cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation from 1 March to 31 August, this prohibition does not apply from 1 September to 28 February of the following year.  Even during the closed period between March and August, there is provision in the legislation for some restricted exemptions from this prohibition.  For example, there are exemptions for works undertaken in the ordinary course of agriculture, forestry and for road safety reasons.<\/p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Heritage Act included a limited power to make regulations for a period of two years after the passing of the Act to allow cutting of roadside hedges during the month of August, subject to conditions.  That provision has now lapsed and it is not the intention to seek to renew it.  In July last year my predecessor announced that she would not be proceeding with the making of regulations for August of that year.  The decision recognised the increased threats to biodiversity nationally and globally and followed a number of Government initiatives to protect and nurture Ireland's flora and fauna and a D&aacute;il declaration on a climate and biodiversity emergency.<\/p>  <p>  At the time there was extensive public debate and engagement by my Department on this matter, including during the national biodiversity conference in Dublin last year, hosted together with the Irish Forum on Natural Capital.  Arising from the conference, the Seeds for Nature initiative was launched, which comprised a range of initiatives for nature and biodiversity.  In addition, there was a wide public consultation on the Heritage Ireland 2030 plan, debates in the D&aacute;il on biodiversity loss and extensive engagement across the Government on the climate action plan, including by my Department.  The climate action plan made a number of references to the importance of hedgerows.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to underline that the current legislation allows both landowners and public authorities to cut hedges for road safety reasons at any time of the year.  Under the roads legislation, landowners are obliged to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or any other vegetation is not a hazard for persons using public roads.  In addition, local authorities have the legal power to cut roadside hedges for road safety reasons during any month of the year.  Therefore, there is no legal obstacle to both landowners and local authorities ensuring that country roads are safe for road users, whether drivers, cyclists or walkers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200012#K00600","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1595412000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I bring the Minister of State back to my original question.

The Department also supports a number of postgraduate projects in universities.  The results from much of this work are published in the Irish wildlife manual series on the NPWS website.  Included in the publications this year alone are works on marine habitats, surveys of squirrels and pine martens, breeding waders and coastal grasslands, and a European checklist of mosses and ferns.

The control of live hare coursing, including the operation of individual coursing meetings and managing the use of hares for that activity, is carried out under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  The statute is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  My responsibility relates to the conservation status of the hare.  While the regulation of hare coursing is not under my statutory control, licences are required by the Irish Coursing Club under the terms of the Wildlife Acts on behalf of their affiliated clubs to facilitate the netting and tagging of hares for closed park meetings.  The annual licence to capture and tag hares for the 2019-2020 coursing season was issued by my Department on 9 August last year.  The licences granted by my Department in such instances include a range of conditions relating to coursing hares that were designed to provide as much protection as possible to the conservation status of the hare.<\/p>  <p>  The RHD2 virus, which affects rabbits and hares, was discovered in several rabbits and hares around the country during last summer.  The scientific advice available to my Department at the time and following the issuing of annual licences indicated that the virus was highly contagious and easily spread.  Moreover, the Department was advised that catching of hares in nets and keeping them in transportation boxes and confined areas like coursing hare parks could all be considered to increase the risk of disease spread.  In these circumstances, given my Department's responsibility in respect of the conservation status of the Irish hare, it was decided to suspend the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club on 9 August last year until a clearer understanding of the context, spread and implications of RHD2 was developed.  A revised more restrictive licence was subsequently issued to the Irish Coursing Club in October 2019 effective to the end of February this year following discussions between the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Irish Coursing Club on the impact of the virus.  The restrictions included the condition that the capturing of hares and coursing activity was prohibited in areas within a 25 km radius of where wild rabbits or hares had tested positive for the virus.  New zones were added on an ongoing basis as positive tests arose and in these new zones the capturing of hares was to cease immediately.  Coursing would only be possible with already captured hares and where the hares were certified in writing by a veterinary surgeon as being healthy.  Such hares would only be released back into the wild on foot of such certification.  This impacted on a significant number of coursing events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200016#O00600","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1595414400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I do not think the Minister of State quite answered the question.

The Department has said that it is working with colleagues and that it will sample rabbits from hunting bags at different locations.  In the absence of that scientific data we need to take a precautionary approach in addressing this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The hare is an iconic endemic species in Ireland.  There have been instances of this disease in the UK recent years.  In some areas there up to 70% of the population was wiped out.  We cannot afford to allow that to happen to our hare population.  It is important that we restrict and suspend licences at this point until we have sufficient research data available to us that can specify how widespread it is in our population across the country.  It is not enough to know where cases involving hares are found.  We must be proactive in sampling.  Until that happens we should suspend licences.

There is absolute public confusion and a lack of public confidence in the Government&rsquo;s whole approach which has been marked as cack-handed and, frankly, operating on a wing and a prayer.  Yesterday the Taoiseach was at odds with the T&aacute;naiste, and the confusion between the two hardly adds to public confidence.  Instead of managing the risks that we clearly face, he has now pursued a reckless policy with virtually no checks and balances.<\/p>  <p>  In the small hours of last night the Government published its green list in which it itemised 15 countries and territories for which it has reduced the security profile.  It has put itself at odds with the public health advice, which is that there be no international travel, and has at once said to the public that they can travel with reduced risks but has asked that they do not do so.  Ordinary people have been thrown under the bus.  They face the situation that those who listen to the public health advice and forgo their holidays are potentially out of pocket by thousands of euro.  Those who do not heed the public health advice and travel will do so uninsured.<\/p>  <p>  The other problem is that the Taoiseach and Government have not produced a red list of those countries and zones where there is a very high prevalence of this virus.  There is a deep concern that people are travelling to this island from those places, and when they arrive here, they are asked simply to fill out a form and restrict their movements.  There is no isolation and no proper form of quarantine.  Putting a form online is not going to address any of this.<\/p>  <p>  I also remind the Taoiseach that the bottom line outside of holiday season is to get our children back to school, to get people back to education and back to work safely and keep them at work safely.  We need to get back to basics and the Government needs to have a proper plan and strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I have two questions.  First, what will the Taoiseach do to support those families who listen to the public health advice and do not travel internationally and find themselves out of pocket, in some cases by thousands of euros?  Second, what is he doing to protect public health on the island from travel into the country from those places with a very high prevalence of the virus?  What proper operable and effective quarantine and safety measures will he put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200018#Q00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1595415600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question.

I am clear that the safest thing to do is not to travel.  That is the clear message.  We are saying to people to holiday at home this year.  We have in respect of those 15 countries applied the normal precautions appellation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which basically means that when people return home, they will not have to restrict their movements.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy and her party had a view that it was okay to open up the island to 59 countries.  That is a fact.  The Northern Ireland Executive signed up a fortnight ago to an opening up of the island.  We are taking a much more conservative approach here.  All of the 15 countries would have fewer than five infected persons in 100,000.  They are actually safer right now, if I use that phrase, or have a lower incidence, to be more accurate, then we do here in the Republic.  I did point that out and I understand that there are different jurisdictions and all of that, but this was signed off on by Sinn F&eacute;in in Northern Ireland.  That has to be said.  I am still willing to work constructively to see how we can protect the island, because it raises challenges for us.<\/p>  <p>  We decided last evening to move the passenger locator form to an electronic basis.  The key, if we are honest, is testing and contact tracing.  That remains the gold standard in trying to suppress the virus.  The timing of the engagement, the quicker one can contact the person who may be a contact of someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, is the key response to determine our future capacity to keep on top of the virus.<\/p>  <p>  I also make the point, and it has to be said, that in the first 12 days of July 2019, we were looking at 1.469 million people arriving in through Dublin Airport.  The figure this July is about 134,000 people.  There has been a lot of hype and concern about travel.  I acknowledge the concern but we need to keep it in perspective.  There has been a 91% drop in travel through Dublin Airport in the first 12 days of July between this year and last year.  The issue, as I said yesterday, is how we live with Covid-19 over the next 12 to 15 months in the absence of a vaccine being discovered.  That is something that should exercise all of us in this House in terms of the broader challenges facing society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200018#Q00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1595415600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I hope that the T&aacute;naiste desists from the type of sniping that the Taoiseach has described.

Our position is well known within the five party Executive, which is that we need every protection for the island as a single unit.  That means effective quarantining methods and not placing a form online and championing this as some great transformation and intervention.  It is not.  It is about testing, tracing, isolating and having effective and robust procedures for those 134,000 people who have arrived on our island.  Currently, that is not the case and well the Taoiseach knows it.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of families here and their holiday plans, the Irish Travel Agents Association estimate that &euro;800,000 a day is being lost by consumers.  These are the immediate people caught in the crossfire of this.

That is very important.  I acknowledge, however, the de facto situation in terms of the roles and responsibilities of the Northern Executive and the fact that it is connected to the public health advice in the UK.  There are issues that we should acknowledge in that respect.  People will say in a throwaway phrase that it should be all-Ireland, and we will all agree with that.  The reality of doing that, however, is clearly challenging.  The joint memorandum between the chief medical officers in the North and in the Republic is good.<\/p> <p>That is a welcome start.  The North-South Ministerial Council will give us a further opportunity and I welcome the fact that we are having it at the end of July for the first time in three and a half years.  That will give us an opportunity to create structures to discuss these things.  We discussed travel in a constructive way last week.

We are strengthening our position on incoming travel, low though it is compared with prior to Covid.<\/p> <p> On the Deputy's question about supporting people, there have been significant and unprecedented supports through the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme for the population in general.  We have not come forward with specific proposals relating to compensation of those who perhaps had to cancel holidays that they perhaps booked some time ago.

It was made a border inspection post second only to Dublin because of this.  However, no Government has applied for it to have tier 1 status so that it can access financial supports from the EU for infrastructural development in line with its strategic position.  The programme for Government of 2016, under the heading about attracting jobs and investment and TEN-T funding, states: \"In the first three months the new Government will apply to the European Union for the revision of the TEN-T CORE Network, including applying for the reinstatement of the crossborder Western Arc.\"  That included Rosslare Europort.  This never happened and the programme for Government of 2020 does not mention it either.<\/p>  <p>  It would follow that if the reason for adding Rosslare to the core network was to create jobs and investment, then not to do so will result in the loss of jobs and investment.  It will not stop there.  The Government's negligence in not applying to the EU to make Rosslare a core network port like Dublin and Foynes will result in a failure to keep Ireland's exports and imports competitive.  Commercial traffic will slow down because of increased regulation when Brexit is upon us at the end of the year.  As an island nation, 90% of goods are moved by roll-on, roll-off freight services.  The road freight transport sector will be subject to new EU legislation known as the mobility package which is detrimental to Ireland because of our geographic location on the periphery of the mainland EU.  The need for a daily direct service to circumvent the chaos of the landbridge will never be greater.  These calls have been ignored and to continue doing so will lead to a significant increase in delays, leading to an increase in cost for the landbridge that will not work.  The people of Ireland will be unforgiving when rising consumer costs for the most basic of items such as bread and sugar, as well as job losses, could have been avoided.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to tell the country why the Government is neglecting to take actions that should be taken to keep the country from catastrophe now and post Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200019#R00300","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1595416200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question and for raising the key issues pertaining to Rosslare Europort.  In the context of Brexit, the Government is acutely aware of the necessity to work with the port and the Department and offices responsible in preparing for additional border controls and other impacts that will arise from Brexit.  We acknowledge the role of Rosslare in that regard.  The Deputy is correct that, given the challenges and difficulties that will arise with regard to the landbridge post Brexit, we need to make sure we utilise and maximise all available facilities and capacity that we have.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the tier 1 proposal, I think the Deputy is aware of how all of that developed in 2013 with the designation of ports on the basis of overall tonnage.  At the time, the tier 2 ports received 2.5% of overall tonnage through Irish ports.  Tier 1 ports received 15% to 20%.  Post Brexit, the situation is changing and we have to diversify our approach.  I know Rosslare Europort has been involved with the county council and the private sector and is seeking a free zone in that area.  It is especially anxious to exploit the forthcoming opportunities that wind energy will present.  We would be interested in combining both opportunities because there will be significant investment in wind energy over the next years.  Ports will play an important role in servicing such activity.  I hear the Deputy about the fundamental point of moving from tier to tier, but that obviously has broader implications related to port policy in general.  There is the ongoing issue which we are all aware of with the ownership of the port and structures governing it.  It is unique among the State's commercial ports and we should work on creating a better status for the port in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200019#R00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1595416200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>On the Taoiseach's comments about ownership, it is not an obstacle to something like applying for tier 1 status.

I remind the Taoiseach that Foynes did not meet the requirements either.  It was intimated that it was more to do with the Minister for Finance at the time coming from the same county.  I appreciate the Taoiseach's comments about the free zone.  He will know that Britain is preparing to apply for ten free zones post Brexit to prepare for the backlash of leaving the EU.  I propose that Rosslare Europort become a free zone to allow an intake of stored goods and supplies that was not necessary until now because of the customs union.  We tend not to store products.  We must capitalise where possible and make Rosslare a free zone, which is the smartest way to allay fears that cash flows will be eaten up by duties and taxes on goods and storage, which will only serve to drive costs up again if that storage is not contained in a free zone.  The land is available around Rosslare.  The interest has been mooted, as the Taoiseach said.  Brexit makes it a necessity.

That is essentially for the modernisation and digitisation of the port itself.  We have to re-examine broader policy as a result of Brexit.  It is in that context that I take note of the Deputy's comments about the change from tier 2 to tier 1 status.  I want to do so in an informed, structured way, and it has to be in the context of broader port policy.

In the context of the programme for Government and the issue of community safety, how will the return to school be policed?  People are travelling by air and by ferry.  There must be a system linked to passport numbers in order that schools can be alerted in advance about children who should be isolating.

One of our overarching priorities or objectives - this is why we have taken a very cautious approach, particularly in terms of the commencement of phase 4 and the compulsory wearing of masks on public transport - which I ensured happened the week before last and with which the public complied very quickly - relates to getting our schools open at the end of August.  That is essential for the well-being of the children of the nation and their development.  To me, it is the number one priority.  Alongside it is the resumption of the non-Covid-19 strand of health services.  In my view, there is clear guidance to the effect that anyone who travels outside of the 15 countries we identified should, without question, restrict their movements when they return to Ireland.  We do not want families travelling to holiday destinations outside of those 15 countries in the first place.  It is very important that they do not risk the capacity of schools to reopen or create situations that could lead to the spread of the virus.  It is extremely important that we all adhere to the guidance and the guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has done well in respect of Covid-19.  The levels of the virus are still low here.  It is important to make that point.  I am just back from the European Council and it was noticeable that some member states are finding difficulties in reopening.  As they have reopened, the incidence rate in some countries has increased significantly and this has resulted in localised and citywide lockdowns.  We want to avoid that in Ireland at all costs.  This really speaks to two things, namely, our individual behaviour and the behaviour of families and communities and, aligned to that, the need, as I said earlier, to develop a strong and speedy testing and contact tracing system.  To be fair, in the past month alone, a substantial number of tests have taken place on a systemic basis, for example, within nursing homes across the country.  That type of targeted work will continue.  The speed of that service will be very important in enabling us to suppress the spread of the virus into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200020#S00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1595416800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I agree with everything the Taoiseach said but the best way forward in respect of this matter is to take an all-island approach.

Using the passport system to police the pandemic is the fastest way to track anyone leaving the country or coming into it.  Be it children, parents or whomever, everyone should be tracked when leaving and when coming back.  There should be a system to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to trace people when they come back into the country.  In the context of schools, such a system would show when families return to Ireland.  If a member of a family returns to a household, having been abroad in one of the high-risk areas outside of the 15 countries, then the family must isolate.  This would ensure that other children within the school system would not be put at risk.  The majority of people are cognisant of Covid-19 and are very respectful of the rules.  However, there is a minority of people who do not care and it is these individuals that we must police.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200020#S00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1595416800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The electronic locator form will give us the capacity to follow up on the contacts of anyone who tests positive for Covid-19.

I appreciate that many of the issues the Government has had to deal with have been complex, but nevertheless the decisions have been slow.<\/p><p>One of the issues I have raised recently relates to the Shannon Group and its importance beyond Clare across the entire mid-west.  Shannon Airport is in great difficulty, as is the aviation sector generally.  There is much of confusion with regard to quarantining rules.  The previous speaker called for people to self-isolate.  There is a lot of concern and a growing hostility in the country to the effect that incoming tourists are flouting our laws.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, no less, in an article last Saturday, stated that garda&iacute; need to implement our laws.  I put it to the Taoiseach that in reality there is no law to implement.  There is no legal requirement for anybody coming into the country to quarantine, regardless of where they come from.  I wonder why that is the case.  Is it based on the legal requirement of being in the EU?  Of course we can limit freedom of movement or travel in the EU but to do so our actions must be proportionate and clear and whatever we do must be done lawfully.  In Ireland, there is a question as to whether it is either proportionate or lawful because the entire burden is being put back on ordinary people rather than the State actually doing what the State is able to do, which is to bring in laws.  If we think that people should not be coming in from Italy, then make them quarantine.  We are, however, allowing people to go to Italy.  Italy is not the issue, it is countries such as the United Kingdom - or parts of it - the United States and many others.<\/p><p>More importantly, what is the Taoiseach going to do outside of the aviation sector in Shannon?  We are asking people to holiday at home and many of them are doing so.  Many others are foregoing sums of money they had saved to go on holidays.  Are these people going to get any help from the Government in that regard?  Why are aeroplanes taking off from Dublin and Shannon and flying to areas that we deem not to be safe?  If it is a requirement under EU law, then spell it out and spell it out clearly.<\/p> <p>The effect of it is that Aer Lingus and Ryanair are flying those planes in order that they can say to passengers their flight is going whether they go or not.  It is increasingly looking like the case that ordinary people have to bear the brunt of everything while big corporations can continue to do as they like, make no refunds whatsoever and nothing happens.<\/p> <p> I raised the issue of Shannon Heritage here before.

That is ultimately why we are here.  That legislation will underpin the July stimulus programme that we will announce this week.  Hopefully, that may be of some assistance to the heritage issue the Deputy raised and will give additional capacity and supports to enable people to deal with the crisis that Covid-19 has brought about.  To be fair, the Deputy has raised that issue consistently as well as the issue of the Shannon Group and Shannon Airport.<\/p>  <p>  The problem in aviation is the fact that travel has collapsed.  Despite all of the talk and headlines around travel, the reality is that from 1 July to 12 July last year we had 2.69 million people in and out of Dublin Airport while this month, a year on, the figure is 134,000 people.

The Taoiseach cannot on one hand look to the North and say we can see what it has done because Britain has a particular position and it has gone along with it.  The island is partitioned and that is why we feel the long or invisible hand, at times, of British influence on the island.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot simply rely on the memorandum of understanding and I am well aware that such a memorandum exists.  I am also well aware that it is insufficient for our purposes.  One cannot stand back passively and say it is a different jurisdiction while at the same time advance the case that I hope the Taoiseach is advancing that for the purposes of public health, we are a single epidemiological unit.  The Taoiseach must make up his mind and this must be grounded in science, data and evidence etc.  All this evidence points to the fact that for this island to be safe, we do not need oversight or a distant set of observations but rather an all-Ireland approach.<\/p>  <p>  At the North-South Ministerial Council, and both before and after it, will the Taoiseach actively pursue that approach?  This would be instead of simply making observations or citing in the D&aacute;il how there have been phone calls from one chief medical officer to another.  I would expect that to happen but it is not enough.  We need a coherent single island approach.  Will the Taoiseach work actively for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200025#X00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1595419800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I must say to the Deputy that she cannot have it both ways.

The paper argues that the crisis demonstrates the capacity of Government to take swift and decisive action.  It adds that the introduction of legislation to ban evictions and rent increases and in securing additional accommodation for homeless households is the evidence of that.  Another important point it notes is the increased co-operation between official bodies and voluntary agencies in dealing with homelessness and their shared proactive approach to protecting homeless people from the virus.  NESC warns that tenants who have built up arrears during the crisis are now exposed to eviction when the ban expires and as a result believes it is important that it be extended yet despite this advice offered weeks ago from an agency under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government saw fit to wait until literally the 11th hour to extend the ban by a miserly ten days.  Surely even the Taoiseach would accept that this is at best incompetence on the part of his Minister and at worst an indication of what is to come in terms of housing policy from his Government.  The dogs in the street know that tens of thousands of renters work in sectors of the economy that will not return to full employment this year.  Some have yet to return to work at all due to public health guidelines.  The Taoiseach's Government's mishandling of this issue has added to the enormous uncertainty that they face.  As Fianna F&aacute;il housing spokesperson, the current Minister has had months to prepare for the extension of the ban on evictions and rent increases.  This plan should literally have been top of his agenda when taking up his Ministry.  We now understand that he will bring legislation to Cabinet tomorrow to be published on Friday.  The Taoiseach knows that rent-related legislation is technical.  The previous Minister had a reputation for rushing legislation through the House that turned out to be bad legislation.  His housing Minister criticised the previous Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on that very point on more than one occasion.  Our housing spokesperson, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, has written to the Minister asking that he urgently brief the Opposition on the proposed legislation yet the Minister has not agreed to that.

We in the Labour Party support a short-time working scheme being implemented.  I am thinking of the aviation sector in particular, which we know will be one of the last sectors to recover.

It was very clear from the commentary in that report that it did not mean for ten days.  It correctly pointed out, as part of its argument, that the huge numbers of people who have suffered income loss or job loss may have built up arrears and therefore if the ban is lifted there is a real danger that many people who have been impacted through no fault of their own by Covid-19 could find themselves facing eviction if there is not a much longer term extension of that ban.  I remind the Taoiseach that Fianna F&aacute;il supported the People Before Profit-Solidarity anti-eviction Bill in the previous D&aacute;il, which passed in the D&aacute;il.  The previous Government did not want to implement it but the Taoiseach's party voted for the Bill at that time, which sought to ban evictions on the grounds of sale to prevent vulture funds and unscrupulous landlords using eviction as a way of maximising profit at the expense of tenants.  It is clear that the NESC is alluding to that.  It also states clearly and categorically that homeless people have seen their situation improve because of public health measures such as getting own door accommodation and that those measures should not be reversed.  This is a body funded by the Taoiseach's Department.

Some other countries are in a much worse situation.  Overall, we are saying that the safest thing to do is to stay at home and take a holiday in Ireland this year.  That, to me, is fairly basic and fairly sensible.  We have a very restrictive travel regime at the moment in terms of our advice.  It is very restrictive and travel is on the floor.  The next stage is that we will be putting in place a call centre and the electronic locator form.  Contact tracing is key and there will be randomised testing at airports.  We are exploring the issue of areas where there is a high incidence of Covid-19 to see how we can further protect our citizens from any potential dangers of people travelling here from such locations and how best to deal with that, both legally and sensibly, in terms of protecting life.<\/p>  <p>  People should remember when they talk about travel from certain areas that there have been some very tough stories in terms of families who cannot get back from particular countries.  Travel is not all about tourism.  That is an important point.  In Europe, for example, they have had various advisories but they have never banned an aeroplane from landing anywhere.  Nor have we, and there is a reason for that in terms of workers, family members and so on.  We have Irish people who work in Europe and may want to get home for two or three weeks.  Some of them are working on behalf of the State.  Should our message to those workers be that when they come back, they will have to quarantine mandatorily?  They will have to restrict their movements if they are coming from countries outside the list, but we just need a bit of balance in our debate about this.  I gave figures earlier which show that travel is on the floor compared with where it was a year ago.  That does not take away the dangers of Covid-19 through travel.  I work with and talk to the acting Chief Medical Officer.  I have great respect for him and I will continue to work with him on this.

Green means go, as I said on the radio yesterday morning, and it was a political decision to give implicit permission in this regard, which is what this wording does.  The Government could have just put a list of the countries that have lower rates of infection per 100,000 people on the Government website, which has been a very good resource during this pandemic, and focused on a proper step approach to reopening travel.  In order to do that, confidence had to be given to the public, individuals and businesses.  We have not stopped aeroplanes and we are all aware of people who have had to come home for sick loved ones or people who were dying or for any reason.  We are all keenly aware of that, but we on this side of the House know there has been a step change in the Government's approach to this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish with a point on which I hope the Taoiseach will come back to me.  We need to know how many people have come back to Ireland with the virus and have gone into workplaces and so on.

After all the controversy and in circumstances where it is clear there is confusion, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, stated on a radio programme this morning that, in the context of infection, it is as safe to go to these 15 countries as it is to travel within Ireland.  How can that be tallied with the advice not to travel?  If it is so safe, why is the Government stating that people should not travel?  Why is NPHET stating that they should not travel?  The two things do not fit together.  There is a direct contradiction.  Either it is safe and people can travel or it is not safe and they should not travel.  In the context of the application of public health advice, since when has it been the case that the Government states it wishes for people to do something but they do not really have to do it?  That is the message currently coming from the Government.  When there was a 2 km restriction, the Government did not state that there was a 2 km restriction but that it did not really mind people going 3 km, 5 km or 20 km if they fancied doing so.

Despite all the hype, it boils down to individual and community behaviour.  There should not be 30 people or 60 people at a party in a house.

The public health advice in the early stages of the pandemic was not to wear masks.  There was a certain reticence regarding the usage of masks.  Having read the scientific evidence of their efficacy, I came out in favour of the usage of masks at an early stage.  Their efficacy is probably still a matter of dispute in the medical world but more and more people and bodies, including the World Health Organization, are recommending their usage.  NPHET recommended that the wearing of masks be introduced in consumer and retail spaces and that will be done.  Mandatory mask-wearing on public transport was introduced.  I pushed very hard to get that done.  I stopped the various territorial battles that were going on and stated that I wanted the regulations to be introduced.  Look what happened.

The meeting, which was the first physical meeting of European Union leaders since February, began on Friday, 17 July.  The meeting continued through the weekend and concluded in the early hours of Tuesday, 21 July.  Even leaving aside the duration, it was by no means a normal meeting.  We met against the backdrop of the Covid pandemic which has affected the economic, political and social well-being of the Continent and further afield in recent months.  That was evident in the special health and sanitary precautions that were put in place for the European Council.  It was to the forefront of the mind of every leader as we worked over the course of four days to agree to an unprecedented budgetary package to address this unprecedented collective challenge.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the unusual circumstances and the gravity of the agenda, I was glad to have an opportunity to meet my European Union counterparts for the first time since becoming Taoiseach.  As I informed the House last week, I travelled to the European Council ready to approach discussions in a constructive manner.  I was clear that I would only agree to an ambitious deal for Europe which also protected Irish interests.  I am pleased to report that in spite of sometimes very difficult negotiations, we succeeded in reaching agreement on a fair, balanced and ambitious &euro;1.8 trillion package to support Europe's economic recovery and drive the climate and digital transformation on which our future well-being and prosperity rely.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the commentary during and since the summit has dwelt on how long it took or on seemingly acrimonious exchanges between some leaders.  However, such commentary ignores or dilutes the complexity and significance of what was at stake and what was achieved.  Every seven years, when the European Union negotiates its next seven-year budget, the discussions are long and difficult.  This year, those negotiations took place against a backdrop of Brexit, which removed the United Kingdom, a former sizeable net contributor, from the equation.  Additionally and more significantly, we were attempting to craft an unprecedented and ambitious instrument to respond to a health and economic crisis on foot of a pandemic of which we did not even know a few short months ago.<\/p>  <p>  Although the focus of the meeting was predominantly on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the next generation European Union budgetary package, on Friday we also endorsed the European semester 2020 country-specific recommendations and recommendations for the euro area.  Relations between the European Union and Turkey and Russia were also raised in the course of the meeting.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will provide more details on those matters in his wrap-up remarks this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council meeting began on Friday morning with an exchange of views with Mr. David-Maria Sassoli, President of the European Parliament,.  Although most of our discussions on Friday took place in plenary meetings, from Saturday onwards the pattern of meetings varied between plenary meetings and meetings between  Mr. Charles Michel, President of the European Council, and various groupings of member states.  Ms Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, also played an important role in the discussions.  I presented Ireland's position to President Michel, including at a joint meeting that I and the Prime Ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg had with him and the President of the Commission on Sunday.  I also participated in one-to-one meetings.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, intensive discussions largely focused on five key issues: the overall amounts in the budget and recovery proposal and the distribution of funds across programmes, the balance of grants and loans, the allocation of the new recovery and resilience fund and its governance, a rule-of-law mechanism to protect the European Union budget and rebates for the highest net contributors.<\/p> <p>As the House will be aware, there were significant differences in particular between a small number of net contributor countries that took a firm position in respect of the overall size of the recovery fund and the proposed balance of grants and loans.  Those same member states were also calling for a governance framework for disbursing funds that would give the member states more oversight on whether the funds deliver the objective set out in member states' recovery and resilience plans.  A number of net beneficiaries, particularly those most affected by the Covid crisis, sought to protect the overall size of the recovery fund as proposed in the negotiating box on the table, and grant elements in particular.  There were also strongly held views around the table on the link between rule of law in member states and the operation of the Union's budget, an issue that has been pulled into sharper focus by developments in some member states in recent years.<\/p> <p> In my interventions, in addition to insisting that Ireland's concerns had to be addressed, I sought to take a constructive and positive role, working with others in support of an outcome of sufficient scale to enable member states, especially those most affected, to respond to Covid-19 and to help their economies recover.  In this I made clear my view that the package had to include a large volume of grants as well as loans.  Where member states are facing into a crisis of this dimension already burdened with significant debt, it was not appropriate in my view to offer a solution based only on making further debt available.  I was also clear that a significantly smaller budget, which some were arguing for, would not have enabled us to deliver our priorities as a Union.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and Cohesion are successful programmes that work and that are deserving of continuing support.  Similarly, in coming years the Union will need resources to enable it to undertake climate and digital transformations in a fair, balanced and just manner.  We will also need to be in a position to support those most affected by Brexit.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to report that a compromise proposal tabled by the President of the Council was ultimately accepted unanimously by the European Council.  I hope it will be helpful to Deputies if I briefly outline the key elements of the package and the significant benefits of this deal for Ireland.  In summary, the size of the recovery fund was preserved at &euro;750 billion with a balance of &euro;390 billion in grants and &euro;360 billion in loans.  A new allocation methodology was agreed, with 70% of the recovery and resilience fund committed over the next two years, and the remaining 30% allocated in 2023 based on the measured economic impact of the crisis over this year and next.  A new seven year budget of &euro;1.074 trillion was agreed with substantial funding for Cohesion, CAP, Erasmus, Horizon, migration and asylum, and the EU's neighbourhood and development instrument.  To support climate action, an ambitious target has been agreed, with 30% of spending in the budget and recovery fund to contribute to climate action, including meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement and EU climate neutrality by 2050.  A just transition fund will be established with more than double the funding originally proposed before the Covid crisis.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to report to the House that the outcome is one that fully protects Ireland's interests and that delivers on our priorities.  As I have said many times, an EU recovery is of vital importance to our own economic interests and this agreement sends a strong signal that the European Union is determined to chart the pathway to recovery together and in solidarity.  It demonstrates that Europe works for its citizens.  Ireland benefits greatly from membership of the Single Market and access to a market of more than 450 million people.  This substantial &euro;1.8 trillion package will not only help to drive recovery but it will also support the transformation of our economies in line with the climate transition, research and development, and digital agendas.  This is not only fully aligned with priorities in our programme for Government, it will open a wealth of opportunities for Irish enterprises.<\/p> <p> Like its predecessor, the Government made clear that for Ireland, maintaining a strong Common Agricultural Policy that supports our farmers, farming families and rural development was a priority.  I am pleased to inform the House that the outcome is a very good one in that regard.  The initial proposals made by the Commission just over two years ago would have reduced the proportion of the budget for CAP to just 28%.  The final agreement now sees this increased to 31%.  From an Irish perspective, I can confirm to the House that current levels of funding for Ireland have been maintained.  This includes a special allocation of &euro;300 million for Ireland in recognition of structural challenges facing our agricultural sector.  Given the very significant pressures to reduce the funding available for CAP, this is a very significant achievement.<\/p> <p> I also very much welcome the inclusion of a Brexit adjustment reserve of &euro;5 billion to address the impacts on sectors and regions most impacted by Brexit.  It is clear that for some member states the economic damage of Covid-19 will be compounded by the impact of Brexit, the real effects of which will be strongly felt from the start of next year.  Now that the special allocation has been agreed, the Government will work hard to ensure that a significant portion will be available to support Ireland and Irish enterprises.  We have already had to make significant investment in infrastructure, including customs infrastructure, as result of Brexit.  The increase to 25% in the amount of collection costs for customs duties that a member state can retain is therefore especially welcome and appropriate.  We will also receive funding under the recovery fund over the next two years, with further funding to be made available in 2023 for those most impacted economically by the crisis.  Again, we will be working to maximise Ireland's drawdown.<\/p> <p> We will also receive Structural Funds worth more than &euro;1 billion for our regions.  The &euro;120 million provision for a new PEACE PLUS programme will help to build a significant fund to further reconciliation and North-South co-operation, and continue the work of the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes in a post-Brexit context.  This is not only of real and practical benefit to those who will benefit, it is a strong and symbolic signal that the European Union will continue to stand beside the people of Northern Ireland as it has done throughout the peace process and throughout Brexit.<\/p> <p> I am also pleased to note the increased provision for Horizon under this MFF when compared with its predecessor.  The Government wants Ireland to be at the cutting edge in research and development and we will work to ensure that Departments and agencies proactively support Irish researchers, institutions and enterprises in accessing this important funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200029#BB01000","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595422800,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Brady.  The multi-annual financial framework negotiated every seven years provides member states with the opportunity to point the European Union in a new direction towards a fairer, greener and more equal Europe.  The negotiations on this budget have taken place during unprecedented times and they were lengthy.  The people of European Union, and indeed the world, are reeling from the social and economic shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The real and immediate threat of the climate emergency is reshaping our lives and challenging us to adapt and change for the sake of our planet.  In the midst of this turbulence and crisis, the negotiation of the this budget was one of those rare opportunities to kick-start real change.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, that opportunity has again been missed.  What we agreed was not a stimulus plan.  It was a package designed to impose reforms, as they are called, across the EU.  I refer to the sort of reforms that we know all too well from the time that the last Government that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was in brought the troika to town.  Linking the recovery funding to the European semester is a sure guarantee that ordinary people will again pay for the crisis just as they did the last time the Taoiseach and his party were in government.  Meanwhile, the countries that least need it secure themselves rebates, which looks like a sort of inducement to get them to agree to the final package.  In short, a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach has again signed us up to a continuation of austerity.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has gone to great lengths to sell this as a great deal for Ireland.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Try telling Irish workers and families that this is a good deal.  Under this plan, Ireland will be eligible for just 0.4% of economic recovery grants in 2021 and 2022.  That is less than half of one percent.  This is not a win for people who shouldered the pain of the last recession and who are now dealing with the economic fallout from Covid-19.  Try telling our family farmers that this is a great deal.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach has asserted, the CAP is to be cut by 9% at a time when it is never more important that it be protected.  The Taoiseach can hide behind complexity on this matter but the fact is that this is a very disappointing result for Irish agriculture.  It poses a real threat to family farms that are already under pressure.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach should try telling our rural communities that this is a great deal.  The proposed rural development recovery fund has been slashed by &euro;15 billion.  This is a huge blow to the prospects of Ireland's rural economy, to rural enterprise and to the sustainability of our towns and villages.  He should try telling those who are committed to climate action built on climate justice that this is a great deal.<\/p> <p>The just transition fund, designed to create jobs in sustainable industries and support those workers affected by changes to our economy, has been cut by &euro;20 billion.  How can the Government say it is committed to a green deal for Europe when it agrees to a budget that rows back on job creation in sustainable industries?<\/p> <p> I acknowledge and welcome the inclusion of the &euro;5 billion Brexit reserve fund for countries and sectors most affected by Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.  Much more will need to be done urgently to secure better Brexit mitigation funding.  Realistically, it a modest sum of money and it is important that the Irish Government secures a fair share of this funding in order to respond effectively to the significant economic difficulties posed by Brexit.<\/p> <p> When one digs behind the headlines one can see clearly that this is not a great deal.  Ireland is now a net contributor to the EU budget.  However, this the deal completely fails to deliver in key areas for Ireland and, as such, it is a failure on behalf of the Taoiseach.  He should have been more ambitious for Ireland.  He should have stood stronger to protect Irish Interests.  Unfortunately, he has settled for a deal that once again falls short for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200030#CC00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595423400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The European Council summit represents a major achievement for the European Union.  For a time, it seemed no agreement would be reached.  The negotiations exposed challenges faced by the EU, ones that threatened the very fabric of the Union.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently held a policy of critical engagement with the European project, deeply mindful of the benefits that Ireland accrued from its membership but critical of the bureaucratic approach that has too often brushed aside the interests and concerns of smaller states, such as Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union's primary achievement has been to prevent a major outbreak of conflict in the union since the end of World War 2.  Many observers have linked the Next Generation EU with the Marshall Plan which helped rebuild post-war Europe.  However, as was the case with the Marshall Plan, it seems Ireland will be left on the outside yet again, its face pressed against the glass looking longingly while the funds are divided out.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Byrne, stated clearly, Ireland, as one of Europe's smallest countries, which was devastated by the financial crisis caused by the Taoiseach's party the last time it was in government, and now faces the major challenges thrown at us by Brexit, will pay more into the new recovery fund than we will receive.  That is almost unbelievable.<\/p>  <p>  When I listened to the Taoiseach's remarks on the progress of the talks over the weekend I was amazed at his approach.  I found it difficult to understand the Government's willingness to acquiesce to the continuing relegation of Ireland's interests in Europe.  This country has witnessed a long line of Fianna F&aacute;il Governments which have attempted to sell the benefits of trickle-down economics.  The current Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach is trying to sell us the idea that we should pay to watch the rest of Europe progress and we will reap the rewards through a form of synergistic association with Europe's wealth.  Then I read that the Council's President, Charles Michel, said the agreement is about a lot more than money, it is about workers and families, their jobs, their health and their well-being.  Then it made sense.  Why should a Government that had repeatedly and unashamedly worked against the interests of workers and their families suddenly start giving a damn now?<\/p>  <p>  It has been agreed that approximately one third of the &euro;1.8 trillion combined EU Next Generation fund and the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, will be directed towards climate action projects, this &euro;550 billion is significantly short of the &euro;2.4 trillion required to meet EU climate targets.  <\/p>  <p>  I fear the plight of Irish farmers and their families.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has been cut by 9%.  My fear is compounded by reports that allies of the Green Party are already calling for the CAP to be aligned with the EU green deal.  It is terrifying for Irish farmers that the Green Party might be let lose on CAP.  The Government's inability to grasp the potential impact on the agricultural sector is only comparable with its disregard for the plight of ordinary workers and their families across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance reports that Ireland's EU contribution will rise to &euro;2.7 billion this year from &euro;2.4 billion last year.  This could rise again depending on the amount of non-recycled plastic waste in the country.  Would the Taoiseach consider a nationwide emergency community employment scheme to pick up empty plastic bottles?  We seem to be powerless to effect any influence on the funds that Ireland will give to the EU for Ireland to pay for Europe's recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200031#DD00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1595423400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>The general joy expressed by the principal participants at the conclusion of the European Council was not an expression of jubilation at a wonderful outcome, rather an expression of profound relief that an agreement had finally and actually been achieved.  What was at stake, as was clearly expressed within the Council, and if we believe the various news reports, by both Chancellor Merkel and President Macron was a fundamental test for the Union.  A fundamental question being asked was whether the current Union of 27 nations is still committed to the principles of mutual solidarity and mutual support or has the Brexit contagion diminished that principle to the extent that now each nation coming to any European Council must prove to a home audience that it won.  The principles that underpinned the very foundation of a European union in the aftermath of war seem to have been diminished.<\/p>  <p>  The longest summit in 20 years finally reached an agreement that was not as ambitious as we hoped for but, I must acknowledge, for the first time it was decided to mutualise borrowing and share debt within the Union.  This is a very important principle, one which Ireland would have welcomed and benefitted from during the last economic crisis the people of Ireland endured, however it was resisted.  There is still that pocket of resistance among the frugal four, or with Finland, the frugal five.  The &euro;500 billion that was in the negotiating box to be direct grants to those regions and countries most adversely impacted was substantially reduced to &euro;390 billion.<\/p> <p>Instead, in order to placate at least some of the frugal four, Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s legacy of the rebate has now been extended.  In order to get them to agree, the richer nations have had to have something back for themselves.  Ireland&rsquo;s share was never going to be massive or substantial in scale.  We understood that.  I have said many times in the debates leading up to this Council meeting that loans are of very little value to us.  We can borrow money very cheaply and we did last month at less than 0.25%.  It is direct grants that are of benefit to us.  We are now to get something like &euro;1.3 billion in 2021 and 2022.  That is obviously to be welcomed.  It will help support our own domestic economy but it will not be decisive in order to maintain a real and substantial recovery in what we need to invest in our economy in the various sectors that have been crushed under Covid -19.<\/p> <p> I wish to make one very clear point.  I heard Opposition voices make this point in the last few days which is that if we use a Tory Brexiteer formula, a zero-sum calculation, where we add up what we contribute and look to see what in cash terms we get back, and if we do not receive more cash back than we actually pay in then the Union is not working for us.  That is a disastrous calculation and is sterile and dangerous.  It ignores the importance of the Single Market for the health and well-being of our economy.  We need our trading partners to be strong and we need a healthy market to exist.  We export more per capita than virtually any other country on the globe.  We have left behind us the isolationism which characterised the early decades of our State and we look now to trade our goods and services to add value.  Access to sustainable markets is a critical component of that.  If our trading partners are not in a healthy state, that impacts greatly on us.<\/p> <p> I will make some comments now on the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, discussions.  Seven years ago I was involved in those discussions and I know how torturous and convoluted they can be.  There are added complications this time which I acknowledge.  One tries to negotiate, where a great amount of deals are done by eyeballing people, taking people aside, and having words in people&rsquo;s ears.  That has been made extremely difficult over the last number of months.  I also acknowledge the fact that the UK, a substantial net contributor, is no longer part of the calculation.  We really need to have an open discussion on whether we want to be ambitious for the future of Europe.  It seems now that the prevailing argument has won, where the populism of diminishing the capacity of the Union to act with mutual support is the dominant view within the European Union, which I regret.  We were not ambitious in what we can do on both the green agenda of transforming our economies and in using the resources that we collectively have to make an extraordinary and substantial advance.  Some things are good but it is not as ambitious as it could have been.  <\/p> <p> We will have opportunities in the future to talk about the impact on agriculture, on pillar 1 and pillar 2 funding.  I want to acknowledge the continuation of the PEACE PLUS programme funding that was hard fought for the last time, which I thought might be the last iteration of that.  It is very welcome.  What is not welcome is a reduction of health preparedness within Europe for the next pandemic or crisis that will arise, or for the amount of resources available for climate transition.  As I said earlier we will have other opportunities to get back to discuss that.<\/p> <p> In my remaining time I will mention two further points.  One is the Brexit reserve fund which is something we can look to.  I am not so sure of some of the language but it has been talked about consistently as being in the region of &euro;5 billion.  The Taoiseach in one of his interviews said up to &euro;5 billion.  Can I ask how much will be in this fund?  When will it be accessible and what are the criteria for drawing it down?  That is to be used as the victory for Ireland, if there is to be one, that that support is there for us.<\/p> <p> My final point is on the paying for the mutualised debt.  I am very strongly in favour of using the common strength of the Union and to deploy it where it is most needed.  The principles of cohesion - I negotiated the last cohesion round of funding in the last MFF - is of great importance and gives hope to people to draw everybody up to the highest level of income within the European Union and we need to be much more ambitious in that.  From anything I have read from the summit conclusions or the aftermath, we are not clear as to how this is to be paid for.  There were discussions on different types of taxation across the Union and a substantial willingness for a plastic tax of some sort that was not exactly specified, and a less clear attitude towards a digital tax.  This is worthy of discussion and I would not be so dismissive of it.  This needs to be on a worldwide, or OECD basis, at least.  We should have an upfront discussion on these matters.  If we have an ongoing capacity to borrow significantly within the European Union we can tackle some of the gross inequalities that have alienated more and more of the European peoples from the European concept and allowed those who want to exploit that alienation and that genuine concern for inequality in order to break up the Union.  That is something that all of us should seek to resist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200031#DD00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595424000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Howlin.

It is that type of politics that really fed into what happened in the UK with Brexit.  If we bring that type of politics to its ultimate conclusion it will lead to the breakup of the European Union.  That type of politics has been articulated quite strongly by some of the voices here in the Chamber today.  On the other hand there is a vision of the European Union as a project for the common good.  It is all to play for as to which direction we go for.  Much of the negotiations at the weekend were inconclusive.  Both positives and negatives have come out of it which I will go through shortly.  <\/p>  <p>  Fundamental to this is an understanding of us, our economy and how it works.  If one understands Ireland as a small open economy that is reliant on exports and on the economic well-being and health of other European countries, then there is no question but that the European Union project built on the common good is very much in our narrow economic interests as well as in the interests of everyone else in Europe.  <\/p>  <p> We have had in the last number of years - we also see this going back to the last crisis - a kind of punitive approach taken by many northern European countries with stronger economies and public services where they blame some of the weaker economies in the European Union.  One can see this sort of blame game within these negotiations, where the fault is attributed to countries who have had a greater Covid-19 crisis, have weaker public services, or whose economies are not as strong, rather than taking the view of that these countries need more support to create a level playing field in the European Union which would benefit everyone.  This is fundamentally what is in question here.  There is no doubt at all that while there are some shortcomings, and I have misgivings about the deal and how much it has delivered, there is also no doubt that having the mutualised debt is a significant victory for everyone who believes in the European Union as a common project.  If mutualised and shared debt had been in place ten years ago the economic recovery across Europe would have been much faster.<\/p> <p>It would have given us a much stronger basis for resisting austerity policies that affected a number of countries.  That is significant and should be noted.  The adoption of an EU-wide tax on non-recyclable plastic is to be welcomed, as is the agreement that the Commission will look at other proposals such as a digital levy, carbon border adjustments, emissions trading schemes and proposals on financial transactions tax.<\/p> <p> This deal was initially going to be &euro;500 billion in grants, as put forward by Germany and France.  It rowed back to &euro;400 billion with an element of loans, then down to just &euro;390 billion in grants.  That initial &euro;500 billion proposed by Germany and France was a proposal brought forward in the context of what had happened in response to the Covid crisis in Europe.  I remind the House that what happened on 28 February is that Italy sent a request for face masks to the EU's emergency response co-ordination centre and did not get any response to that request.  After that, both Germany and France actively blocked the export of protective medical equipment that was needed in Italy.  The free movement of goods in the Single Market was effectively suspended at that point and, in addition, France seized 6 million masks, including masks destined for Italy and Spain.  When Italy ordered additional masks that were brought by ship to the port in Marseilles, France subsequently started to seize those masks which meant that the ship had to flee the port in Marseilles and turn to Brussels to deliver its cargo safely.  In that context, France and Germany correctly realised that they were putting the future of the European Union in jeopardy and correctly came up with the proposals for grants.<\/p> <p> Damage has been done to the proposals by the so-called frugal five, or as a professor of politics in UCD called them, the stingy five.  That initial proposal has been watered down.  We see in the proposals agreed that there were cuts from the initial text to health, research and the just transition fund.  Just transition should be at the core of everything we do.  More than that, we should ensure that any funding and projects coming from the European Union are climate-proofed, not just the funding dedicated to climate.  We should not be funding some projects on one hand and then effectively counteracting them in other areas.  Research by Greenpeace has shown that much funding at European Union and European Government level continues to go into toxic and polluting industries.  We need to make sure our approach is consistent.<\/p> <p> With respect to Ireland being a net contributor and what it is putting in and getting out of this, we have to accept and realise that, with regard to GDP calculations, we are in a situation that is not favourable to us.  Ireland will receive one of the lowest shares of funds, partially because of our inflated GDP and how that is measured.  The European Commission's formula relies on that GDP, which does not properly reflect our national economic activity.  That is a downside of the policies that Ireland has for corporation tax and attracting foreign direct investment, since it distorts our GDP, so we should be aware of that when discussing these things.<\/p> <p> With regard to rule of law, I note the Taoiseach made some comments but did not go into detail about Ireland's position on this.  It is welcome that the courts in Poland have struck out the idea of so-called LGBT-free zones that were in place in a third of municipalities.  That is welcome.  I raised it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade before.  We have to recognise that there is an ongoing attack against the media, judiciary, the trans community in Hungary and against civil society organisations.  This cannot and should not be tolerated in the European Union.  We must stand up for democracy and human rights across the globe, but first and foremost at home in the European Union.  As net contributors to the European Union, we have to realise that our money will now go into countries with questionable records and practices.  The fudge that has arisen from the Council negotiations, where proposals are to be brought forward on how to deal with this on a qualified majority voting basis, really kicks this down the line.  I call on the Taoiseach to push this as much as he can at further meetings and make sure that Ireland stands strong on this.  It is great that the Government can be strong on issues related to minority rights in Ireland but we need that same vocal stance to be taken at a European Union level.  I call on the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to take that stand.<\/p> <p> The issue of tax avoidance is not going to go away at a European Union level, notwithstanding the recent decision on Apple tax.  It is essential that all corporations and businesses, whether large or small, pay a fair share of taxation.  If we are serious about our international representation, Ireland should stop blocking proposals for country-by-country reporting on tax arrangements at a European Union level.  If that measure is brought in, it will allow for much greater transparency and ensure that no member state is effectively able to cheat other states out of their fair share of tax.  We cannot have it both ways.  The Taoiseach has rightly said that we need to have a level playing field in Europe and that what is good for the European economy is good for Ireland as a net exporter.  The same goes for tax fairness and tax justice.  We must have tax justice and tax fairness across the European Union if we are going to have a level playing field and a strong future for the European Union project.<\/p> <p> I endorse the view that we should not be taking a view of national self-interest on this.  We should take a European Union-wide view.  That is in our interests as well as the interests of all other peoples and member states in the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200032#EE00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595424600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.  I think the references to the frugal four or five, or even the stingy four or five, are too kind.  These people are the hawks of austerity and neoliberalism.  The fact that these hawks of neoliberalism and austerity have won a significant battle is indicated by the EU4Health budget, which was initially projected as being more than &euro;9 billion, while after the negotiations concluded, it had been reduced to just over &euro;1 billion.  This EU4Health project was supposed to be the big response to Covid-19.  The people who pushed for that and allowed that budget for health and the need for a dramatic response across Europe to a global health pandemic to be axed to almost nothing makes it clear that the people who run Europe have learned nothing from the pandemic that continues to grip Europe and threaten Europe and the world.  They have learned less than nothing in deciding to axe that budget.  That budget was for stockpiles of things such as ventilators, investing in and resourcing public health services across Europe and for early warning systems for pandemics.  There was a brief moment in which they realised that we should change in response to Covid and then it was axed in favour of loans.<\/p>  <p>  What is the difference between loans and grants?  Loans are about us financing the recovery of Europe by borrowing from rich people and allowing rich people to profit from those loans.  That is what borrowing is.  Sometimes we imagine that borrowing is some sort of abstract activity.  It is really borrowing from already rich people and paying them interest.  The alternative is direct funding, funded by progressive taxation where the rich people pay some additional tax, perhaps a digital tax or a financial transaction tax, and we use that money to invest in things like health, housing, infrastructure, educational capacity and childcare.<\/p> <p>That is the difference between loans and grants.<\/p> <p> It is clear that the neoliberal hawks who favour austerity and who want to disarm us in the face of a global pandemic - they did it before with ten years of austerity - have won out.  Our Government's claims to object to that agenda are completely undermined by the fact that we are the worst foot draggers when it comes to actually imposing taxes on these very wealthy interests that constantly avoid tax.  We are the ones blocking and opposing digital taxes, we are the ones who do not want a financial transaction tax and we are the ones who act as a tax haven for some of the biggest tax avoiders and the most wealthy corporations in the world.  Ireland's concern about the frugal five of austerity hawks is hollow in the extreme.<\/p> <p> This is terribly important because all of it reflects on our July stimulus and what is coming up.  All the discussion is about the stimulation of business.  Do not get me wrong.  A total of 1 million people depend on small and medium businesses for employment and we must absolutely protect and sustain those jobs.  Why, however, do we not understand that investing in health, education, childcare and infrastructure is not just urgently required to deal with the post-Covid-19 world, it is a stimulus in itself?  It is the basis of a sustainable and transformed economy in the post-Covid-19 world.  It was needed for Covid-19 but now it is absolutely a matter of urgency to invest in a healthcare system, which means recruiting people so we can deal with Covid-19, to resource our education system, which is desperately overcrowded, to have a childcare system that works and to have a nursing home sector that works.  This is a good thing for society and also an economic stimulus that is far more sustainable and which would move us to a more sustainable economic and social model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200033#FF00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595425200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I note that the Taoiseach is following his predecessor in leaving the Chamber before Solidarity-People Before Profit speaks on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200034#GG00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1595425200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>To clarify, the Taoiseach had to leave.

We await the next European Council statements because this happened on every occasion with the previous Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  There exist two dominant narratives about the outcome of this European Council.  The first is that of the establishment of the European Union, and echoed very much by the Taoiseach here today, where this is a victory for European solidarity.  On the other hand, we have the more blunt and, in reality, more honest narrative from, among others, the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, who stated: \"We're here because everyone is taking care of their own country.\"  So, no hint of a spirit of European solidarity from him or, if the reports are to be believed, from many others at the negotiating table.  Fundamentally, at the negotiating table they are representing the interests of big business in their own countries.<\/p>  <p>  If one looks beyond the rhetoric and behind the top-line figures, what does one find?  There are &euro;360 billion worth of grants and &euro;390 billion worth of loans.  The point has been made that for many people in many countries the loans are not worth very much.  Let us examine the grants.  There is, obviously, a real concession in the fact that European-wide borrowing is taking place and there is disbursement of grants.  At the same time as making that concession in respect of the crisis, the establishment across the European Union, the Commission and the Governments that make up the European Council, have taken advantage of the crisis to go further in establishing what is referred to conditionality.  In order to get this grant money, a business will need to meet the country-specific recommendations.  Again, the EU is using the shock of the crisis as a kind of shock doctrine to reinforce the power of the European Commission to demand structural reforms.  The latter will not be reforms that benefit ordinary people or improve public services in the coming years, they will be reforms of a neoliberal and austerity-driven character.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement states that member states shall prepare national recovery and resilience plans that will be reviewed and adapted.  It also states: \"The recovery and resilience plans shall be assessed by the Commission within two months of the submission.  The criteria of consistency with the country-specific recommendations ... shall need the highest score of the assessment.\"  It further states that they will have to be approved by the Council, etc.  The agreement is being used to reinforce the power of country-specific recommendations that have up to now been used to demand labour market reform in a negative way for workers, to demand privatisation and to demand liberalisation.<\/p>  <p>  The other telling point about the nature of the agreement is the way in which the countries with far-right and dictatorial Governments, such as Poland and Hungary, were treated.  Their Governments subvert any form of democracy at home.  Hungary has effectively suspended democracy and replaced it with semi-fascistic and dictatorial one-man rule by decree.  The European Union has, effectively, attached no conditions to the funds they will receive.  Instead, those at the negotiating table, including the Irish Government, gave them huge concessions.  Poland, which is a major polluter, has essentially received an exemption from emissions targets as part of this deal, no longer needing to reach the already unambitious and inadequate target of net zero emissions by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Look at what else was lost in the process of negotiation.  The point has already been made by Deputy Boyd Barrett about health spending being taken away altogether.  The original Commission proposal contained &euro;30 billion for a just transition fund.  This has been cut by two thirds, or &euro;20 billion, to &euro;10 billion.  This gives a real vision of what the priorities are for those who rule across the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  We need a socialist green new deal on a European level.  We cannot go from the Covid-19 crisis into the impending climate catastrophe we are facing.  This is not just about using the language of a green new deal, as the Government and the European Union leaders do.  Instead it is about a radical transformation of our society to put people's needs and our planet, instead of profit, at the centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200034#GG00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1595425200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the European Council's conclusions.  In the seven pages of the conclusions that focus on the CAP, there are nine references to climate and climate change and one to food.  This shows the change in focus at European level with regard to food.  In fact, there was no reference whatsoever to the issue of food security.  Surely, in the context of what we have seen in recent months with Covid-19, and because the primary focus of the Council meeting was Covid-19, the issue of food security would have come up.  Right across Europe we have seen panic buying and supermarket shelves left empty.  In Ireland, we have seen how protecting food supplies has impacted on levels of Covid-19 in our meat plants, and yet the issue of food security is not referenced in any of the Council documents.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner on Environment, Oceans and Fisheries recently told a meeting of the European Parliament's agriculture committee that food security is no longer a major concern for the European Union.  The Commissioner went on to say that other challenges are dominating the European food system, such as food waste, over-consumption, obesity and the food system's overall environmental footprint.  We need to reassess the issue of food security in the context of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>The concept of food security is no longer an abstract consideration but a real issue.  Both food security and resilience need to be embedded in our key objectives with regard to the CAP as well as securing and enhancing farming in its wider context of the economy, along with the social, cultural and environmental well-being of communities throughout the country.<\/p> <p> Earlier the Taoiseach spoke about the overall reduction in the CAP budget as not being as severe as initially projected.  However, we are looking, even at constant values, at a &euro;39,000 million cut over the seven years of the budget.  This does not take into consideration inflation over the past seven years.  I accept it was a significant challenge to the Government, particularly in the context of not being able to have bilateral meetings because of Covid-19.  However, the impact of these cuts will be a challenge for communities throughout the country and the agricultural sector in particular.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the special allocation of &euro;300 million in recognition of the structural challenges we face in Ireland.  I spoke about that when the new agriculture Minister was appointed last week.  I hope we will see investment in a farm retirement scheme to encourage farmers to hand over the land to younger farmers, especially in the livestock and suckler sector where such a scheme is urgently needed.<\/p> <p> In the context of climate, we are asleep at the wheel in terms of putting our best foot forward.  Our own climate action plan sets out a target for reducing agricultural emissions by 10% between 2017 and 2030.  Based on our current suckler cow numbers, emission reductions of close to 10% have already been achieved between 2018 and 2019 alone.  While we have achieved that 13-year target in just 24 months, albeit for the wrong reasons, and while it may help to meet our national climate targets, in a perverse way it will do more damage to the planet in terms of global warming.  That is because we count climate emissions based on the country where the food is produced, not on where that food is actually consumed.  Even though 90% of our beef is exported, Ireland is penalised for being the most carbon-efficient beef exporter in the European Union because the rules state that responsibility is on the producer rather than the consumer of that food product.  Relatively carbon-efficient beef production in Ireland can therefore be replaced throughout the European Union with beef from the Amazon basin that is 35 times worse from an environmental perspective.  That is okay according to the climate mathematicians.  It is not okay, however, for our atmosphere.<\/p> <p> We have a CAP which regulates food production in member states except when it comes to climate emissions when there is a national cap, not an EU-wide one.  This completely undermines carbon-efficient food production in favour of cheap food, regardless of its climate impact and from where it comes.  We need an EU-wide methane cap for agriculture which supports carbon-efficient beef production in Ireland and which is good at reducing global climate emissions.  It needs to support grass-fed beef on low intensity agriculture such as that produced in Ireland which has a lower negative impact on soil erosion, biodiversity and nutrient leaching than other beef production models.  This is another fact conveniently ignored by those who focus on farming being purely a climate problem.  Grass-based systems on disadvantaged land types in much of Ireland, removing carbon from the atmosphere, and converting it, by producing beef, into a human protein on land that is not suitable for tillage crops is again being ignored in terms of the type of agricultural model we have here.  That does not mean that agriculture and farming should get a free pass.  The fact is that managing our land use better can take more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere while reducing harmful effects on climate and oceans far quicker than just shutting down agriculture itself.<\/p> <p> I find it disappointing that we have all these references to climate in the communiqu&eacute; from the European Commission.  We have a new Government in place which is talking about the need for more climate-orientated agriculture.  We have a CAP focused on that.  However, in last year's budget, the Minister for Finance allocated &euro;3 million to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to pilot new agri-environmental schemes to fulfil our climate action objectives in 2020.  Yet the Department told me last week that it is only developing those plans.  It will soon be August 2020 but the Department is only considering what it is doing.  Clearly, it is planning to launch this initiative at the ploughing championships.  Somebody forgot to tell the Department there will be no ploughing championships this year.  It looks like we will have to have to wait until September 2021 until we get this initiative.  We need to see movement on environmental schemes that are farmer-orientated and implemented in a practical manner by farmers now, not next year or the year after that.<\/p> <p> I welcome the proposal to introduce an EU-wide tax on non-recyclable plastic.  As an environment Minister at European Council level, I advocated on behalf of this.  However, the officials in Merrion Street were opposed to it.  They felt that if we advocated such a tax across Europe on non-recyclable plastic, which we need to eradicate quickly, then it would undermine our opposition to a digital tax.  I do not think it undermines that argument.  Ireland should be to the fore in Europe in reducing non-recyclable plastic, particularly in light of the fact that Ireland is one of the largest generators of non-recyclable plastic at domestic level.  We need to drive that particular agenda forward quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200034#GG00500","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595425800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Nolan and O'Donoghue.<\/p>  <p>  C&aacute; bhfuil an Taoiseach?

It is obvious, however, that we did not come out well from it.  The Taoiseach stated the package will stand Europe in good stead in the future.  Good man.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, said it is true that we will pay more than we will receive and it is difficult to estimate how much we will contribute.  However, it will be substantial.  If I came home from the mart and told the wife that I sold the cattle but did not know for how much, I would not only be laughed at but told I was not going again.<\/p>  <p>  While the figures are hard to find, German media have reported the figures on the EU budget for the next seven years.  It lists Ireland as the fifth highest contributor to the EU with a net contribution of &euro;15.7 billion over the next seven years.  That is pretty stark.  Only four countries, Germany, France, Holland and Sweden, are to contribute more than us.  Our contribution as a percentage of GDP makes us the second highest contributor for every man woman and child in this State, only ahead of Luxembourg.<\/p>  <p>  Over the weekend, there were many criticisms of the frugal four countries.  They were right and stood up to fight for themselves.  We are the good boys in Europe, however.  We are the lackeys who accept everything and nod.<\/p> <p>They got major write-downs in respect of what they were supposed to pay and we got nothing.  For being the good boy in class, we probably got sweets.  My goodness.  Of the top five contributors, three - Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden - received significant write-downs on their contributions because they are frugal countries.  They kicked up and rattled the cage.  When we go to Europe, our duty is to rattle the cage and to fight for Ireland, not to adore the prima donnas of the European project and be told how good we are and how strong our economy is.  It is bluff and bluster.  Ask those who are on the dole or homeless.  Ask the farmers who are struggling.  CAP will be decimated too.<\/p> <p> I will not be all negative.  There have been good things.  Earlier, the Taoiseach told me about all the money we got from Europe over the past 40 years.  We did, but that is like talking about the choc ice we had at lunch yesterday or the dinner we had an hour ago.  It is gone and done.  It is the future that I am worried about.  We were crippled by the so-called bailout.  It was not a bailout, it was a total clean-out.  We knew there was no solidarity then.  They kicked us in the teeth and we lay down.  We are still lying down and accepting what we get.<\/p> <p> The European project is in choppy waters.  Anyone watching can see that.  The big countries fight for their rights if they do not want to do something.  They got write-downs.  Every man, woman and child in Ireland will repay contributions of &euro;3,201, which is almost twice as much as people in Germany will pay and three times what the French, who will only contribute &euro;780 each, will pay.

That is deeply insulting and does not bode well for the sense of solidarity being maintained.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has welcomed the retention of the significant funding to protect CAP, but we need to see the detail of that.  The Council's February proposal introduced a number of increased flexibility measures in the areas of cohesion and agriculture.  In view of the effects of Covid-19, a second flexibility package is being added.  This relates to the implementation rules under the cohesion policy and CAP, as well as the concentration of European rural development supports.  This must happen as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  We must see an end to what the president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association recently called the constant erosion and devaluation of payments.  He has correctly noted that there has also been a relentless downward pressure on direct payments to farmers, which has disadvantaged Ireland disproportionately.

I hope that this matter is being examined by our MEPs in addition to what is required to meet the Covid pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  As I highlighted previously, it is essential that our pharmaceutical companies be consulted.  They are fundamental in our fight against the coronavirus.  The EU is prepared to fund the projects.  It is essential that we in Ireland get our fair share of funding, but it is most essential that our MEPs fight for us in Europe.  The farming sector, hoteliers, etc., want to get their businesses back up and running, but we cannot do that unless we have cheap funding.  The ideal would be an interest rate of 0%, but even if Ireland got that rate, the money would still have to be paid back.

I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister of State on whatever part they played in it.<\/p>  <p>  There are many different views in the House about the budget, and there is a kernel of truth in each of them.  The budget is not enough, but it is never enough.  I would prefer to have seen more grants and fewer loans, but we must remember that we, as citizens of Ireland, are underwriting those loans.  Some programmes have been cut and others have received extra resources, including the very welcome &euro;5 billion Brexit fund.  At the end of the day, though, what matters is the overall balance and the not insignificant point that 27 member states, represented by 27 different Heads of State and Government with one eye on Europe and another on their own countries, actually managed to agree a &euro;1.82 trillion fund.  Crucially, for the first time ever, the member states of the EU have demonstrated solidarity by borrowing together and spending mutualised debt.  When people speak of an historic outcome, they are, in fact, correct.<\/p>  <p>  One of the benefits of the &euro;750 billion fund is that the European Commission can borrow money ultra cheaply in light of its triple A+ rating.  Some member states have ratings as low as triple B-, but because the European Commission can borrow so cheaply, we can all access the money at that rate.  This is an important point.  It is often seen as a side benefit, but it matters.<\/p> <p>I also want to highlight that the EU budget, big and all that it is, is somewhere between 1% and 2% of what all 27 member states spend nationally each year.  It is important but its rationale is that it adds value.  What we contribute and what we get back is important but if that is all there is then we should keep our own money and spend it.  The budget is not a pass the parcel of money around Europe.  We invest in the European budget so that we have a Single Market, the free movement of people, goods and services and so that we work together be it on health research, a digital single market or on supporting farmers to produce safe, quality, traceable food.<\/p> <p> In the final analysis what most people really care about is how the money is spent.  We will discuss and debate that over the coming months and year in this House but I would like to flag a few important issues now.  The Taoiseach said that the CAP budget had increased from 28% to 31%, which is true but it still represents a 9% cut which is significant.  There is an additional &euro;300 million and that is welcome but it is crucial that the co-funding risks for Pillar 2 are increased so that our rural development funds can help to support family farms.  That is a decision that we take in this country.  I agree with the proposals on convergence.  As I said previously to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I want to see that convergence continuing during the transition period.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach spoke about &euro;1 billion for the regions, which is good but the regional assemblies must be the decision-makers.  They cannot be a mere conduit for funds.  The final point I want to make has been made by other speakers.  There is conditionality attached to this money with its link to the European semester.  I had a quick look at the country specific recommendations for Ireland for 2019 and 2020 because they represent our obligations under the semester.  One of the four recommendations last year and this year is that we broaden our tax base.  While recommendations are not written in stone they clearly point the direction of travel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200036#JJ01900","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595427000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Much has been made of the reduction in funding and Ireland will not get as much out of it as people believe it should get.  There is a sense of solidarity and a need for countries to benefit more.  If we are doing well we should contribute more and take less of the benefits across the board.  However, the question is whether we are doing better.  Are we doing well in that context?<\/p>  <p>  In terms of our recent history in Europe and how it has treated us, at the time of the bank bailout here Europe insisted that we repay the debts of its banks.  There is much talk about the frugal countries that are controlling Europe insisting that they get a payback from Europe.  It was their banks that gave the money to us that funded the crisis here.  When everything went wallop we had to pay them back.  The benefit for everybody does not appear to exist.  It appears that Europe decides what happens and we go along with it.  The biggest problem that we face in Ireland is that we are not willing to force our own view on the discussion or we are just willing to sit back and take whatever we get.  From what I can see, everything that has developed in regard to Europe is based on what France and Germany think or on what the frugal states such as Holland and so on think.  It does not appear that what Ireland thinks or its views in relation to the European discussion are important.  That is a problem.<\/p>  <p>  On the CAP, the Taoiseach said that the CAP funding has been maintained but maintaining it is not good enough.  It is actually a reduction because maintaining it means it has not been index linked.  This will become evident over the coming years.  It will have a huge impact across the board.  The reason the CAP is under pressure is not because of Brexit and the British leaving the European Union, as has been put out by the Government for a long time, rather it is because of the European Union's interests in development in terms of a military structure and European defence.  This is evident in terms of the delivery of budgets here over the last while as well.  The EU is seeking to have more effective control over the EU borders and increasing external action.  We wonder what does this actually mean in terms of Europe.  What this means for us should be elaborated on and discussed more in this House.  The Government's response will be that we are opting out and not involving our armed forces but it is being done in our names.  As far as I know we are still members of the European Union regardless of whether we actually send troops to fight on behalf of it.  We are still members of the EU and we benefit from it.<\/p>  <p>  Reference is made in the statement to the TEN-T networks.  We hear a lot of TEN-T in the western parts of Ireland.  In terms of Donegal, we see TEN-T networks from Donegal town up through the county as far as Derry.  I note that &euro;1.5 billion of the TEN-T networks will go towards military mobility needs.  Basically, the road network is being strengthened and upgraded to ensure it can carry tanks to the border to further European needs.  I am not suggesting that is happening in Ireland but it is happening across the rest of Europe.  This is the type of areas we are putting money into.  We should be very wary of this and we should be having our views heard in that regard at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200037#KK00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1595427000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>It appears to me that the Taoiseach went to Brussels and his intention was to agree whatever transpired regardless of the cost.  The big losers in the deal announced are farmers and rural communities not just in Ireland but across the European Union.  I found the Taoiseach's defence of what is a 9% cut in the Common Agricultural Policy budget pathetic.  To suggest that the overall CAP budget increased from 29% in the Commission's proposal to 31% in the final deal and to try to sell that as some form of victory is bizarre considering that in the last multiannual financial framework, MFF, CAP funding, as a proportion of the overall budget, was 37%.  Even on the Taoiseach's new parameters it has never been used because if it had been then every MFF negotiation that an Irish Government has been involved in since the 1980s would have been considered an abysmal failure considering at that point the CAP made up about 75% of the overall budget.<\/p>  <p>  Our farmers are terrified as not only are they facing this cut, they are facing the prospect of 40% of all funding being reliant on some unknown climate criteria.  We do not know if this will be beneficial or if it will result in additional bureaucracy and costs.  Rural communities are faced with a possible &euro;7.5 billion reduction in rural development funding.  All the while, they are being told to wait for a potential Brexit relief fund.  It should be remembered that if we need to draw down Brexit relief funding it means we are in deep trouble.  Arguably, even if we were to get the full &euro;5 billion that is being allocated across the European Union for that emergency fund, it would not make up the damage that would be done to our economy or our farm network.<\/p> <p>The big question that needs to be asked, particularly of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Deputies who are trying to laud this deal, is whether they will stand for what has been a sell-out of our rural communities and for what has been a decimation of our family farm network.  The Taoiseach may have rubbished this when I put it to him yesterday, but family farmers are operating in Ireland today which will not be operating in five years' time as a result of this budget.

The outcome of these EU negotiations is a perfect example of that.  In the midst of a global pandemic, when so many people are suffering here, the Government has gone to Europe and seemingly agreed that Ireland will pay more into the EU budget and get less in return.  It is those who rely so much on funding from Europe who will suffer most, namely, farmers and rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  Just two months ago, Commissioner Phil Hogan made great fanfare of how valuable the recovery fund will be for Ireland, with an additional &euro;354 million in Ireland's rural development envelope.  That fund has now been halved, which means that Ireland will be robbed of about &euro;177 million in funding.  Many rural communities did not recover after the previous economic collapse, not to mention the blow caused to them by Covid-19.  Now, when they need more support, the Government has gone to Europe and come home with less.  That is simply not acceptable to rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Taoiseach earlier during Questions on Promised Legislation when he spoke about the benefits of Ireland's membership of the EU, such as the job creation and the services that it has brought us.  In counties such as Roscommon and Galway, however, and throughout the wider western region, we do not see that job creation or those services.  It is not Europe that I blame for that; it is the Government here.  It is Governments here that have continuously discriminated against the western and north-western region.  That was the conclusion of the EU Commission in 2019 when it classed the west and the north west of Ireland as a region in decline, a region not progressing but regressing at a rapid rate.  I lay that firmly at the feet of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Giving us a Minister in the west eventually will not cut it.  We need urgent and major investment in the west and north-western region and throughout rural towns and villages.

Ireland is one of the most heavily indebted nations on the planet.  We currently have a higher debt <i>per capita<\/i>than Greece.  Our debt is well north of &euro;200 billion, and after the next five years of the Covid-19 crisis, it is likely that will be added to significantly.  It shocks me that these types of major decisions made in the EU are continuously made on the basis of our GDP figures.  These are leprechaun figures, which grossly overestimate the level of wealth that exists in the State.  In real terms we should be looking at debt <i>per capita<\/i>or the debt-to-GNI ratio.  On both metrics, Ireland is, in international and historical terms, massively indebted.<\/p><p>This is the context of the negotiations that have happened within the EU.  The EU, historically, has been no friend to Ireland.  During the bank crisis, it did enormous damage to Ireland.  It forced a debt onto this country under terms that no other country was forced to endure.  As a result, there is a massive legacy debt in this country and this debt is no small matter.  It has an opportunity cost every day.  The interest we are paying on that debt comes out of housing, healthcare, transport and infrastructure.<\/p><p>It is, on one level, incredible that the Taoiseach is not here, while the relevant Minister of State who is here is texting away.  On the radio yesterday when that Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, was asked how much this deal would cost Ireland, he shrugged and said he did not know, as if his new role included the responsibility of signing a blank cheque.  The cost of this deal, which Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party signed up to, will have a larger effect on Ireland than on any other European country.  Irish citizens, <i>per capita<\/i>, will pay more than citizens in every other European country except Luxembourg.  In the context of the debt mountain we are sitting on and the fact that we are on the precipice of a serious economic shock over the next number of years, for a Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or Green Party Government to go to Europe and to cost each citizen in the State roughly &euro;3,500 is incredible.<\/p><p>I was listening to some of the Opposition voices in the House, such as the Social Democrats and the Labour Party, and the naivety with which they talk about this magical European solidarity that is said to exist within Europe.

The <i>realpolitik<\/i>that exists in the EU is national self-interest.  Until this country cops itself on with regard to the national self-interest, we will always be tipping the cap and in the ha'penny place relative to the rest of the EU when it comes to these types of negotiations.  The decision the Taoiseach made in recent days has cost this country dearly, but that is not out of character for him.  The previous time that he was a member of the Cabinet, his decisions cost this country dearly and we are still paying for them.  Sometimes it seems that in such discussions, if a person criticises the EU, he or she is some kind of quasi-Brexiteer, but that is rubbish too.  One can criticise the bad, poor and weak decisions that the Government makes when it comes to the EU and still support a partnership of democratic countries throughout the EU working together for mutual self-interest and for stronger economies.  It is not the case that if one opposes the EU as it exists, one is a Brexiteer.  Another type of Europe exists.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we do not now have time to discuss what is happening to farmers and rural Ireland.

How is this seen as a good deal?  Rural Ireland and farmers in particular have in the past number of years suffered severely because of very bad deals being done and we are now looking at a further cut in forthcoming budgets that will mainly affect Irish agriculture.  I need to know how this can be seen as a good deal.  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, might explain it.<\/p>  <p>  How will this affect the suckler or beef farmer who has struggled over the past number of years?  How will it affect the dairy sector, sheep and pig farmers?  All farming sectors have been hit very hard and the people involved have serious worries.  We need answers today.<\/p>  <p>  Fishermen in this country have also been hit badly and they are the forgotten people in Irish politics.  I spoke at length during Government formation discussions about how there should be a Minister with responsibility for fisheries but that has not happened.  People involved with fishing are in the back seat of society and the sector has been feeling the effects badly.  These people are forgotten in any compensation packages we have seen to date.  This goes for inshore fishermen as well as the men on the trawlers fighting for their livelihoods and having to worry about Brexit around the corner, which may lead to us and every other European trawler being kicked out of British waters.  They will come to the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte waters that have been there off Ireland for decades, and there has never been a political fight for them.<\/p>  <p>  I hope our tourism sector was protected with this deal.  We still have a VAT rate of 13.5% and I again call for the rate to be reduced, if not to zero, to 5%.  Some Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies looked for the zero rate but are now seeking the 5% rate.  We need that deal.  The rate is 23% in some cases.  The publicans are on their knees.  The Government closed the doors of many rural pubs last week with the terrible decision to throw such businesses in with the nightclubs.  It was a disgraceful decision because common sense indicates the two sectors should have been separated.<\/p>  <p>  It seems to be okay to allow airlines to bring people to the country without any controls.  I have maintained all along that we need same-day testing with results at our airports.  We could have it but the Government has refused to carry it out, saying it amounts to 75% to 80% proof of a person having the virus.  No proof is required today as the doors are open and people can come in.  The poor publican with five or ten customers had to keep his doors shut.  The Government is kidding the nation and people are copping on to this very quickly.  They are angry.  Will the Government drop the 23% VAT rate on alcohol to at least 5% in order to give those publicans some chance of survival in the weeks ahead?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200039#MM00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1595428200,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I will ask one or two questions of the Minister of State.  I have already said what I had to say.  I ask him about the 9% cut to the CAP.  As I stated earlier, it is a major concern.  The Taoiseach spoke about the extra &euro;300 million and that we have the Brexit fund but that is a one-off.  We have absolutely no idea how much money we will get from that.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State about rural development payments.  Farmers are supposed to meet environmental and climate targets but all they see are cuts to rural development funding.  They have a biodiversity strategy with which they must comply, along with the green deal.  They will incur significant extra costs and bureaucracy.  How does the Minister of State see this working?  The Government can significantly up the level of co-funding in Pillar 2 payments.  We have not done that before and instead we have cut them back.  I am not asking the Minister of State today what level or rate the co-funding rates will be increased to but I am asking if a commitment will be given to the family farms of Ireland, whose owners are listening today, that the Government will increase the co-funding rate on rural development programmes to the point where they will support farmers in meeting these climate and environmental targets.<\/p>  <p>  I have a question on the just transition fund.  From what I read - I may not have read it correctly - I thought I saw a cut in the fund.  I heard other speakers refer to it also but I also thought I heard the Taoiseach say the transition fund had been increased.  I would like clarity from the Minister of State on that.  As he knows, that just transition fund is very important, especially for workers in the midlands who rely on it.<\/p>  <p>  I referred to the following matter at the end of my first intervention.  It concerns the conditionality, or link between the funds - whether grants or loans - and the European semester and country-specific recommendations.  The Dutch got a sentence or two in the deal for what is called the Dutch brake.  This means payments can be held for a short period while checks are made as to whether countries are obeying conditionality rules.  It is a very significant move.  In my time in the European Parliament I saw how conditionality was applied to other funds, including the European Social Fund and regional funds etc.  Will the Minister of State give us some clarity on exactly how that conditionality will work if the Commission decides a member state is not staying within the rules as required, whether it is the Stability and Growth Pact or repayments etc.?

Some issues have been put forward that are not correct.  I want to be very clear about the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and I will answer Deputy Marian Harkin's question in this context.  The CAP budget for Ireland is protected.  Damaging cuts were originally proposed during the negotiations and they have been reversed.  The starting point back in 2018 was a 15% cut in rural development expenditure and a 4% cut in direct payments but in terms of the new proposal, Ireland's expected allocation for CAP is approximately &euro;10.7 billion in current prices for the next multi-annual financial framework for the next seven years.  That is actually a small increase in current prices on what was there previously.  This narrative that the CAP in Ireland has been cut is not a correct interpretation of what has been agreed.  I accept that it is complex, and that these documents are difficult for everybody.<\/p>  <p>  The other point is that the negotiating positions were changing on a regular basis, even over the weekend, and it is difficult at times to drill down into the figures.  These figures include an allocation which is stated at &euro;300 million but in current prices is &euro;337 million in recognition of the particular structural challenges facing the sector.  All of this took place against the backdrop of Brexit, Britain not at the table and a significant net contributor gone.  We have consistently opposed cuts to the CAP given the environmental and climate demands being made of farmers.<\/p>  <p>  On the climate issues that Deputy Harkin spoke about, Irish farmers are already doing a huge amount in respect of the environment.  Ireland is one of the member states with one of the highest levels of environmental spending under the Common Agricultural Policy in Pillar 2, for example.  New environmental schemes will be open to farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy and these will support farmers who are undertaking positive environmental actions.<\/p>  <p>  On the co-financing rate, very helpfully, the basic co-funding rate, as Deputy Harkin said, has changed as part of the negotiations; it is now at 43%.  There are different requirements for co-financing depending on the area the CAP intervention is being spent.  <\/p>  <p>  The make-up of the new CAP strategic plan will have a critical effect on the level of national funding required.  That is something that has been carefully worked through as we draw up our national plan in consultation with everybody but Members should be assured that rural Ireland is a big beneficiary of this agreement.  The issues Deputy Harkin raised relating to co-funding will certainly find support within the Government, within the budgetary constraints.<\/p>  <p>  On the just transition, Deputy Harkin is correct that different figures have been bandied about.  The exact position is that the original just transition fund was &euro;7.5 billion.  It is now &euro;17 billion, and Ireland will be a beneficiary of that.  This is a brand new programme and it is significantly enhanced.  It is important to make that clear.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the rule of law, a very important issue raised by Deputy Harkin and a very important one to us, Ireland firmly supports the rule of law.  It is one of the values of the European Union laid out in the treaties.  There are also the Article 7 proceedings where the European Council can determine if there is a clear risk or existence of a breach of the rule of law by a member state and may suspend certain treaty rights.  It is very important that all member states live up to their legal commitments and their human rights and democratic commitments.  Ireland supports what is in the MFF agreement and the Council Conclusions that the Commission can propose measures in cases of breaches affecting the budget for adoption by the Council by qualified majority.  It is possible that the Commission will be able to take action in appropriate cases where issues arise surrounding the rule of law and any decisions taken will be by the Council by qualified majority.  That is strong.  There were proposals for stronger measures but, like everything else in this negotiation, there is give and take to try to make sure that we come to an agreement that can work for everybody.  In terms of the rule of law, I believe those provisions can work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200040#NN00300","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1595428800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>When we are talking here today on these issues and other issues like it we have to talk about protecting the taxpayers' money.  We were talking earlier about the deal done in recent days in Europe in terms of money and how we will disburse it but &euro;21 million of taxpayers' money is a lot of money.  On 8 May 2020, the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, wrote to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, recommending \"a mandatory regime of self-isolation for 14 days at a designated facility for all persons arriving into Ireland from overseas\".  That has been reiterated at least four times by NPHET since May.  On 25 June, NPHET reiterated that advice with urgency.  The Citywest Hotel was rented until 22 October at a cost of almost &euro;21 million and as far as I know not one person is staying in it.  What does the Minister of State have to say about that &euro;21 million?  Is any person staying in Citywest at the pleasure of the State?  Have any people stayed in the hotel?  Will anybody stay there between now and 22 October?  What exactly is going on there at the moment?  It must be remembered that it is costing the taxpayer &euro;25,000 a day to rent this building.  How many more days is it intended that we will continue to use it?  I know that the Acting Chairman could use &euro;25,000 a day for his constituents, as I could do for mine.  We have many situations with regard to homeless people and many other types of people who could do with that money.<\/p>  <p>  We now have a green list of 15 countries.  Will there be a red list of countries from where people coming here will have to mandatorily self-isolate on arrival?  If there are legal issues around that, could the legal advice on that be put on the record?<\/p>  <p>  We have taken NPHET's advice on face masks and on traveller restrictions in our own country.  Pubs remain closed, as I said already, and at the same time the Government is not willing to take NPHET's advice on quarantining, and the cost of quarantining because that is the context I am bringing to this.  It is about money and what we are doing with money.  The Acting Chairman knows more than I do because he is a very experienced politician that our job as politicians is to be careful and mindful of the taxpayers' money.  I believe in my heart and soul that during this crisis a great deal of money is not being spent wisely or treated with the prudence the hard-working taxpayers of this country deserve.  The reason we pay taxes in this country is because people work.  Each one of the people here today - the ushers and everybody who is working in this system - is paying a considerable amount of money in tax to keep the country rolling but what I want is to see that money being spent properly and wisely, as I know does the Acting Chairman.  I would like the Minister of State to address that.

We now have our own troika here of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party going to Europe and coming back with this deal, which is ultimately a bad deal for workers, families, farmers and Ireland overall.<\/p> <p> I would like to put several questions to the Minister.  The exploratory document the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union issued to the various delegations following the meeting clearly stipulates that the issuance of funds will be dependent on the provision of recovery and resilience plans.  The document also states that these plans will be assessed within two months of submission to the EU.  The extensive cuts to the fund when compared with its original guise mark the failure to reverse the overall cut to direct payments.  We touched on those cuts here.  No matter how much spin the Minister of State and the Taoiseach try to put on it, the original proposal for the rural development budget was cut by &euro;7.5 billion.  That is a fact.  The Common Agricultural Policy budget has been cut by something like &euro;35.2 billion from the original proposal, and the Pillar 2 fund has been cut from &euro;15 billion to &euro;7.5 billion.  What provisions has the Government put in place and what is the timescale for drawing up the necessary plans and submitting them to the EU?  When will the limited funds that will be made available to Ireland be directed to where they are actually needed?<\/p> <p> I listened intently to a radio interview the Minister of State gave yesterday on \"Morning Ireland\".  He seemed to have little or no information on the content of the deal.  The interview was essentially an exercise in spin.  He stated that we would be net contributors to this fund but he was not able to articulate the actual cost to the Irish taxpayer.  Does he have the facts now?  Has he spoken to the Taoiseach and the Department and informed himself?

I regret that he was not able to go to Brussels but I appreciate the circumstances behind that, which concerned the Covid-19 crisis.  I welcome the agreement reached by the European Council on the multi-annual financial framework and the recovery stimulus package, which, as the Taoiseach has said, is unprecedented.  I also welcome the Brexit reserve fund.  Moreover, I support the general strategic approach adopted by the Taoiseach in these negotiations.  Ireland is a small, open economy.  We are an exporting nation dependent on free trade.  A strong and united Europe benefits Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Following some initial doubts about the capacity of the EU to respond to the Covid-19 crisis, a plan for moving forward has finally been agreed.  That is a good thing.  We were all beginning to wonder whether the EU was up to the challenge of Covid-19 and whether there would be solidarity.  This plan demonstrates that the EU is up to the challenge and is determined to bring about a Europe-wide economic recovery.  What is the position on own resources with respect to contributions to the cost of EU borrowing?  I refer in particular to the suggestion of a digital tax, which of course would have consequences for Ireland and the Irish economic model.  When will the issue of own resources be dealt with, and is that something about which Ireland should be concerned?<\/p>  <p>  My second and final question concerns European liberal democratic values and the rule of law, which have been discussed in the context of this debate.  I refer in particular to Hungary and Poland.  I would like to deal with that issue in the context of the recovery stimulus package.  I listened to what the Minister of State said in that regard and what was agreed by the European Council.  I note that the Dutch Prime Minister in particular was very adamant that the recovery package should be linked to this issue.  Will the Minister of State assure me that the Commission will be very vigilant on this?  It is an extremely important issue for the future of Europe.  If these countries refuse to uphold liberal democratic European values and the rule of law on an ongoing basis, will the Commission take affirmative action in the context of this stimulus package?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200041#OO00500","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1595429400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies for the questions.  Deputy Brady's question on the national recovery and resilience plans is very helpful.  With the greatest respect, I have to say that there has been a lot of confusion about this issue today.  To obtain the grants, member states are required to prepare national recovery and resilience plans setting out their reform and investment agendas for the years from 2021 to 2023.  Plans can be adapted in 2022 in advance of the final allocation of funds in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria for these plans, and ultimately for grants, will be the country-specific recommendations made under the European semester process.  People have mentioned the European semester process as a sort of bogeyman.  It is clear to me that, with the exception of Deputy Harkin and Deputy Haughey, nobody has read the European semester recommendations for Ireland for 2020.  If they actually read them, Members would be very pleased to see what the money will be spent on.  We will be required to put forward a plan that is consistent with those items, which have been recommended by the European Commission.  We need to invest in the resilience of our healthcare; preserve employment and address the social impact of the crisis; focus on research and development; ensure liquidity provisions and the stability of the financial sector; preserve the Single Market and the circulation of goods and services; emphasise social and affordable housing; address the digital divide, particularly in education; pursue public investment priorities like public transport; and as noted by Deputy Harkin, step up action on aggressive tax planning.  Who could be against this?  This is where positivity around the grants and what they will be spent on can be found.  The misrepresentation of what these grants will be spent on is very unfortunate.<\/p>  <p>  I have already gone through the details of the CAP budget and noted the modest increase in current prices.  Deputy Brady has made a fair point about the costs Ireland will undertake.  He had a fair point about my being on the radio at 8.15 a.m. yesterday when the deal had been concluded within the previous two or three hours.  As Deputy Haughey has said, I was not there because of a decision we had taken.  Normally the delegation would have 20 members, including the Taoiseach.  This time it had three, including the Taoiseach.  Our contributions to the EU budget are projected to increase considerably in the coming years as a result of our economic growth.  Irish contributions are expected to rise from about &euro;3 billion in 2021 to more than &euro;4 billion in 2027.  However, the exact contributions to the repayment of Next Generation EU borrowing are yet to be determined.  They will also depend significantly on what own resources arrangements are agreed.  It is not possible to give an accurate overall figure until we make a decision on own resources at European level.<\/p>  <p>  One thing that is clear is that recovery funds are needed now.  It is really important to remember that Ireland has benefited greatly from EU membership in economic terms.  The pharmaceutical jobs in Deputy Brady's constituency and any small or medium-sized enterprises that export to or depend on imports from the Single Market all depend on a strong Europe.  Deputy Brady's constituents who work in those firms depend on Europe having its act together, as it did this week.  That applies to the pharmaceutical industry in Clonmel and to the industries in Deputy Healy-Rae's constituency in Kerry, including Kerry Group, one of our largest exporters.  That industry is absolutely dependent on a good Single Market.  The same is true for the tourism industry.  It depends on Europe doing well so that its tourists come and spend their money here.  The benefits are wide-ranging.  We cannot simply think in terms of the figures for what we contribute and what we get back.  We have got back a hell of a lot more than we will ever put in.  We benefit hugely from this.<\/p> <p> Deputy Haughey raised the issue of own resources, and that is an important point.  It has been clearly set out that there will be a plastics tax levy as a first step and there is a new own resource based on the weight of non-recyclable plastic packaging waste.  That will be introduced next year.  The European Council has also asked the European Commission to bring forward proposals on a carbon border adjustment mechanism and a digital levy.  Any decisions on own resources would have to be made on the basis of unanimity, which means we would have a veto.<\/p> <p> The issue of a digital tax was raised.  This is a global issue which we believe needs an international solution.  We support the work being done in this regard at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  We are committed to examining these issues but, in general, we are sceptical in regard to own resources.<\/p> <p> I answered Deputy Haughey's question on the rule of law in my response to Deputy Harkin, but I will emphasise that we do support the rule of law.  It is true to say that we would have preferred a stronger measure in this regard, but the provision that is there is strong enough, allowing the Commission to propose measures in case of breaches of common European values that affect the budget.  The Council can adopt those proposals by qualified majority, which means nobody will be able to veto them, and they are absolutely crucial.  I make this point at the General Affairs Council when talking to my European colleagues.  It is a huge issue and there is widespread annoyance and, it has to be said, revulsion in some quarters at the breaches of the rule of law in parts of the European Union.  That has to stop.  We must not only send out a clear message that we do we not agree with what is happening but we must also show by example how the rule of law has applied in this State since the Civil War, to everybody's benefit, where there is respect for democracy, human rights, the courts system and the Garda.  That has helped us economically and socially.  Citizens of other member states can see that and we need to lead by example in this regard.

The amendment relates to section 15 and was tabled following discussions between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  It was determined that it would be appropriate to table an amendment to section 15 on Committee Stage in order to clarify the basis on which the Minister may support climate action projects.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the amendment is to provide legal clarity beyond any doubt in support of the intention in the Bill that it would be possible for the Minister to provide funding for climate action projects by way of either a competitive process or a non-competitive allocation.  Acceptance of the amendment would mean that it would not be mandatory for the Minister to conduct a competitive project selection process prior to supporting a climate project through the climate action fund.  The Minister would be permitted to invite an application for support under the fund from a specific climate action project, subject to the project being of a type which may be supported by the fund as provided for in the Bill.  Clarification of this matter in the legislation is important because there may be climate-related projects or investments that are not economic or commercial by nature and, as such, may not be eligible for consideration or successful under a competitive selection process.  The amendment will provide the necessary certainty that the fund may support such non-commercial projects as applicable.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies may recall, the amendment was tabled in the Seanad with a view to being able to pass the Bill today.  That, in turn, would allow us to get it to the President for signature such that it could be enacted before the end of July or on 1 August.  That would allow us to start drawing down funds at that stage for use in the fund.  It is hoped that this would be quickly followed by another call for projects.  That would provide a significant stimulus and economic lift right across the country as well as helping us to meet our climate targets.  On that basis, I hope the House will agree to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200043#VV00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1595430300,"counter":369,"content":"<p>The Minister stated on Committee Stage last week that the purpose of the amendment is to facilitate investment in Bord na M&oacute;na projects.<\/p> <p>I understand that is the basis for this amendment.  On that basis, I will be supporting the amendment.  I want to address the purpose of the amendment, which is to facilitate the employment of Bord na M&oacute;na staff to work on the cutaway bogs across the midland counties.  I commend that provision, which I asked this time last year to be included in the climate action fund.  I thank the Minister, his predecessor, Deputy Bruton, and the officials in the Department for taking that specific proposal on board.  The decision not to have a harvest this year is having a significant detrimental impact on many of the seasonal and permanent staff in Bord na M&oacute;na across east Galway, Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly.  Many of them are very dependent on that seasonal work and many businesses across the midlands are dependent on that.  I would like if the Minister could respond to me and provide some clarity to the employees in Bord na M&oacute;na who are in limbo and have been for the last number of months.  Some of them are drawing the pandemic unemployment payment, some are drawing the wage subsidy scheme through Bord na M&oacute;na and some are seasonal staff who were not called back this year and do not know whether they will get any work.  They are getting no financial support whatsoever even though their jobs are in limbo.  What is most frustrating for the employees in Bord na M&oacute;na is that they have been given no information from Government or Bord na M&oacute;na as to what is happening in the short to medium term in respect of employment.  I hope when the Minister responds that he will provide some clarity on that.<\/p> <p> I would also be grateful if the Minister could look into a specific issue for me.  I refer to the perverse situation where we the taxpayers are borrowing money to fund the pandemic unemployment payment and wage subsidy scheme within Bord na M&oacute;na for staff who have applied for the voluntary early retirement scheme.  They are looking for redundancy but Bord na M&oacute;na will not let them out to retire, yet they are receiving a subsidy from the State where there is no employment for them at present.  Surely it makes sense to let those staff who want to retire out the door and to try to secure as much employment as possible for the staff who are left within the company.  I think it is a public scandal that this is happening and I plead with the Minister to intervene.<\/p> <p> On the specific provision of the amendment, as the Minister said, its purpose is to look at projects where there may not be an economic dividend or it may not win purely based on the climate impact.  As the Minister knows, the purpose of that is to put money into Bord na M&oacute;na to provide employment for its staff.  I am led to believe that the plans that are currently being drafted by Bord na M&oacute;na to access this climate action fund are very heavy on capital and not so heavy in terms of employment.  That is completely unacceptable.  It was never my purpose when I was looking for this provision to be put in the legislation.  It was never the purpose of the climate action fund to look purely at capital investment.  I am told that the plans being drawn up are over-engineered and insufficiently labour intensive, when the Minister and I know very well that it must be the other way around.  While the Minister is not going to look for the same provisions in terms of the criteria regarding the funding he would give to Bord na M&oacute;na, I urge him to ensure that he gets independent advice to ensure that whatever work is carried out is as labour intensive as possible and ensures as much employment for the seasonal staff as is possible.<\/p> <p> The focus needs to be on rehabilitation of the bogs in the first instance and, second, providing public access through those bogs.  Last Sunday I had the opportunity to cycle from Ballinasloe to Shannonbridge through the bog just south of the town of Ballinasloe, along the existing railway works line.  It would be great if we had a proper walkway and cycleway through that bog from Ballinasloe right through to Shannonbridge.  The same is true in many of the other bogs across the midlands.  There are very detailed proposals coming forward about opening up the Mount Dillon bog complex in Roscommon and Longford for public access.  We should be getting Bord na M&oacute;na staff to do that work.  It is imperative that the funding that is made available through the climate action fund is for labour intensive work for that specific purpose and I hope the Minister will ensure that happens.<\/p> <p> We need to take the milled peat off these bogs urgently.  In the last fortnight I was on the road between Ballydangan and Cloonfad going past the bogs at Clonbern.  There was a brown cloud in the sky of milled peat which is on those bogs at the moment.  It is causing environmental problems across communities in that area.  That peat cannot be left on those bogs.  It must be removed.  I do not want the situation repeated that happened in Littleton, where milled peat was bulldozed into the drains.  If that were to happen across the midland bogs, it would cause an environmental catastrophe.  The milled peat would run from the drains into the River Suck and the River Shannon, compounding an already difficult environmental situation in those rivers as well as compounding the flooding problems we have within their catchments.  I want an assurance from the Minister that some mechanism will be found to ensure that the peat is taken off those bogs and burned in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge for power generation before the ground conditions deteriorate later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200043#VV00400","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595430600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I gave a little bit of leeway there.

The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, exists in its present form to ensure that Ireland maintains its minimum stockholding requirements for oil and petroleum products.  It is there to ensure our national security of energy supply in case of global disruptions.  As stated by the website of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and in the principal Act, the main purpose of the NORA levy is to fund the maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil reserves.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the proposed amendments to the principal Act, the Minister wishes to redeploy the levies on oil and petroleum products to establish the climate action fund and he has advised that it is not envisaged for there to be any significant cost to the Exchequer.  In the explanatory memorandum, it is advised that the provision of central treasury services by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, to NORA and Irish Water provides for efficiencies in the financial management of both agencies.  I think we all know the state that Irish Water is in financially and now it looks like our Government is going to toy with our energy security of supply.  I would therefore like to ask the Minister specifically how the National Oil Reserves Agency will be funded going forward if it is to share its funding with Irish Water, given that there will apparently be no increase in cost to the Exchequer.  Does it mean that we are now going to transfer the disgrace and shambles of Irish Water to our security of energy supply?<\/p>  <p>  We have all witnessed the severe disruption that Covid-19 has brought upon us.  The failure of our Government to invest in our health system and hospitals created a security of supply issue for our healthcare.  Do we now want to jeopardise our security of energy supply by redeploying the money to the climate action fund?  The climate action fund will hopefully be a positive development for our country&rsquo;s transition to cleaner energy sources but can the Minister explain how we will maintain an adequate security of supply going forward when the funds allocated to the National Oil Reserves Agency will now be significantly reduced?<\/p>  <p>  I spoke at some length last week about our security of supply situation regarding our current energy supplies.  While I welcome the fact that we will give clear support to the development of renewables and clean energy, I fear that it might not be enough to underline our security of energy supply while keeping energy prices competitive for our citizens.<\/p> <p>Renewables are highly volatile due to periods when the wind is blowing or not, or when the sun is shining or it is overcast.  As we move towards cleaner energy, the most likely realistic solution will require a combination of renewables with natural gas.  As renewables will also take time to develop into the major source of energy for our country, once again, I raise the critical issue of the security of our natural gas supply, which is dire.  The Minister wishes to increase energy efficiency under the recently proposed amendments for the climate action fund, and has now received approval for state aid for renewables.  This is a great achievement, and we are on our way to reducing emissions, but we need to get our house in order first.  While we have great news about the future, it has become increasingly clear that Ireland is severely exposed to security of supply issues in relation to our natural gas supply.<\/p> <p> The Minister may have seen on the news recently that the Kinsale gas platform, one of our few indigenous sources of natural gas supply, was recently turned off.  This will result in a loss of local jobs in Cork but it also means that we are now in an extremely vulnerable position with regard to our national security of supply for gas.  Ireland currently produces more than 50% of our electricity from gas and we import gas via interconnectors from the UK.  We have no existing gas storage on the island of Ireland, Corrib gas field will be gone within ten years, and we are now fully reliant on the UK for gas imports.  The UK is also reliant on gas imports and is experiencing its own declining gas production in the North Sea.<\/p> <p> The UK is also exiting the EU, which means new risks to our economy.  The UK and Ireland are good friends now, but the same cannot exactly be said about the EU and the UK who are going through a messy divorce.  If trade talks between the EU and the UK were to take a turn, not much would prevent the British national grid operator from increasing tariffs on the interconnectors between the EU and the UK which would in turn directly hurt the Irish economy.  I strongly ask the Minister to improve our security of supply situation for natural gas and I propose that, at minimum, the Minister considers a floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, import terminal which can guarantee our security of supply while developing offshore wind power and renewables.<\/p> <p> I support our move towards renewables in the coming years but it is clear that it will take time and we must be realistic.  Gas can and will play a key role as a transition fuel and in balancing power production from renewables in Ireland.  Once offshore wind power production and other renewables are in a position to replace fossil fuels, we can either use a floating LNG terminal as a pure security of supply option or disconnect it entirely if it is desirable for our country.  A floating terminal will allow this and we will not be left in the lurch while we make our move towards renewables.  This will help to put Ireland's energy transition and economic competitiveness first instead of outsourcing our energy needs to the UK and other countries.  I am also aware of a proposal from a company owned and located in Ireland which is ready to put in place world-class LNG infrastructure and commit to importing conventional LNG, not fracked gas.  I also have proposals for offshore wind power projects in the County Cork area.  These projects can complement each other as well as being truly supportive of our energy transition.<\/p> <p> We are in very challenging times and higher energy costs will hurt our economy.  I ask, therefore, that the Minister seriously considers both offshore wind power as well as a floating LNG terminal as viable options to support our economy with competitive energy, to diversify and ensure our security of supply of gas, and to ensure a practical, cost-efficient and just implementation of the energy transition in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200044#WW00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595431200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The Minister has said the Government amendment is to provide legal certainty on funding for projects where there will not be a competitive tender.  Bog rehabilitation was the example the Minister gave in the Seanad last week.  I understand and appreciate the rationale, but as my colleague, Senator Boylan, told the Seanad, and as I put it in this House last week, the Minister must put processes in place to ensure this mechanism is not misused by himself or his successors lest they wish to use it for their own pet projects.  It is in everyone's best interests that the highest standards of financial governance and oversight would be in place.  This money will be provided by the public, so it is important that there is transparency and accountability in the allocation of these funds.  We take the Minister's bona fides on this and therefore we are happy to support the amended Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I had asked for an updated figure on the current financial state of NORA.

However, in welcoming this provision, I ask the Minister to tell the House whether the commitments made by the previous Government on the repatriation of part of the public service obligation, PSO, funding, amounting to &euro;20 million per annum for the next four years, towards this project is not now the case, despite the commitments made and despite the understanding in Bord na M&oacute;na and among its workers, the regions and the constituency represented by myself and others.  If that is not now the case, does this amendment provide for &euro;20 million per annum over the next four years, as we were told at the time of the announcement when a commitment was given?  It would appear from my information that the EU Commission no longer supports that contention, that belief, that understanding, and that commitment that was given in this House and outside.  Will the Minister clarify that?<\/p>  <p>  Based on that answer, it is incumbent on me to ask two further questions so that I can get an answer for this House and my constituents.  I refer to the funding approved by the European Council this week.  Much has been alluded to in regard to the funding made available under various headings, whether it is the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, or the just transition and the reduction in funding associated with them compared with previous figures.  I acknowledge and appreciate that it would have looked far graver months ago were it not for the introduction of the emergency funding that compensates us in relation to the CAP and other areas.  I welcome that and appreciate the job faced by those with responsibilities to ensure that any such conditionality helps and assists those who partake in the schemes to improve their incomes and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister confirm the inclusion in the transition fund of peatlands in the coal regions?  Will he confirm that measures used and targeted towards the regions will target where there are and have been job losses to assist finding alternative jobs in those areas?  A commitment was given in the just transition report, which all stakeholders welcomed and approved, that the regions most affected would be targeted for such funding.<\/p> <p>On the first round of funding, which was only 50% of what was provided by Government and 50% of what was apparently provided by ESB, this was to be geared towards those areas most affected and that is not necessarily the case.  That is no disrespect to those applications in hand, that are being adjudicated upon and will be afforded.  In the context of the larger pot of funding that will be available under the Coal Regions in Transition programme, the criteria associated with that must accommodate those areas that are most affected.  Nowhere has been more affected in the context of these job losses than the county and constituency I represent.  I would appreciate a commitment that that will be the case.<\/p> <p> On that same report that was welcomed by all stakeholders and by Government and acknowledged by everybody who participated in its deliberations and ultimate publication by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, there was a commitment in that, which we all respected, to look at alternative use associated with the powerplants in Shannonbridge and Lanesborough.  As we speak, I have been made aware of the fact that ESB is seeking tenders and contracts for the decommissioning and demolition of these facilities.  That is a far cry from the commitment made by the Just Transition Commissioner and from the response from all parties and none to what was contained in this report's recommendations.  I hope the Minister will hold those bodies to account and engage with them to ensure that every opportunity is afforded to the localities and the regions and that the commitments that have been made by representatives, authorities and stakeholders to investigate, explore and ensure that other alternatives are found are fulfilled.  I call on the Government to support those alternatives which will have a role in ensuring that these regions have prospects from the facilities proposed to be demolished.<\/p> <p> I welcome the commitment contained within the amendment.  It is it is incumbent on the Minister to inform the House that this is now a replacement for a commitment that was made previously which was not honoured.  The reasons it was not honoured are not yet clear to me and need to be clarified and put on the record of the House.<\/p> <p> The Minister needs to go beyond that and to commit to what was originally envisaged, which was a four-year programme.  If he cannot do that, I ask them to say that now so that we know exactly where we stand.  These people, these areas and these regions have been let down a lot in the past two to three years since the first commitment was made.  We cannot afford that to continue or for it to be the case in the future.  I am now a member of a Government party and I am supporting this Government on the basis of the ambitions  contained in the programme for Government, one of which was to address just transition fairly and appropriately and I hope the Minister can guarantee that is the case and confirm the reasons commitments made previously cannot be stood over and what he is doing to ensure similar commitments can be made by this Government, as are contained within the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200045#XX00300","speaker":"1591","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595431800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta.

It is specifically those sorts of projects.  My predecessor, Deputy Bruton, the Deputy and other predecessors supported that approach and I am glad to ensure we deliver it here.<\/p>  <p>  On the level of employment, I have seen some figures and I have been encouraged that there is employment here.

The issue of the harvest not proceeding this year relates purely to environmental issues and the environmental impact assessment and it requires the company, as it moves from brown to green, to ensure it does not leave an environmental hazard where the peat would run off into the water.  I will pursue that directly with the company to ensure that is what takes place.<\/p>  <p>  There are real employment opportunities for this company across a whole variety of different areas, not just in the rehabilitation of bogs but in new energy projects.  The company&rsquo;s strategic plan last year is going in the right direction and that it should be going further and should be looking at additional and other ventures.  Some of the projects it was looking at were too narrow but it is absolutely what we should strive to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Michael Collins's question, at the end of last year, the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, had a fund, which has been built up over recent years, of &euro;230 million.  That provides an ongoing fund and capability for the company for the next number of years to be able to continue what it does, which is to maintain 90 days storage of oil reserves on storage facilities like Whiddy Island, which the Deputy would be very familiar with, and the Poolbeg peninsula.  Under an international agreement, it will have to be able to fund, manage and provide such secure energy stores.  This climate fund is not designed to remove that but to continue it.  The reality is that we can use revenues to do both.<\/p>  <p>  The interim funding of Irish Water by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, in short-term loans was a purely technical issue because NORA and Irish Water are both advised by the NTMA.  Long-term funding for Irish Water will not be coming from this fund and there is no connection between Irish Water and NORA which are separate entities.  The only connection being the services provided to both by the NTMA.  Both are fully independent.<\/p>  <p>  As to the development of a floating LNG import terminal in Cork Harbour, I read a detailed summation from an Irish company recently with interest.  That technology has taken off in different places around the world, largely through the development of large quantities of offshore fracked gas from the US market looking for a home.  In the programme for Government this Government has committed that that is not a development we want to see in our country.  We will be issuing a policy statement to say that is not the direction that we are going in.<\/p>  <p>  There is, however, huge potential for the development of alternative energy systems and secure energy supplies.  As has been said, the potential for offshore wind is something with which we have a great opportunity.  It will take time.  Increasingly, within the European Commission and other agencies, there is a recognition that the conversion of offshore electricity supply into green hydrogen supplies through electrolysis is something in which we may have a real competitive comparative advantage.  This is particularly the case where we have infrastructure in places like Cork Harbour, which is a deep safe harbour with deep berths.  That may be the future for energy security and energy storage systems.  The expertise that exists in those companies would be just as easily developed in that area, where there is growing interest and growing investment.  It is an area that could provide significant jobs and economic opportunities, particularly for Cork because of the harbour resources it has.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Rourke asked about the financial state of NORA.  As I said, this agency has a fund in the region of &euro;230 million at its disposal, so there are no immediate financial implications for the company.<\/p> <p>I was not able to accept the amendments on the day, partly because we wanted to immediately start drawing down the &euro;10 million in funding provided for in this Bill.  I indicated that I would look to implement some of the amendments tabled by the Opposition during the drafting of the climate action Bill, which is due in the autumn, especially those that would facilitate or support the use of this fund for community projects, which this amendment also supports.<\/p> <p> I give Deputy Cowen a commitment that the just transition approach will be developed for the entire midlands region, which is affected by the move away from the use of peat in both power stations and large, industrial-scale horticultural extraction that is occurring at present.  The funding of the bog rehabilitation through the application of public service obligation, PSO, fell foul of advice from the Attorney General that it would not be possible under European law.  In no way will that restrict us or stop us from making the necessary investments.<\/p> <p> I commit to Deputies that the climate action fund, which will provide funding for the projects that we need, will not just be for a one-off or an annual project.  We need the four year programme that was originally meant to be funded.  I recall that it was a &euro;20 million PSO per annum.  I hope that we will see something in a Government announcement tomorrow which will help us in that regard.  It is not just a case of waiting for an application to the climate action fund for us to be able to take action.<\/p> <p> Looking at the task we face in the context of making a 50% reduction in emissions over the next ten years and being a net zero emissions country by 2050, as we have committed to along with most European Union countries, the challenge is beyond compare.  One of the areas where I believe there is real potential for us to meet the targets is in storing carbon in our bogs and rewetting.  The estimates that I have heard from experts are that, if that is a 60 million tonne challenge, which it is at least, we could see something like 10 million tonnes delivered through the management of our peatlands in a different way.  We will have to make a significant investment.  We are only at the tip of the iceberg of what will have to be done.  I commit to doing everything I can to make sure that funding is available.<\/p> <p> We will try to draw down some of the funding that was agreed by the European Council.  That was a broad framework.  It did not cite specific projects.  I believe this type of work and the investment in Bord na M&oacute;na and other bog management companies is exactly the sort of project that would fit best with the European funding criteria.  I agree with Deputy Cowen that the just transition report that was delivered by Mr. Mulvey a couple of months ago has to be delivered.  The targeting of both European and national funding in this just transition has to be towards those communities most directly affected, including Deputy Cowen's constituency.<\/p> <p> With regard to the power plants, I said at some length at the end of the debate in the Seanad that alternative proposals for the deployment of those stations would be just such a project that might prove suitable in the context of the climate action fund.  Many of the projects we are looking at may be small, community projects, but that does not preclude big ideas and an alternative vision for what those plants could be used for.  I would also say in that regard that the asset in this area is not just the power station itself but also the grid connection.  As anybody involved in the renewable energy industry knows, getting grid access and connection is probably one of the most significant challenges to being able to finance and develop a project.  As well as a future for Bord na M&oacute;na in bog rehabilitation, energy retrofitting and alternative uses for the bogs in growing various products or being involved in aquaculture, I believe there is significant potential for the company in the development of renewable energy.  As well as its power station assets, it should look at leveraging its grid connection assets to make sure it has a bigger, brighter, more secure long-term future.  That is the purpose of this amendment and I believe it will have the backing of all Members of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200046#YY00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595432400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595432400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment reported.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1595432400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>A message will be sent to Seanad &Eacute;ireann acquainting it accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200047#ZZ00400","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595432400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.47 p.m. and resumed at 5.53 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1595433000,"counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200048#AAA00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595433000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595433000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595433000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Deputy Louise O'Reilly:I move amendment No.1:<\/p><p>This amendment is pretty much just a technical amendment designed to increase the timeframe in which a guarantee given pursuant to this agreement will increase from six years from the date of the agreement to seven years.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 the Department commissioned a review of the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme, which was carried out by First Choice Financial Services and AJS Financial Advice Limited.  They were appointed by the Department specifically to review this scheme.  The review focused on giving the scheme the best possible chance of success.  In the recommendations submitted to the steering committee appointed by the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the review findings stated that the three-year term was seen as too short as most loans are for a minimum of five to seven years.  They made a key recommendation to extend the term of the guarantee to seven years.  This was to allow for guarantees to be extended and, thereby, loans also.  The Bill seeks to extend that term to six years, and I submitted this amendment in part to seek to understand why one of the key recommendations of the report commissioned by the Department was not taken on board.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1595433000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I got a chance to touch on this briefly on Second Stages.  I will first explain what section 5 is about.  It introduces a new section 4A into the Act of 2012.  This new section 4A provides the Minister with the power, subject to the consent of both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to give guarantees in accordance with the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  The Covid-19 scheme will be open for guarantees to be put in place until December of this year, or no later than 24 December 2021 if the change is in the framework.  The later date allows the Minister, with the consent of the other two Ministers, to extend the scheme if the European Commission extends the provision in the temporary framework on state aid beyond 2020.  As of now there has been no confirmation from the Commission with regard to any extension.<\/p>  <p>  The focus of the amendment is actually about the temporary framework.  In the framework put forward it guarantees that the loans will not extend beyond six years in duration, which is in line with the flexibility contained in the Commission's temporary framework on state aid responses to Covid-19.  The maximum amount of credit, as we know, is up to &euro;2 billion, but the six years is the issue.  The timeframe of loans specified in this section of the Act is in direct correlation with the timeframe for permissible loans in the European Commission's state aid temporary framework.  Under the framework, within which the Covid-19 framework would operate, the maximum permissible duration of a loan is six years.  While we recognise the average loan performs over seven years, and we would not be against this ourselves in the context of normal schemes, we must work within this framework.  If loans are offered outside the terms of the framework it runs the risk of not being complaint, which can in turn have state aid costs implications for our small and medium businesses and the small mid-caps that borrow money under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I draw Deputy O'Reilly's attention to the future growth loan scheme, which offers longer-term loans of up to ten years.  During the discussion on this legislation and on the microfinance scheme, we were at pains to stress that this is not the only tool in the box.  It is one mechanism being put forward to try to guarantee credit out there.  It is only one of many.  The future growth loan scheme has a longer timeframe of ten years and might have better conditions for certain customers, depending on who they are.  The future growth loan scheme will be available to eligible SMEs and smaller mid-cap businesses and, importantly, to the primary agricultural and seafood producers in Ireland to support strategic long-term investment.  It captures the same cohort of businesses as the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, but with longer terms also.<\/p>  <p>  In policy terms it is important that these two schemes have different features for business.  The Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is designed to meet the liquidity needs of SMEs in the short to medium term, while the future growth loan scheme is more focused on longer-term strategic investment purposes.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Deputy understands.  It is not that we think the amendment is illogical.  It is quite logical, but we have to work within the framework or else there could be an implication in respect of state aid rules later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200048#AAA00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595433000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595433000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1595433000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 5, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(4A) The Minister shall ensure that monies loaned in accordance with the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme shall&mdash; <blockquote> \t(a) be loaned interest free with zero repayments for the first 12 months of the loan, and<br \/><br \/>(b) interest rates on such loans shall be capped at 2.5%, with interest only being applied to cover the overheads of administering the scheme.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>The interest rates charged on the loans are normal business loans rates from the respective banks with the additional 0.5% charge because of the Government guarantee.  Furthermore, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which funds the scheme through the guarantee, plays no role in the application or decision-making process, which is fully delegated to the participating lenders.  As a result, the loans are issued at the respective banks' market interest rate.  In other words - and this has been pointed out by trade unions and others - the banks now administer the scheme and make the decisions as to whether or not to issue loans based on their own for-profit criteria for loan issuance, and not the criteria of a Government Department.  We are here today to debate a scheme designed to keep businesses afloat during a global pandemic.  There is nothing in the scheme that speaks to the pressure thousands of businesses across the State are under.  I put it to the Minister of State that we have discussed this previously and one of the things that keeps coming back to me when I engage with business owners, and especially small family businesses, is the absolute resistance to taking on additional debt and unsustainable debt.  They are absolutely petrified of this.  Businesses themselves have pointed out these flaws, so the Minister of State is more than well aware.  Organisations such as Chartered Accountants Ireland have also had their say.  They have highlighted at first hand the problems businesses have in accessing loans with such high interest rates as those provided by the scheme.  They have stated that the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is too onerous and complex to administer, and that the interest rates are prohibitive.  They say the interest rates need to be closer to the ECB rates than to commercial rates.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State already said, he will have no hand, act or part in that decision-making process.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for similar low interest rates for a number of months.  This was included in our letters to the Minister for Finance, in May, and to his predecessor.  We have been calling for interest rates to be capped at 2.5% with interest rates preferably only applied to cover the overheads of administering the loan scheme.  Low interest rates will encourage SMEs to take up the loans that are available.  We have heard this first-hand from businesses and their representative bodies.  They have also indicated that it would be a huge incentive and would help them greatly if the loans were interest-free, with zero repayments for the first 12 months.  This is standard practice for many of the Covid-19 credit guarantee loan schemes across the EU.  It would make a significant difference to the loan scheme here.<\/p> <p> The Government should be looking at a payment deferral process to facilitate employers getting workers back to work and the economy going again.  The deferral of interest even for 12 months would go a long way towards that.  The acceptance of these measures would make the credit guarantee scheme loan scheme more attractive to business during this unprecedented and extremely difficult time.  Unprecedented measures surely have to be the order of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200048#AAA00700","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595433600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of interest costs because I did not get the chance to go into the detail on this yesterday.  It is important that when we are having these discussions, SMEs, as well as those who provide assistance to them, such as State agencies and Chartered Accountants Ireland, recognise that this is only one of several interventions that the State is making, using taxpayers' money to help businesses to reopen, restart, survive, grow and create employment, as well as to maintain existing employment and take back some workers.  We recognise that businesses need a combination of access to finance, loans, direct grants, rate waivers and wage subsidies.  The wage subsidy scheme has already cost the taxpayer over &euro;2 billion but is money well spent and everybody recognises that.  Most SMEs have told me that they could not have survived without it.<\/p>  <p>  Most SMEs and business owners are practical people.  They know that the taxpayer will not be able to write the cheque for every part of this.  Some part of this credit guarantee will facilitate the refinancing of existing loans.  I get it that businesses of all shapes and sizes are reluctant to take on more debt.  One cannot blame them because it is an extra cost.  We have to make it as easy as possible to access the finance and then keep costs as low as possible.  That is what the State guarantee is about.  We will reduce the costs, but access is important.  All the research shows that access to money is the main priority for businesses.  We can then trash out the cost.  Getting one's hands on finance is the first priority for a business to survive.  It might be for a new loan or just to reorganise the existing finances.<\/p>  <p>  The way that this legislation and the legal agreements and documentation which will underpin it have been drafted is intended to provide assistance from the State to qualifying enterprises.  The legislation leverages financial institutions and their network to provide much needed liquidity to our SMEs, small mid-caps and primary producers.  Deputy O'Reilly quoted Chartered Accountants Ireland on the administration of and the red tape relating to the scheme.  This scheme is not yet in operation, however.  That has to be done in negotiations.  The Deputy was referring to a previous scheme which we are now changing.  Every effort will be made to make that easier.  With the new criteria, that will happen and the scheme will be easier to administer.  It will lead on to reduced interest rates across a whole range of financial products.  It will be much more attractive for the financial providers to use it and for those drawing down loans.<\/p>  <p>  Unlike the lending through Microfinance Ireland we discussed two weeks ago, this is not lending from the State but through participating financial institutions, such as commercial banks, credit unions and others, that will successfully apply via the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland's open call.  Much of the focus last night was that this is only for the three main pillar banks.  That is not the case.  This is for all financial providers which want to provide loans to SMEs, including credit unions.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been clear in his most recent meetings with the CEOs of the pillar banks that he expects an interest rate reduction from them for participating in the scheme in order that participating enterprises will benefit from those reductions.  He has received positive indications from those banks and this will be reflected in the legal agreements for the scheme involving the Department, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The interest rates for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme differ from other schemes administered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland such as, for example, the future growth loan scheme.  Precise reductions are still under discussion.  We need to remember that there will be different rates for different financial products, with different customer profiles and for different financial sizes.  Accordingly, it is difficult to be precise about interest rates in this legislation.  The reduction to customers will be transparent, however, when they sign the deal with banks or other institutions, as a result of this Government's support.  This will also show the premium to be paid as part of the state aid rules.<\/p>  <p>  This is a good opportunity for businesses to get strong levels of State support without any state aid implications.  Also important is the fact that this scheme is a support for businesses, not for the banks.  That needs to be stressed because it was missed in the debate last night.  The advantage of a credit guarantee scheme is that it leverages the detailed local knowledge of finance providers, including banks, credit unions and others, in what supports are needed in their local communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has the right of audit on all transactions.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland will interact with the finance providers on a frequent basis.  Between us, we will ensure that the discount has been applied.  No doubt Deputy O'Reilly will be keeping an eye on the matter too.  People will vote with their feet.  If customers feel they are not getting a proper discount, they will not use the product.<\/p>  <p>  Capital and-or interest moratoria for up to one year will be permitted under the scheme.  It is important to emphasise, however, that any decision in this regard will be by agreement between the finance provider and the participating enterprise on an individual basis.  This has been a matter for discussion between the banks and the Department.  We should also remember that some of these loans may only be for terms of one to three years.  It is not best practice to backload all the payments for a business into a short-term loan because this could lead to financial stress being just as acute at the end of the loan as the start.  Naturally, the banks and other lending institutions will work with individual customers to see what terms suit them best.  There is great scope to adjust at the local level for existing and new customers.  Of course, it will be monitored.<\/p>  <p>  The Government cannot accept restricting the use of any interest earned to solely cover the costs of administering the scheme.  The costs of administering the scheme are quite large, for both the financial institutions and the State.  If we were to charge these costs directly to the participating enterprises, it is likely that the interest rates would be much higher than the discount rates we are discussing with the banks.  I accept that Deputy O'Reilly would like to see what that would entail.  It is only when those discussions conclude and the scheme is up and running that we will get a real clear picture of what has been achieved as a result of this scheme.  We are confident that this legislation will enable this conversation with the banks because it will allow them to make credit available cheaply.<\/p>  <p>  The State is covering its own costs through Exchequer funding rather than passing these on to businesses.  It is only charging the premium to cover the guarantee, which is required by state aid rules and which will be administered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland on behalf of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I hope Deputy O'Reilly understands that the Government's intention is to retain some flexibility in the operation of the legislation to allow for changing circumstances rather than freezing a given set of conditions into the primary legislation.  This is why we are dealing with these issues by means of the statutory instrument, which sets out the details of the scheme and the operating agreement and other legal agreements involving the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the participating finance institutions.<\/p>  <p>  We are acutely aware of the difficulties faced by enterprises and are doing all we can to put in place a range of measures to help those enterprises to recover from the impacts of Covid-19, as well as to keep the costs of these measures as low as possible.  This includes the interest being charged on loans and the administrative costs of applying for schemes, as well as providing advice, guidance and grants through our enterprise agencies and helplines on the range of schemes available that are most suitable for the needs of individual enterprises.<\/p> <p> In the debate on this Bill, reference has been made to what other countries are doing.  We track what they are doing.  A credit guarantee scheme similar to ours is in operation in many of them.  They are slightly different versions.  Most have a ratio of 80:20 like we do.  Some have greater percentages of risk on the part of the state for lower loans of up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.  Our microenterprise loan provides up to &euro;50,000 with a rate of practically 100%, given that it is a State-guaranteed bank.  Not every scheme can be measured in one sentence, but we have tracked them all and we believe that our credit guarantee scheme is up there with the best in any other country.  However, I accept that Deputies will only see that when it is up and running.  One cannot judge what is going to happen in the future based on the current scheme, as it is different from the one proposed in this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200049#BBB00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595434200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to some of the Minister of State's points.  I do not mean this in a disrespectful way given that he is in attendance, but we raised the issue last night of the relevant senior Minister not being in the Chamber.  The Minister of State advised that was because there was a Cabinet meeting.  I do not believe it was ongoing at the time, but I appreciate that he may have been busy.  However, this legislation is before us again and, once more, the Minister is not present.  The Government scheduled the time for this Bill and it knows when its own meetings will be.  It is not beyond reason to expect that the relevant Minister - to stress, I do not mean this disrespectfully to the Minister of State who has turned up - should be in attendance to take legislation.  This is not good practice.  I appreciate that people are busy and we are approaching the end of the D&aacute;il term, but the Government schedules business with the Business Committee.  At the next Business Committee meeting, perhaps the Government representative could have a chat with the relevant line Ministers to ensure that they make themselves available when their own legislation is being debated.  What is happening is not acceptable and is bad practice and I do not want to see it creeping in.  We are on Committee Stage and it would be preferable were the Minister present.  This is something that we cannot allow to become a pattern.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, I wish to respond to some of the points the Minister of State made.  He mentioned that the T&aacute;naiste had received positive indications from the banks.  Could he give us anything more concrete than that?  I would appreciate a briefing on the Government's meetings with the banks to date and what they are saying.  They will be administering the scheme.  Once the legislation is passed, the Government has made it clear that it will be up to the mostly for-profit banks to administer the scheme.  The Government stated that it will have a hands-off approach.  There are different rates for different financial products, but if a struggling small family business is trying to get back up on its feet and hears a Minister saying that there will be different rates for different products, that just means the rates could be higher.  There is a possibility that they could be lower, but the possibility also exists that they could be higher.  These are people who are in very desperate situations.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Minister of State, a moratorium will be permitted under the scheme.  I am relieved, as I am sure others are, that the Government will not outlaw such a prospect, but that does not mean that there will be moratoriums.  It just means that moratoriums will be allowed.  In the course of the Government's deliberations with the for-profit banks, what have they been saying about a moratorium?  Are they minded to give people a moratorium?  Are they minded to realise the sort of pressure these people are under?  We should bear in mind that many of these small businesses are only just emerging from the debts they incurred because of the last recession.  The prospect of more debt and dealings with the banks will not fill them with any kind of hope.  Will the Minister of State give us more detail about what the Government has been saying to the banks and what they have been saying in response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200050#CCC00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1595434200,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but I had to step out for another meeting.  I have no issue with the Minister of State's good self and this has nothing to do with him, but it is a disgrace that the Minister is not present.  This day last week, a Minister of State was sent in with ten minutes to go.  Unfortunately, I was in the Chair and I had to suspend the House because the Minister of State had no briefing and was unable to answer.  We had to go into the corner over there and talk to his officials about the significant borrowing and schemes in which we are about to engage.  This is not good enough.  We are supposed to have pre-legislative scrutiny, detailed discussions on Committee Stage and the legislation deliberated on in the House, but we have waived the pre-legislative scrutiny phase, no committees have been set up and, according to the reports from the D&aacute;il reform committee I have heard in the past half hour, there will be bulldozing all the way by the new Government.  And we are expected to pass this Bill.<\/p><p>I stand here as someone who voted for the bank guarantee.  I am like a bad record saying that it left a bad taste in my mouth and was the greatest mistake I ever made in my political life.  Here we are again, though, looking at proposals like this one.  It is being put through on a whim without scrutiny, Committee Stage debate, any real time for amendment or so on.  I am concerned when the Minister of State says that we have to get this through and that time is not on our side but that there will be statutory instruments.  The House has no discourse about or input into what goes into statutory instruments.<\/p><p>According to the Minister of State, the heads of the banks have given positive indications.  The banks do not know what positive is.  They do not do positive.  They do it for themselves.  The people are in penury trying to pay back the bailout because of the way the banks were allowed to carry on.  There has still been no legislation introduced to deal with them.<\/p><p>I have major concerns about the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and the three pillar banks getting their claws into this.  There may be different suites of options and rates, but the banks' <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>is to make healthy profits.  They have no interest in the struggling people.  We saw what solace the banks gave them.  There was supposed to be a moratorium over the past four or five months and no evictions because of the pandemic, but there has been nothing but evictions, court appeals and the like in the commercial area.  It is as if there is no pandemic.  The banks tell the Government one thing and it listens to them.  This is like the European situation.  Instead of being the whipping boys, the Government could tell them what to do, but no.  There is no legislation to control them so the banks can give us the two fingers on both hands.<\/p><p>I am worried about how they will handle this money and deal with people who get into distress, particularly small SMES of one self-employed person and two or three employees.  I have seen this happening already in the case of employees who were in receipt of the pandemic payment.  They had loan approvals for mortgages, but because they were in receipt of the payment, the banks pulled their approvals.  The banks want any reason, big, little or small, not to lend to and support people.  They are just looking for those reasons.  It could be the most minute issue, but they want a reason to refuse support.  In the spirit of n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile, we support one another, but banks do not do that.  They have got away with so much.  They had free rein in what they did to the country during the banking crisis.  They were then bailed out and my grandchildren will be paying that back.  The banks did not learn their lesson because they walked away scot free.  There are conflicting messages from the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach about the Government's meetings with the banks.  The banks wheel out their former politician and now PR spokesperson.  I have no issue with him, but they are putting a spin on this and putting people through grief.<\/p><p>There are businesses that are on their last legs.  Some of them are run by people who are over 66 years of age and on the old age pension.  They are self-employed, be they publicans, shopkeepers, bus drivers, undertakers or candlestick makers.  They cannot get a bob and the banks will give them no leniency to stay afloat.  They cannot feed themselves.  They will be forced to get assistance from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  They literally cannot live.  They cannot live on the wind.  There have been some horrific stories.  There is no point in going to a bank with the b&eacute;al bocht.  One will get an doras d&uacute;nta.  Banks will not even meet someone now.  They have removed themselves from most small towns in the regions.  They have pay machines and so on.<\/p> <p>A customer does not meet the bank manager any more.  At one time the bank manager knew the bank's customers and their capabilities and he or she had a good relationship with them.  There was two-way trust.  Now, the banks are screwing the customer for whatever they can get out of him or her.  They want only to take in whatever money they can and to make as much profit as they can.  We all know what happened in regard to the tracker mortgages.  Do we need any more evidence?

The Deputy had to leave early last night as well and I did not get an opportunity to do a full wrap-up today.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned he has concerns about the legislation.  This legislation amends existing legislation which has been in place since 2012 and was also amended in 2016.  This is not new legislation that has popped out of nowhere.  We are adding in new schemes to deal with the Covid-19 emergency situation under the EU framework, which will lead to lower interest rates and more finance being available to companies of all sizes.  More important, for a man from Tipperary who is very concerned with producers, it adds in opportunities for producers, farmers and fisheries as well.  That is the key.

I accept the Deputy's concerns in that regard.  We had discussions with the banks, led by the T&aacute;naiste.  Their focus is on getting a good quality product across a range of different offerings out to people who need this money.  I do not share the Deputy's concerns.  This legislation has been talked about since May and it was produced back then.  We had to form the D&aacute;il to bring it through.  I have thanked the Houses for their co-operation in bringing it through quickly.  I acknowledge that people waived their right to committee scrutiny because everyone recognised the importance of reaching SMEs with finance.  We sometimes have to move fast in this House.  The legislation is not dramatic.  It does not change the legalities of the scheme.  Rather, it makes it a much better scheme.  It is a scheme that we own.  The State gives this guarantee.  We only give the guarantee to the banks.  It is apportioned out to each of the individual banks if we agree with what they are going to do and if they are doing what we want them to do.  If a particular bank does not decide to use the scheme in the right way, then it will not be using the scheme.  That is fair enough.  Customers will go somewhere else.  The Deputy might dislike banks but I am sure he would complain if a bank announced it was moving out of a particular town in Tipperary because jobs and so on would be lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200051#DDD00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595434800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1595434800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>We are using the existing bank network to distribute the finance to people who need it.  If we set up our own network, it could slow down the process, it could be cumbersome and costly and so on.  The credit guarantee, which works all across Europe, is done this way.  We guarantee the financial products.  This puts the banks in a stronger position to give people a better deal on their loans.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  We all want the same thing, namely, access to finance and access to it on simpler terms and at lower cost in monetary terms as well.  That is what we are trying to achieve with this legislation.  We believe this will happen because this legislation also removes the portfolio cap, which, as rightly identified by many in this House, was a major impediment to achieving those lower interest rates.  In passing this legislation, we will be in a much stronger position to reach out with a better financial product.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned a mix of products.  There are numerous banks and lending institutions that will use this scheme and, therefore, there will be a range of products available.  I hope we will see competition in terms of prices and interest rates.  There will also be different types of loans such as overdrafts, term loans, and longer term loans of three years, five years and six years.  That is what I meant when I said there would be a mix of products.  We will track them all.  Following enactment of this legislation, we will work with the banks in the weeks ahead to have these loans up and running by September or, all going well, before that if we can with lower cost of funding as well.  Legislation is not where one would write in the interest rate or the terms and condition of loans.  That is part of the agreement process and the legal documents that will be signed between the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the lending institutions that are going to avail of this scheme.  This is not confined to the pillar banks.  Lest members missed this point last night, this is not just about the pillar banks, although they are the predominant entities in the discussions thus far.  The first 30% of funding will be allocated, if they want it, to those banks.  The remaining 70% will be an open call to credit unions, post offices and other financial institutions that want to avail of the scheme.  I ask members to bear in mind that it is open to all of the financial institutions that want to lend money.<\/p>  <p>  I will move now to the questions raised by Deputy O'Reilly.  I do not take offence that she is insulted that I am here and not the senior Minister.  To be clear, I would expect that business people who follow this debate and listen to us discuss matters that will affect them and their businesses in accessing funding would expect this House to act in a reasonable businesslike manner.  I refer not to Deputy O'Reilly but to Deputy Pearse Doherty who last night made a big drama out of the T&aacute;naiste not being here for the debate.  He was acting like a child.  I mean no offence to Deputy O'Reilly.

He knew that the European Council meetings ran over by a couple of days, the knock-on effect of which was that the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet meetings were rescheduled.  The T&aacute;naiste wanted to be here to open the debate because this is legislation on which he has worked in his Department and in respect of which he has been on the airwaves.  It was arranged by Government to make sure we could all be there for the debate and the T&aacute;naiste was to open that debate.  He could not do it because of the knock-on effect of EU meetings, which are important to this country, which Deputy O'Reilly knows because she is an intelligent person.  The knock-on effect of the rescheduling of Cabinet meetings meant that he could not be in the House last night.  That is why he was not there.  That should be acknowledged and respected.  We acknowledged it.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, I was the first to thank all Members for their co-operation in getting this important legislation through the House.  I recognise we are doing so in difficult circumstances in terms of moving back and forth to Leinster House and so on and that can be complicated.

Sometimes, fast-tracking legislation and setting agendas a week before means that speakers might not be able to make it.  That happens on the Opposition benches as well.  The T&aacute;naiste could not be in the House for the debate last night but he would have like to have been there.

I took that legislation through on behalf of my then senior Minister.  We announced that there were no evictions and that businesses are still under pressure but those evictions are linked to domestic and residential premises, not commercial premises.  I make that point in case there was any doubt in regard to that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies are right that, for businesses, rent and their conversations with their landlords and lending institutions around how they can pay that fixed cost form a big issue.  There is no doubt that there is an issue brewing in that regard.  It comes up in all of our discussions with the SME groups as well and we trying to address it.  The programme for Government commits to bringing forward criteria to deal with that as well.  Other measures are being examined.  The July stimulus package that will be announced later this week will include more supports.  We are very much aware of the issue but Deputies are right to raise it.  I want to clear up the concern in regard to evictions.  It is not possible under that legislation to deal with commercial evictions.  That was not the intention behind it.  We are aware that there is an issue.  Different countries are taking different approaches in terms of how to address it.  My Department and other Departments will come together to work with the sector to identify ways we can help it to get through that as well.<\/p>  <p>  I will return now to the scheme and the interest rates and making them available.<\/p> <p>I stress that this is one offering in the toolkit.  There are also restart grants and waivers of rates and other costs.  I ask Deputies, therefore, not to consider this to be the only solution.  It is not a silver bullet and it is not meant to be.  We firmly believe that this scheme will facilitate lending at lower interest rates.  It has to do so under the EU framework; that is what it is about.  Everyone in our meetings knows that is what this is about.  It has been proven to work in many other countries.  We all agree the existing scheme in this country does not provide the solutions we now need for Covid, which is why we are addressing the scheme in the Bill and changing the criteria for it within the scope of the EU framework.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that Deputy O'Reilly would like to outline the interest rates in the legislation but, again, it is not the suitable place to do so.  If she wants briefings on the interactions with the banks, I can arrange that for her.  Those discussions will continue in the coming weeks if we get this Bill through this House today and the Seanad tomorrow.  Hopefully, the President will be able to sign it into law quickly.  We can then finish our negotiations with the banks on the details of the scheme and statutory instruments will be signed.  I think the Deputy will be happy with what comes out of that and the offer that will be made.  As I stated several times, I acknowledge that the Deputy does not agree but I ask her to let the legislation go through so that we can finish this work and get the money to businesses that need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200051#DDD02400","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595435400,"counter":424,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595435400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Section 5 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595435400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Sections 6 and 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595435400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595435400,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595435400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.35 p.m. and resumed at 6.40 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Debenhams Ireland Redundancies: Motion [Private Members]","time":1595435700,"counter":430,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200053#FFF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1595435700,"counter":431,"content":"<p>We are resuming with Private Members' business.

the threat of mass redundancies facing many other workers in many sectors and industries in the coming period; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in the case of Debenhams, the State is the first creditor that the liquidators seek to settle with on amounts due for various taxes and rates owed; <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; legislate as a priority to strengthen the rights of workers facing redundancies and layoffs, and specifically to legislate to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; reorder the priority afforded to workers as creditors in any liquidation process by amending section 621 of the Companies Act 2014;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; amend the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to increase the compensation for workers from four weeks to two years in cases where their employer has contravened sections 9 and 10 of the Act;

and <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>in recognition of the failure of the State to act in this area and to protect workers like those in Debenhams, calls on the Minister for Finance, Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Taoiseach to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; notify the liquidators in Debenhams that the State will forgo its priority as a creditor and instruct the liquidator to use funds realised instead to pay the enhanced redundancy payments agreed between the Debenhams workers and the company;<br \/><br \/>and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; immediately initiate negotiations with representatives of the Bank of Ireland to ensure the workers receive the full collective redundancy package previously agreed with the Debenhams company. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputies Gino Kenny and Mick Barry.  The treatment of 1,400 Debenhams workers by Debenhams, a very large company that continues to make profits in this country through online sales and which continues to operate in the North of this country and operate and make money in Britain, has been nothing short of despicable.  We have heard descriptions from workers about how, essentially, they were tricked by the company using the cover of the Covid-19 pandemic to suggest that various things it was doing, such as stocktaking in stores and movement of goods etc., were related to the Covid-19 issue.  These had nothing to do with Covid-19 but instead were related to a tactical liquidation, using the cover of the pandemic to dump these 1,400 workers, most of whom had worked for the company for decades.  These workers gave loyal service in Debenhams stores all across the country but were dumped in the most cynical way.<\/p><p>Our motion seeks the justice that should have been given to these workers if previous Governments had acted to tackle similar actions in this country over recent years.  The most recent case is that of Clerys, which had a similar liquidation process and where workers were dumped.  Before that we have the examples of La Senza, Vita Cortex and Thomas Cook.  They are just the cases I am familiar with, although there are probably others that people can remind me of.  Time and again, and particularly in the retail sector and department stores, retail workers have been treated in this absolutely outrageous way.<\/p><p>After the Clerys dispute, the Duffy-Cahill report was produced, which suggested that there should be a reordering of the priority of creditors in cases of liquidation in order to ensure that workers could not be treated in this way.  This would ensure workers would become priority creditors when it came to the liquidation of assets, companies would not be able to run away with assets and other people could not take priority over the workers who generated the wealth, as Debenhams workers have done over many years.  Successive Governments have failed to do this.  Five years after the Clerys dispute, this has not been done and the Debenhams workers find themselves in their current position.<\/p><p>The cynicism of Debenhams goes on as clearly this was orchestrated well in advance of Covid-19.  This company has significant assets and we only need to know what is in the stores around the country to see that it has tens of millions of euro in assets.  It also has an online business.  Essentially, the company tried to take the assets off the balance sheet by making Debenhams Ireland co-guarantors in a &pound;200 million debt taken out by Debenhams UK.  This is just an accountancy manoeuvre deliberately designed to lay the ground for the liquidation, leaving the workers with nothing.<\/p><p>Quite rightly, the workers have not accepted this.  There is no doubt Debenhams hoped workers would be shell-shocked and demoralised and in the context of the pandemic that they would just take this lying down.  To their eternal credit, this inspiring group of workers, mostly women, have stood up, fought for their rights and refused to be treated in this despicable way.  They are now in their 104th day of protest and at Henry Street and other stores round-the-clock pickets are being mounted to prevent the liquidators, KPMG, from moving in and taking those assets when those assets should be liquidated to the benefit of the workers.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach said he had great sympathy for the workers.  When I and others raised this in the past number of weeks, he told us he was greatly sympathetic and the treatment of Debenhams workers was disgraceful.  He said he would look at legislation going forward but there was nothing he could really do.  That was the implication for this particular group of workers.  In this motion we are making a concrete proposal that can be achieved.  It is something that arose from a meeting of the workers and the liquidator, when it became clear the Government is a priority shareholder.  Therefore, the Government can waive its priority and instruct KPMG to give a better redundancy deal to the workers in the form of the four weeks of pay per year of service and ensure they are the top priority in the liquidation of assets.<\/p><p>The workers do not want tea and sympathy but tangible action to give them the justice they deserve.  We also want the legislation to ensure similar cases do not arise in future with similar groups of workers.  The workers are marching here later this evening because they were not aware of the change in the D&aacute;il schedule.  If we want to send a message of solidarity and hope to those workers, the Government should accept this motion and drop its amendments, which other speakers will address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200053#FFF00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1595435700,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I commend the Debenhams workers who have been on strike for more than 105 days through very difficult circumstances because of the public health emergency.

It has been a very difficult time but their solidarity and support for each other is inspiring for anybody who supports the trade union movement.  It is everything that is good about working class people.  It is about standing together, shoulder to shoulder, when they are up against it.<\/p>  <p>  These workers are fighting for a fair redundancy.  Some of these people have worked with Debenhams for over 25 years.<\/p> <p>Can the Minister of State imagine how he would feel if he was treated like that having worked for an employer for 25 years?

It passes legislation to protect workers and so forth but in one night in 2008, the banks were completely guaranteed in respect of all their debts, yet legislation that could protect workers in redundancy such as the Debenhams workers has never been passed.  That leaves a very bitter taste in people's mouths.  It is ironic that the Bank of Ireland has a 14% share in Debenhams so it has an obligation to the workers to give them a decent settlement and a decent redundancy.<\/p> <p> As a member of the Government, the Minister of State should call in members of Bank of Ireland and ask them what their obligation is to the Debenhams workers.  He has the power to do that because in 2008 the Government bailed out the banks to the tune of &euro;4.6 billion.  I will repeat that figure - &euro;4.6 billion.  It is an incredible amount of money.  Taxpayers in this country have been on the line for that money yet workers are screwed every time they try to stand up to their employers.<\/p> <p> The Debenhams workers are an inspiration, not only to the trade union movement but to the working-class movement.

We are just down the road from Liberty Hall, the headquarters of James Connolly and Jim Larkin, and the locked out workers of 1913.  We are a little more than a mile away from the scene of the world-famous Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strike of the 1980s, and now we have another historic strike taking place here in Dublin's north inner city.  Striking workers, overwhelmingly women, are picketing Debenhams stores at 11 separate locations across the country - in Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Galway, Limerick, Newbridge and Dublin, including here at the company's flagship store in Henry Street.  There is no doubt that this is a historic strike.  We have only to look at the timing.  It is the first strike of the coronavirus era.  In terms of the duration, it will be 15 full weeks tomorrow.  This strike is a litmus test of how working people will be treated in the age of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I want to say at the outset that the motion put before the House tonight by Solidarity-People Before Profit is a very moderate one.  A radical motion would call for the 11 stores or, at the very least, several of them, to be taken into public ownership to save jobs.  Instead, this motion focuses on the redundancy issue and serves to support the demand of the workers themselves that they be paid four weeks per year of service rather than the bare statutory two weeks that is currently on the table.  By the way, Debenhams workers have a collective agreement with the company, which is seven years old now, for four weeks.  It is an implied condition of employment and it should have the legal force of a condition in a contract of employment.<\/p>  <p>  In 2003, the Canadian professor and legal theorist, Joel Bakan, made a documentary movie called \"The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power\".  In that powerful anti-capitalist film, Bakan shows the eerie similarities between the personality of the modern-day corporation and the personality of a psychopath - callous disregard for the feelings of others, incapacity to maintain human relationships, deceitfulness, incapacity to experience guilt, etc.  If Mr. Bakan ever decides to make a sequel, I would respectfully suggest that he might look no further than the case of Debenhams for his case study, a company which sacked its workers by email, stripped its Irish operation of all its assets, tried to do a moonlight flit and pay its workers nothing, and then reopened 122 stores across the water, keeping the extremely profitable online business going, and still refusing to pay its workers a single red cent.<\/p>  <p>  This motion is not just about the role of Debenhams.  It is also about the role of Government and the State.  The House will be aware that the State has a 14% stake in Bank of Ireland and that Bank of Ireland is part of the consortium of banks which forced the closure of the 11 Irish stores.  The State also has its liquidation laws, framed by Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which fix the liquidation process and make it a rigged game, and force the workers down near the back of the payout queue.  The workers understand full well that playing the liquidation game by the rules as they are laid down will in this instance leave them with nothing but the bare statutory minimum payments.  That is why they are correctly and on the basis of a 97% strike mandate refusing to play by the rules of the game, blocking the removal of stock from the stores and taking the position that they will only allow stock leave when a just settlement is put in place for the workers.  Where are we now?  It is a Mexican stand-off.  The liquidator cannot get the stock out of the shops and no end of threats, whether it be injunctions or anything else, will change that basic position.<\/p>  <p>  This is a stalemate which I believe can only now be broken by Government intervention.  The Government, led by the new Taoiseach, says there is very little it can do but it is contradicted by no less a source than the liquidator himself.  Last Wednesday night, the RT&Eacute; website published an article about the Debenhams dispute and in the article it quoted extensively from the liquidator.  Among other statements he stated: \"Unless the State voluntarily instructs the liquidator to allocate supplementary cash to the workers, there is nothing that can be done\".  To be clear, he is not saying that there is nothing that can be done.  He is saying that there is one thing that can be done and one thing only, that is, for the State to give an instruction.<\/p>  <p>  The State is owed many millions of euro from the liquidation process - &euro;5 million for the Revenue, unpaid rates, etc.  The State should use its leverage through Bank of Ireland to force a rethink on Debenhams UK about the four weeks' redundancy, but if it cannot succeed in doing that, the Government must then resolve the issue itself by issuing the necessary instruction.  Furthermore, there must never again be a scandal such as that we see at Debenhams or the one we saw in Clerys just five years ago.  Legislation is urgently needed to protect workers' rights in liquidation situations.  Companies must be prevented from putting all their assets into one company, keeping it open and then, having split the company, putting all its losses into another and shutting it down.  Companies must be prevented from going into liquidation during lockdowns and workers must no longer be put down near the back of the queue in a liquidation situation.  Instead, they must be top of the list.<\/p>  <p>  I made some points earlier about the corporate personality of Debenhams.  I want to make a point about the personality of the Debenhams workers whom I have met and got to know over the past 15 weeks.<\/p> <p>I have been an activist in the working class movement in this country for 40 years.  My experience is that many of the best qualities and characteristics of working-class people emerge in times of collective struggle - determination to fight injustice, solidarity among those who have been robbed and a sense of humour.  I have seen these qualities in abundance among the women on the Debenhams picket lines.  I saw them in the workers on Henry Street who had done a night shift.  They used their social media outlets to help a man who visited their picket line to find his son, who he said had fallen on hard times and gone missing in the inner city.  They were successful in helping that man.<\/p> <p> I have seen those qualities in the Debenhams workers in Cork.  They made a marvellous gesture of solidarity with their fellow workers in Bangladesh, who have been cast aside and thrown into poverty by the company.  The workers in Cork set up a fundraising campaign and raised more than &euro;15,000 for those workers.  I could go on.  These women deserve fair play.  They deserve justice.  They deserve a clear-cut decision and a clear vote from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with no ifs, ands, buts or amendments designed to wreck the motion.  That is what they deserve when we debate this motion tonight and vote on it tomorrow evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200054#GGG00200","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595436900,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;extends its sympathy to the employees of Debenhams Ireland who have lost their jobs given the liquidation of the company;<br \/><br \/>acknowledges the distress and worry that this is causing for employees of Debenhams Ireland, and the added difficulty at the present time when mobility remains restricted;<br \/><br \/>notes that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; Debenhams Ireland is undergoing a court-supervised liquidation, and that the case remains before the High Court and accordingly is <i>sub judice<\/i>;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a company cannot merely assert that it is insolvent, it must apply for an official court liquidation and as such the liquidation will be under the supervision of the Irish courts system;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Companies Act 2014 already provides for a court power to order the return of assets improperly transferred in appropriate cases;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Workplace Relations Commission continues to be fully operational and available to any interested parties who may require it;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s job loss protocol has been activated for employees of Debenhams Ireland putting in place all available supports and information for workers, including on welfare entitlements, job-search assistance and upskilling needs and opportunities;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in respect of redundancy entitlements, it is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to pay statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements to eligible employees;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Social Insurance Fund provides an important safety net for employees in situations where the employer cannot pay statutory redundancy due to financial difficulties or insolvency; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the State will guarantee statutory employment rights to the workers of Debenhams; <\/blockquote>recalls that in response to concerns in earlier cases, the then Government, in 2016, commissioned two reports in parallel: the 'Expert Examination and Review of Laws on the Protection of Employee Interests when assets are separated from the operating entity (Duffy-Cahill Report)' in March 2016, and the report of the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) on 'Protection of Employees and Unsecured Creditors' in June 2017;<br \/><br \/>recognises the need for the Government to have a strong focus on job creation, training and reskilling in the July Stimulus announcement and forthcoming National Economic Plan, given the number of people whose employment has been threatened or lost as a result of the Covid-19 public health emergency;<br \/><br \/>further notes that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation will meet with Debenhams worker representatives; and<br \/><br \/>endorses the intention to immediately commence the Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding employee protections by: <blockquote> \t&mdash; reviewing whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies effectively protect the rights of workers;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; reviewing the Companies Act 2014, with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property, with the result being the trading business (including the jobs) goes into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; examining the legal provision that pertains to any sale to a connected party following the insolvency of a company including who can object and the allowable grounds of an objection.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I welcome this opportunity to discuss these important matters and their impact on more than 1,000 Debenhams workers and their families, as well as the suppliers with stock in those outlets.  The focus of tonight's motion is the employees and everything they have been going through for more than 100 days since they got that devastating news.  We all recognise the very difficult position they are now in.  As a country we are in difficult times.  Among other things, this was one of the first groups of employees to be hit hard by the fallout from Covid-19.  There is recognition throughout the country of their plight.  People support them and there is a great recognition of the important role that those involved in retail have played in recent months.  Most people now have a greater recognition of the service they provide.<\/p><p>I have particular sympathy for the Debenhams employees because I have met a lot of them over the years.  I have shopped there many times myself.  I am not sure about others, but I have certainly been there on many occasions and they always provided a top-class service and were very pleasant people to deal with.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I found the same thing when we had a chance to meet the employees' representatives and some of the employees themselves.  We met Ms Valerie Conlon and Ms Carol Quinn earlier today.  As some of the Deputies have mentioned already, both Valerie and Carol have been working there for decades.  Valerie worked there for 24 years and Carol, who is herself from Cork, has been there for more than 30 years.  They are very committed.<\/p><p>Those representatives put the case very strongly today and we had a very successful and solutions-focused meeting to discuss what we can and cannot do.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I listened to them intently.  We were very pleased to meet them and understand where they are coming from.  We want to see what the Government can do in response and how the legislation can work for them, or in some cases cannot work.<\/p><p>I wish to express my sympathy and that of my Government colleagues for those Debenhams employees and for all those who have lost their jobs as a result of this.  We all recognise that Debenhams staff have given loyal service for many decades.  It is an awful shame that this has happened to them.  Today one could see the pain they are going through.  Having given such loyalty, they really feel let down.  We also got that sense from the workers we met before today.  It could be seen in their eyes that they felt totally let down after giving dedicated service for many years.  It is important that we have this conversation to see how we can help them.  We must focus on solutions.<\/p><p>We recognise that this is a difficult situation for them and their families.  I am acutely aware of the timing of this, occurring as it has during the Covid-19 pandemic, a difficult time for many people in the country.  The Government is working in a co-ordinated way to support everyone who faces the prospect of losing his or her job and all of those who have already lost their jobs in recent months.  The job loss response protocol was immediately activated for the employees of Debenhams.  This brings together all available supports and information for them, including information on welfare entitlements, job search assistance and upskilling opportunities.  It is important that this work continues even though a discussion is ongoing.  The workers have their own picket, but it is important that all the Departments and agencies of the State step up immediately and do their jobs as quickly as they possibly can.<\/p><p>Regarding job losses and efforts to sustain businesses more broadly, it is hoped the Government will publish the July stimulus plan this week.  That will strengthen the Government's effort to save and create jobs and save businesses on behalf of the taxpayers of this country.  As outlined in the programme for Government, the July stimulus will be followed in October by the national economic plan, which will be published on the same day as the budget.  Many colleagues of all parties will feed into that.  They have already contributed suggestions and ideas for legislation as well as for the July stimulus plan to be announced this week.  In October, we will set out a long-term approach to restoring employment and the economy.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for employment affairs and retail businesses, I am quite clear about the serious situation that sector will be in.  It has gone through as difficult a time as any sector in this country, with many changes affecting it.  That has now become a lot more serious.  We have a lot of work to do where the retail sector is concerned.  We must work with the sector, its representative bodies and its employees.  It is a very important sector with great opportunities, on which we must expand.<\/p><p>All of these economic initiatives must be centred around employment, retaining jobs wherever we can, creating new ones to replace jobs that might be lost, and providing a strong focus on quality employment with good terms, conditions and work-life balance.  The qualifications and retail excellence built up by someone who has worked for more than 30 years were quite clear from today's meeting with the Debenhams employees.  They have a skill that is transferable to many other sectors.  I have previously been a Minister of State with responsibility for skills, research and innovation.  I am keenly aware of the skills of those working in the retail sector.<\/p><p>I recognise that the workers of Debenhams have immediate questions and concerns on the redundancy payments they will receive as a result of the liquidation of this company.  Again, we met officially with the representatives of the Debenhams workers to hear their views and concerns.  It was clear to us from that discussion that the engagement between the liquidator, the company and the union representing employees has not yet concluded.  They are working very closely together, having engaged in previous situations.  It is important to note that the State will ensure that the statutory employment rights of the Debenhams are recognised.  There is quite strong legislation behind that, as we discussed here last week.  The information and customer service of the Workplace Relations Commission can provide information on employment rights and equality and industrial relations matters.  That body provides a very good service.  I also recognise that the Debenhams liquidation is court supervised and remains before the High Court.  These legal proceedings will need to conclude and it is essential that nothing prejudicial is said here tonight.  We have borne that in mind when moving the Government's amendment.  The resources available for distribution towards debts owed to employees and to other creditors, including State creditors, have not yet been confirmed by the liquidator.  This is work is ongoing.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that this is an exceptionally difficult situation for Debenhams employees and for the many small business owners who are suppliers to the company and have stock tied up in this.  The Debenhams employees and their union recognise those concerns also.  They are waiting for answers and are understandably concerned.  Anybody running a small business now is in a difficult situation.  I am aware that the Debenhams employees have raised the issue of collective redundancies.  The redundancy payments to be made to employees in a collective redundancy situation are a matter between an employer and employees in the first instance.  The employees had negotiated additional terms for themselves in recent years, and rightly so.  However, the Social Insurance Fund provides a safety net for employees in situations where an employer cannot pay statutory redundancy payments due to financial difficulties or insolvency.<\/p><p>Several legitimate questions about the rights of employees when a company goes into liquidation have been raised tonight and in recent weeks.  These are particularly pressing issues given the number of people whose employment has been threatened or lost as a result of the Covid-19 public health emergency.  Responding to this, the Government made several important commitments in the programme for Government.  Specifically, the Government will review whether the current legal provisions on collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies effectively protect the rights of workers; review the Companies Act 2014 with a view to addressing the practice of companies splitting their operations in advance of an insolvency so that the assets are taken from the original business; and examine the legal provisions around sales to a connected party following an insolvency, including who is entitled to object.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste and the Department are asking the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, to examine these matters as a matter of priority.  That work has been ongoing for some time.<\/p> <p>When it concludes, the Government will be ready to act and to propose legislation where it can achieve improvements.<\/p> <p> It has been noted that the Duffy Cahill report of 2017 made a number of recommendations on the protection of employee interests, with a focus on specific cases where interests are separated from the operating company.  That report was sought by the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Nash, when they were in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Company Law Review Group also made recommendations in 2017 regarding the protection of employees and other unsecured creditors.  Both of those sets of recommendations will be reconsidered as part of the work the Government is commencing.  It is important work, not least given the more difficult economic conditions we face and the unwelcome prospect of more business failures and job losses into the future.<\/p> <p> It is necessary and right that we look to see how the statutory framework can be improved to better protect workers' rights, as the Government is doing.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that we have a strong legal framework for dealing with insolvency, and it includes provisions to deal with improper actions.  Under the Companies Act 2014, a company cannot merely assert that it is insolvent.  It must apply for an official court liquidation, which will be under the supervision of the High Court.  The Companies Act provides, in section 608, that liquidators or creditors of an insolvent company can, in appropriate cases, obtain a court power to order the return of assets which have been improperly transferred.  The Act also provides, under section 559, that a related company may be required to contribute to the payment of debts owed by the company being wound up.  These and other statutory provisions, and the associated civil and criminal penalties, provide an important deterrent to improper actions by companies facing an insolvency.  It is worth recalling that the Duffy Cahill report found that \"the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 that are already available do not appear to be in need of amendment, but more in need of use\".<\/p> <p> As I have outlined, there is a strong and comprehensive statutory framework already in place for dealing with insolvency.  No such framework can be a panacea for the cost of business failure for workers and other debtors, including other businesses, but the legal framework does provide clear remedies and sanctions where there is illegal conduct, as well as rights and protections for employees where collective redundancies are in view.  By way of the commitments in the programme for Government, we will be looking to see how and where this framework can be further improved for workers, and we will consult all Members in this regard.  Across all fronts, the Government will maintain a strong focus on job creation, training and reskilling in the July stimulus and the forthcoming national economic plan.  These are the Government's priorities and commitments to workers at Debenhams and across our economy.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200055#HHH00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595437500,"counter":439,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's response to our motion and the Government's amendment to it are an insult.  The amendment is an insult to the workers who have been taking action for 104 days.  What the Minister of State has offered is more tea, sympathy, crocodile tears and generalities about what the Government is going to do for workers in the future and what it is going to do in terms of legislation.  There is nothing - not a word - about what it is going to do for the workers who are facing this crisis right now, as set out in our motion that supports them.  The Minister of State said one thing that I agreed with, which is that these workers really feel let down.  That is correct, but they feel let down not only by the company but also by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's hypocrisy in this matter is utterly sickening.  I participated in a Zoom call with the Taoiseach, before he assumed office, and some of the Debenhams workers six or eight weeks ago.  I stood in front of Leinster House with Debenhams workers when they met with the Taoiseach, before he was Taoiseach.  Just like on that Zoom call, he nodded knowingly and sympathetically and said he appreciated their circumstances and would do what he could to help them.  I was on a protest and picket line last Saturday with a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy who was presumably there to support the workers.  Now, however, when the Government is being asked to do something to support them, it is not willing to do anything.  Nothing whatsoever is being offered, only a continuation of the empty crocodile tears, tea and sympathy.  The hypocritical behaviour of Government party Members pretending to support those workers when in opposition, as we saw with the Taoiseach before he took office, compared with their behaviour now they are in government is utterly disgusting.  They are saying now that there is nothing they can do and, in so doing, they are implicitly and in effect backing the company.  It is a disgrace.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that such situations are a matter between the employer and the employee in the first instance.  For how long does the first instance go on in this case?  When the workers have been out for 15 weeks, are we not beyond the first instance?  Are we not into a situation where the State must act to avoid workers being treated in this scandalous way and to avoid a green light being given to every other company in the country to do exactly the same?  Will the Government continue to sit on its hands and allow workers to be treated in this way?<\/p>  <p>  I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber on Tuesday when another issue was raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, in response to which the Taoiseach was at pains to say that the Deputy was always saying the Government is about businesses.  His Government is not about the businesses, the Taoiseach told us, but about the workers.  He really emphasised that.  This evening, however, when the Government has a very simple chance to do something for a group of workers who are being treated abysmally by their employer, it is not going to do anything about it.  I say the Government is not about the workers.  It is about big businesses and facilitating legislation that allows big businesses to get away with murder.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is that the law is allowing Debenhams to proceed with what is clearly a tactical insolvency.  The company is abusing the laws that exist in this country to load the debt of the overall operation onto Debenhams in Ireland and then walk away.  The assets are effectively going to the British operation while the debts sit with the Irish side, meaning the workers, in effect, get nothing from the company.  At the same time, the Minister of State tells us he is preparing, in the autumn, to cut the pandemic unemployment payment of these workers, for whom he says he can do nothing, from &euro;350 to &euro;300.  If the Government gets away with that, it will cut the payment to &euro;250 and, after that, it will be down to jobseeker's benefit and means testing.  That is the attitude of this Government to workers.<\/p>  <p>  What is happening in this case demonstrates a lot about the nature of the establishment political parties and who they represent, which is big business and the 1%.  It demonstrates a lot, as Deputy Barry has explained well, about the real character of corporations and how all the talk about multiple stakeholders and caring about society is nonsense.  These companies care only about their profits and they are willing to throw their own workers, who have been loyal to them for decades, onto the scrapheap to maximise those profits.  What is happening also says a lot about the State machinery in this country.  The recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report were not implemented and these companies are legally able to operate in this way because the State machinery also operates in the interests of the 1% of big business and big corporations in this country.  To me, it makes a general point about the need to end this sort of State machinery, to have a State machinery that operates in the interests of ordinary workers, to have an economy that is owned and controlled by ordinary workers and to put people's needs first so that these sorts of behaviours do not happen over and over again, as is, unfortunately, likely to happen in the coming weeks, months and years as the economic crisis deepens.<\/p>  <p>  One very important thing stands between Debenhams, the Government, the State machinery and what they all want to achieve, which is for the workers to go away, do nothing about the abysmal way they have been treated and accept their fate.  Standing in the way of this are the heroic workers who have taken action, who sit on 24-hour pickets in Tallaght, Cork, on Henry Street and all around the country to stop the stock being taken out.  This is a fight for all workers.  The picket lines at Debenhams shops throughout the country are the front line of a struggle about who is going to pay for the coronavirus and who is going to pay for the economic crisis that is coming.  Are companies, the Government and the State machinery going to succeed in loading that cost onto workers and making those workers pay or will the Debenhams workers succeed in forcing the company and the State machinery, at the very least, to pay something towards their redundancy?  If there was any justice in the world, this would be a battle to ensure the company is taken into public ownership and that the jobs continue because they are needed for society.<\/p> <p>I have confidence in the power of the workers to achieve that.<\/p> <p> The workers are creating history through the action they are taking.  If they score an important albeit partial victory, and I think they can, it will be a reference point in the months and years to come.  When H&amp;M workers or other retail workers are faced by a company taking similar action or by a jobs massacre, which is what is coming, they will ask each other whether they remember what happened in the case of the Debenhams workers.  They stood up together, they fought and they won something.  Bob Crow, the former leader of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers in Britain, who tragically died, said that if a person does not fight, he or she cannot win.  If a person fights, he or she has at least a chance of winning.  That is currently being demonstrated by the Debenhams workers.<\/p> <p> Workers generally, trade unionists and those on the left - those who truly support these workers rather than pretending to support them as is done by Fianna F&aacute;il and others - need to be mobilised to join the picket lines to defend the stock and prevent the liquidators from removing it.  A victory for the Debenhams workers will be a victory for all workers.  However, a defeat for them would be a defeat for all workers.  We need to redouble our efforts and the pressure we are exerting.<\/p> <p> It is clear that the Government will vote down the motion tomorrow.  That is fine.  The workers have seen it all before.  They have seen the behaviour of the Government and they will not be demoralised by it.  We need to continue to build the pressure, to put it up to the liquidators, the State and Debenhams and ask them whether they will try to get the stock past workers' pickets.  To achieve that, we need to establish a broad support group involving other trade unionists and left organisations.  The workers will have the final say on what happens in the context of the conduct of their strike, but involving those different groups would facilitate having the maximum number of people on the picket lines and build towards a substantial demonstration to show the broad public support that exists.<\/p> <p> The Government can use and abuse its majority in the House, as it did in the context of the Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform earlier, but can it defeat the workers?  Can it force the stock through a line of militant workers and their supporters who refuse to accept that being done?  This is the front line.  It is a question of who will pay.  The Debenhams workers are leading the way.  I salute them for saying that workers should not pay for the coronavirus and economic crisis.  Rather, we should make the companies pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595438100,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for tabling the motion.  I wish to salute the Debenhams workers and their representatives from Mandate Trade Union.  It is not lost on these or any other workers that the Government gets excited, interested and passionate about particular things.  Its members get very passionate about money for themselves.  The Cabinet happily debated legislation which would give the super junior Ministers a few more bob.  That is not lost on people.  They know what is going on.  They see who the members of Government are, how they behave and what is important to them.  Workers' rights are not important to the Government, but that does not matter because workers' rights are important.  They are important to Sinn F&eacute;in and other Opposition Deputies.  We will ensure that workers such as the Debenhams workers are not forgotten or left behind.  That must not be allowed to happen.  It is not a good look for the Government when there are newspaper reports revealing that the Cabinet discussed another pay increase for people who are already very well paid.  It is not a good look for the Government when Ministers are squabbling over which of them will be allocated an aide-de-camp or another Garda driver.  Government party Deputies have expressed their disappointment at not being chosen to take a step up.  None of them referred to ability.  None of them stated that they wanted the job because they could do it better than anyone else or they could bring particular qualities to it.  Rather, they spoke of their region, town or parish being disappointed.  None of them referred to merit.  That is not lost on people.  They see what is important to the Government.  The job of the Opposition is to put the case for the workers to the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the workers have 34 years of service.  Workers who have spent 34 years working side by side have been through everything together.  They probably saw each other off to get married and welcomed each other back from maternity or paternity leave.  They went to each others' engagement parties.  They have shown each other photographs of their children or grandchildren.  They have worked together for 34 years.<\/p>  <p>  The workers operated under a collective agreement.  Deputies are covered by collective agreements that are honoured by our employer.  The Debenhams workers negotiated their collective agreement.  Anyone who has negotiated such an agreement, as I have, will know that they always involve compromise.  I acknowledge that some Deputies do not like the word \"compromise\", but it is exactly what is needed to negotiate a collective agreement.  There is give and take.  The workers gave, but now they see that their collective agreement is worthless.  We must not just shrug our shoulders.  We have seen situations such as this before.  I refer to Clery's, TalkTalk, La Senza, Paris Bakery and now Debenhams.  Every time it happens, there is collective agreement that somebody should do something and that it must not be allowed to happen again.  We must draw a line in the sand.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in previously tabled legislation that was not opposed by the two big parties that are in Government together.  I have sought leave to introduce legislation on this issue.  I sincerely hope that when leave to introduce it is granted, those parties will not oppose its passage but rather work with us to ensure that it is passed and in order that we do not find ourselves back here discussing a similar situation and having to shrug our shoulders to another group of workers, tell them it is terrible and offer an apology.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, we need to back the workers, work with them and do all we can.  That means the Government must do all it can to ensure the workers get a resolution to their dispute.  A ballot is required to take industrial action and only a ballot will conclude it.  The workers will only accept a ballot that they deem fair and just.  No industrial action goes on forever.  I am sure the past 104 days feels like forever for the Debenhams workers, who are mostly women.  It has been a very long time in unprecedented circumstances, but they are strong and determined.  We must be equally strong and determined to ensure that we do right by them and that we use whatever power and influence we have and whatever mechanism is at our disposal to ensure that a satisfactory resolution to their dispute is found such that they can ballot to end the industrial action, get what they are entitled to and move on.<\/p>  <p>  We do not need more reports or reviews.  Although I am currently speaking to the motion, we do not need more talk on this issue.  We know what needs to be done.  The current situation is just not right.  I salute the workers.  They are on the picket lines 24 hours a day to try to keep the stock in those stores because that is all they have left.  The message is clear.  They have significant public support.  They are incredibly determined and they will see this dispute out to the end.  I call on the Government to do all in its power to assist with the dispute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200057#KKK00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1595438100,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Barry, who tabled the motion.  There are 480 Debenhams workers and concession workers in Patrick Street, Cork who have lost their jobs and another 250-plus workers in Mahon Point who were told by email that there jobs were gone.  The behaviour of Debenhams Ireland and its parent company in the UK is nothing short of scandalous.  If we do not draw a line in the sand for these and for other workers, we will be failing them.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, the workers asked me to put their voice forward here today and let other Deputies know what they are feeling.  They stated that in these unprecedented times and in the context of companies going into liquidation, there should be a longer period during which people can make proposals, look into the situation and challenge the liquidation.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the issue of the Government getting revenue back from the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200057#KKK00300","speaker":"1453"}]
