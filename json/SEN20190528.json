I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this matter which has been raised in this House many times, namely, the terms and conditions for local public representatives.  I thank all my Seanad colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il for supporting this important matter.  Following the local elections, I congratulate all those who were successful in election to local authorities to represent their communities and constituents for the next five years.  What concerns me and many of my colleagues is that they are not adequately resourced or compensated for the enormous job they have to do.<\/p> <p>There were 1,627 councillors at the election previous to the 2014 election, but going into the 2014 election we were down 678 councillors.  We have the lowest public representation per head in the European Union, worse than the United Kingdom which is second lowest.  Our figure is one representative for every 4,000 people where the United Kingdom has a representative for every 2,000 people.  In France, which is the best, there is one public representative for every 78 citizens.  This shows the scale of the gulf between what other European countries do and what we do in Ireland.  That is bad enough but the powers given to public representatives at local authority level are the lowest in Europe.  The responsibilities given to councillors are the worst in Ireland of all EU states.  They must look after more constituents than anywhere else while central government has taken more and more powers and decisions away from them, year in, year out.<\/p> <p>The consequence, as we have seen in the local elections, is that some areas had few candidates.  In one area, only two candidates were not elected.  Many constituencies had 19 and 20 people running for seven seats but in many areas parties  - Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in and the rest - struggled to find candidates.  Many conventions were not contested because the workload increased while the amount of money that councillors are given and the supports they are given did not.  Some councils have secretarial supports for local representatives but this is not uniform, and it must be made so.  There have been various proposals.  We are anxious to see the report which was supposed to come out at the beginning of the year but has not.  Clearly, no one on the Government side wanted it to be published prior to the elections as it might dissuade more people from running.  Many people who did not know what the future would hold have decided not to run again.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State say what is the Government's plan?  Why has it not published the report?  I hope that when it is released, the Minister will debate it in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  At the next local election and the one after that in ten years, there could be entire local electoral areas where there will be no contest.  We will be looking for people to run at local authority level.  Not only are people struggling because they cannot get supports from the Government and they are not adequately compensated but also they do not have the power that they should have and that other countries give to their local authority members, and that has to be addressed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> It is a two issue problem.  The terms and conditions are important because, as the country reaches full employment, people will have more demands on their time and they will not be able to give the time.  I note that the survey, which was one of the reasons given for a delay in publishing this report, was based on the previous set of councillors.  While many of them have been re-elected, we need to look to the future.  As the Minister of State and the Government are well aware, the concern is that very soon we will not have enough people going forward for local elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#B00500","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I usually do not make a comment, but as a former local authority member, I wish to acknowledge the great effort by people who put their names forward for election.

I thank him for raising the issue which is very important.  It is certainly timely given that we have more or less completed all the counts of the local elections.  I congratulate all those who were successful in winning a seat in recent days.  I commiserate with and thank all those who ran but were not successful.  Many knew it might have been difficult to start out in their first campaign.  The majority have to run once or twice to become councillors and they should not lose hope.  It is a big deal for people to decide to put their names forward in a public contest and face public scrutiny.  We all know now that politics has changed considerably, with the scrutiny of people's work, their families' work, their background, history and so forth.  It is a big deal to agree to run.  It is great when it works out and one wins, but it can be hard for those who lose.  I again thank all the candidates because democracy is very important.  We fought hard for it and it is important for us to respect that at every opportunity.<\/p> <p>I note all the young people present and it is great to see so many young candidates becoming involved.  A big issue in the campaign was climate change, and that agenda was certainly driven by the young people in Ireland and across Europe, and rightly so.  I congratulate them on doing that as it means they are also involved in politics from a very young age.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I are very passionate about local government.  As a Minister of State in the Department looking after local government and electoral reform, I want to ensure that the critical role of local councillors is clearly defined and fairly remunerated.  Everybody recognises the pressures on that job and the long hours the majority of councillors put in over many days a week.  It has been well commented on here.<\/p> <p>I am strongly of the view that councillors must be appropriately supported and that they need to carry out their work effectively and to the highest standards of integrity, transparency and accountability.  To do that they need to be well remunerated and well supported throughout the system.  To that end and taking on board significant concerns raised by councillors and in debates in this House regarding the current remuneration regime, we agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to commission a review of the role and remuneration of councillors.<\/p> <p>On 21 June, 2018, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, appointed Ms Sara Moorhead SC to carry out an independent review.  Ms Moorhead has consulted widely with local authority elected members and their representative organisations, political parties, local authority chief executives and other appropriate stakeholders.  Ms Moorhead submitted an interim report to the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, which was published in November 2018.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was necessary to survey all local authority members and to seek financial information from all local authorities to progress towards the final report.  The survey has now been completed and the financial data collected.  In both cases, deadline extensions were granted to allow sufficient time for comprehensive responses to be made.  The delays were not of the Government's making but were due to requests and to ensure all the responses would be received in time.  The drafting of the final report is progressing well and the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, expects to receive it shortly.<\/p><p>Following the necessary consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the review will be submitted to Government in due course and published thereafter.  The review will more comprehensively define the role of councillor.  This informs the examination of the current system of remuneration for councillors, with a view to proposals for a remuneration package that is modernised and representative of, and commensurate with, the role.  Supports to councillors of a non-remuneration nature are also considered and are important, as Senator Daly noted.<\/p><p>Recognising that immediate action was required, and separate to the review, we have made a range of improvements to the supports provided to councillors, although we know they are only a step in the right direction.  These include providing for a new allowance for councillors of &euro;1,000 per annum, backdated to 1 July 2017, in recognition of the additional workload following the 2014 reforms and the greater areas being covered.  Certainly, massive areas have to be covered in counties such as Mayo, Roscommon or Kerry, which is well recognised.  We also introduced new optional vouched expenses of up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per annum, which councillors may opt for in place of the existing unvouched allowance of up to &euro;2,500 per annum.  That has worked out quite well for many councillors, who are able to spend that money wisely on the supports they need to be able to do their job.  In addition, the representational payment paid to councillors, which is linked to a Senator&rsquo;s salary, was increased to &euro;17,060 per annum with effect from 1 October 2018.  I understand it is to be increased further in line with adjustments arising from the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.<\/p><p>I welcome the continued interest of Seanad Members in this matter and I thank the Senator for placing it on today&rsquo;s agenda.  I confirm that the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, will brief him further once the report is finalised and published in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#C00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Russian Delegation","time":1559050200,"counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#D00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome to the House the Russian delegation from the State Duma, who are most welcome to our country.

In fact, we are being very proactive in trying to give back powers.  If the Senator had been here for most of the debate on the planning Bill last year, he would know that we gave back powers to councils.  We have enhanced their powers because planning is a major function of councillors, among many others.  I was first elected to sit on a council in 1999, 20 years ago, as a 21 year old.  I watched councillors who did not always want to use powers they had, some of which have been eroded in the past 20 years.  I am certainly a believer in giving councillors the powers they need to do their job.  I ask all councillors, particularly new councillors, to use their powers and take them seriously and realise the opportunities they have.  They are the directors of the companies that run their counties and have a lot of powers.  I often hear councillors tell me that they do not have powers.  I stress to the Senator that they have a lot of powers under legislation that they do not get to use very often, but they should use them.  If they work collectively as a group, they will be able to do so.  We will find ways to give them back more powers.  That is why votes were held in three local authority areas on directly elected mayors to try to give back decision-making powers to local areas and drive that agenda.  I think the Senator supported that process and we will continue with it.  He can rest assured that we believe not only in councillors having powers but also in their using them responsibly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#E00500","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","time":1559050200,"counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#E00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House.  I think we can all agree that there is no one solution to fix the housing shortage problem, as everyone knows.  We need a multifaceted approach and to think outside the box.  Modular builds are part of the solution in the shorter term and, in some cases, the longer term, particularly from the point of view that they can be delivered more quickly than concrete houses - I understand it takes about 18 weeks to build a modular unit - and are substantially cheaper to deliver.  As things stand, in terms of Government policy on housing and planning, we are behind the curve compared with our near neighbour, the United Kingdom, and the United States where modular units built to the highest standards form a significant part of the housing offering.  I say this with particular knowledge of a company operating in my county, Mayo, Big Red Barn, which is going from strength to strength in manufacturing modular units.  It is about to expand its factory in Swinford, in the process doubling its workforce to 65.  It is inundated with demands for its product, modular builds and commercial premises, but its market is predominantly exports to the United Kingdom and the United States where it is enjoying great success and going from strength to strength.<\/p> <p>When people here inquire about modular builds, they find that they run into issues with Government policy which is really geared towards bricks and mortar, not modular builds.  For example - I noted this when I was canvassing with various candidates during the local elections - if one goes out to the countryside one will see substandard housing.  It could be an elderly person or a family living in an overcrowded setting who need additional accommodation.  The provision of a modular unit built to the highest standards in terms of energy efficiency and fire safety would be a very quick solution for them.  When dealing with the local authority, however, it seems that what is obvious and makes common sense in other countries is not acceptable here.  I refer to one-off builds in the countryside, but this could also be applied to town in certain circumstances.  <\/p> <p>Big Red Barn forwarded a proposal to Dublin City Council for a pilot project to deliver social housing.  It was presented to Mr. Brendan Kenny.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Currently, there are no adequate regulations to incentivise accessory dwelling units.  These would allow younger couples who cannot secure loans for the bricks and mortar, cannot get planning permission and are unsure about building regulations to get satisfactory modular builds.

I would like the pilot project to be brought forward as part of the housing solution and as an alternative to family hubs.  We have sites but we need action on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#E00700","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and for giving me an opportunity to clarify the relevant regulations as well as the importance of having modular homes and the use of off-site construction, which is something that our Department is for.  We would like to encourage as many local authorities as possible to use the option of off-site construction, modular housing, rapid build or whatever one would like to call it.  It presents many opportunities and is commonly used in other countries.<\/p> <p>\"Modular housing\", \"rapid build\" and \"off-site construction\" are terms used to describe modern methods of construction.  They are recognised as having an important role to play in speedy delivery, alleviating skills constraints and increasing productivity.  This support is reflected in the development of a number of procurement frameworks of design-build contractors using off-site construction for social housing delivery.<\/p> <p>As part of my Department's social housing capital programme, more than 400 homes had been delivered under the rapid delivery programme to the end of 2018 and more than 200 more will be delivered across ten projects this year, with more to follow from next year onwards.  I was on three sites in recent weeks that were being developed under the rapid build framework.<\/p> <p>To support rapid delivery housing, the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, put in place a framework of rapid delivery contractors in 2017, which is available to all local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs.  My Department has organised information seminars as well as visits to rapid delivery projects under construction in order to support the roll-out of the programme.  Local authorities do not have to use this framework and can engage other providers of off-site construction.  However, we are trying to encourage the use of this option.  At the workshops, we sit down with the people involved in housing and planning and encourage them to consider this sector as an opportunity for building houses.  We are open to that.  It is not a case of us shutting out modular homes.<\/p> <p>Many of the issues around delivery that standard social housing construction projects face are also faced by rapid build projects, for example, preparing sites, services, access, community consultation and planning.  However, there are savings in terms of the design and construction and these advantages are growing as more use is made of the OGP framework.  We have tried to intervene in planning timelines.  We have cut down the time it takes a project to get from greenfield site to building stage.  It used to take three, four or five years but that has been cut down to approximately 59 weeks.  That is the target.  In the majority of cases, the period is approximately 61 weeks.  We are getting to site much quicker, and off-site construction can deliver housing more quickly from that point.  A figure of eight weeks is often cited but that does not include all of the time needed to get a site valuation, planning permission, etc.  Once a contract is up and running, a house can be built quite quickly using this system.  I have been in the factories and have seen this.<\/p> <p>In addition, Dublin City Council is developing a volumetric rapid delivery programme of apartment developments.  A procurement framework of design-build contractors for the delivery of these units will be in place by the end of next month and will be available to all local authorities and AHBs to use.  It is envisaged that over 1,000 fast-track homes will be built using this framework, the majority of which will be in Dublin, but there will also likely be schemes in other cities and towns.<\/p> <p>It is important to bear in mind the related development of the energy performance of buildings directive, EPBD, which sets ambitious goals for energy efficiency and renewables in buildings by requiring nearly zero-energy building, NZEB, performance for new buildings from 31 December 2020.  The NZEB process aligns closely with off-site construction, with scope for more robust quality assurance processes to be developed in factory environments.  Greater consistency can be achieved in the construction of individual elements and indoor fabrication is not affected by weather.  Off-site manufacturing also has many benefits in reducing construction waste and the environmental impacts of construction.<\/p> <p>Regarding building standards, as well as off-site construction providing many benefits in terms of delivery and affordability, we will also ensure that it continues to provide sustainable and durable housing.  All new dwellings must comply with the building regulations and building control requirements and achieve a 60-year durability for all key elements.  They should be built with quality materials that are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.  In many cases, the conditions that must be met in Ireland differ from those in other countries but we have regulations.  With my officials, I have met numerous producers of all different types of housing at the Department, in Leinster House and at many conferences.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am familiar with the company mentioned by the Senator and I visited its stand at the ploughing championships.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, visited as well.  We would be happy to engage with the company with respect to Irish regulations but I want to be very clear.  We have strict regulations for housing in Ireland because we want high-quality social housing provision as well as private housing.  The Senator is very familiar with the difficulties that have arisen in Mayo with poor quality in housing because of mica and pyrite.  Part of my job is dealing with housing that was built poorly over the years.  We cannot go back to that.  We have regulations that are there for good reason, but when many of the providers engage with us, we find ways to explain where they might fail because of these regulations and how they may need to work on that.  We are happy to engage in that respect.<\/p><p>The performance requirements of buildings and works are set out in the second schedule to the building regulations.  They are written in broad terms and do not refer to materials or methodologies.  Certain materials, methods of construction, standards and other specifications, including technical specifications, are referred to in the technical guidance documents that accompany the regulations, but the adoption of approaches other than those outlined in the guidance is not precluded provided that the relevant requirements of the regulations are complied with.  We are not for or against any method of construction once it meets regulations and gives people a quality home that will stand the test of time and the conditions we have in this country as well.  Where works involve products, materials, techniques or equipment for which published national standards do not yet exist, third-party certification can demonstrate compliance with Irish building regulations and durability requirements.  Such certification may include, in part or in total, a European technical assessment or agr&eacute;ment certification or equivalent.  This is key to ensuring minimum quality and durability standards are met and providing confidence to investors, construction industry professionals, builders and, importantly, the consumer, especially in the context of the building defects and building system failures that have arisen in the past.  Local authorities rely on these certificates to give the guarantee that the quality product will provide a proper home for people who want to live there.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to work with local authorities, the construction industry and all other stakeholders to support the rolling out of modern methods of construction in a manner that delivers high-quality homes efficiently and at a good price for the taxpayer and consumer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#F00200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I agree with respect to standards and we know that sometimes the lack of standards, even in the private sector, can come back to bite the Government, because the person who buys a house or has it built may lose out.

Notwithstanding the modular build not being precluded, there seems to be a lack of clarity around what is allowed.  The Minister of State did not specifically address the issue of accessory dwellings, which could see an independent unit built on an existing site as a shorter-term solution.  We are talking about 10,000 homeless people.  The Minister of State mentioned the rapid delivery programme, but those are modest numbers in that context.  Does the Minister of State envision more development of accessory dwelling units, both in country areas and in towns where there is a site big enough within the proper rules and health safety regulations?

Any company producing housing is more than welcome to come into my office and meet officials to go through the product and what must be done to meet the standards.

I also welcome the opportunity to address the House on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Health and I fully acknowledge the distress overcrowded emergency departments, EDs, cause to patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging working conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  The number of patients attending emergency departments continues to increase year on year.  In the first quarter of 2019, the number of patients attending hospital emergency departments increased by 7.6% and the number of admissions to EDs increased by 4.7% compared with the same period last year.  University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country and, as such, the hospital and community healthcare organisation, CHO, mid-west were identified as one of the nine focus sites requiring additional investment, focus and support this winter.<\/p> <p>The problem of overcrowding in hospitals requires a full system, patient focused response.  Recognising this, in the winter plan for 2018-19, the HSE sought to maximise the use of existing resources across hospital groups and CHOs to target additional investment at both hospital and community services supports.  The approach adopted by the HSE over the winter period for 2018 and 2019, within the financial and capacity parameters and having taken into account the increased demand, supported an improvement in patient experience and a reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys.  The health service capacity review published last year highlighted the need for investment in additional capacity.  Progress has been made on increasing capacity in UHL.  The average number of open inpatient beds increased by 4% between 2017 and March 2019.  Since 2017, an additional 25 beds have opened in UHL, including eight as part of this year's winter plan.  A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at UHL, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019.  Enabling works commenced in March and the HSE advises that the main works are expected to start in quarter 2.  In addition, the national development plan includes a 96-bed replacement ward block in UHL and capital funding was provided in 2018 to progress the design phase of the project.<\/p> <p>Planning for winter 2019-20 has already commenced.  The HSE is undertaking a review of performance across all hospital groups and CHOs over the winter period to inform planning for next winter.  This review will enable an assessment by the HSE of the overall performance from a planning, implementation and outcome perspective, year on year and against targets.  In addition, it will encompass a review of the relative performance of the hospital group and the CHOs in comparison with other sites.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The HSE advises me that this process will include an independent expert review of clinical, analytical and management capability in UHL and CHO mid-west as well as the other eight focus sites and CHOs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#H00500","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I disagree with and take offence to this comment.  Unionism is unionism and nationalism is nationalism, just as loyalism is loyalism and republicanism is republicanism.  In 1959 Johnny Cash sang about \"Forty Shades of Green\".  I suggest there have always been 40 shades of green.  I also argue that there are 40 shades of orange, all with unique perspectives and points of difference, but unionism, nationalism, loyalism and republicanism have changed and are not as they were ten, 20, 50 or 100 years ago.  They will change further.  Politics needs to acknowledge and reflect this, rather than refer to old-style types and labels.  If we need to take anything from what happened at the weekend, it is that the people of Ireland and the United Kingdom are ahead of their politicians.  The new generation of voters will place higher demands on politicians and leaders to deliver on promises.  As we conclude this round of elections, everybody has a responsibility to reflect on gains and losses, successes and failures and strive to work across both Houses of the Oireachtas to deliver security, peace and prosperity for all the people of Ireland, irrespective of their political affiliations or identity.

On behalf of my own party, the Labour Party, I commend our 111 local election candidates and our three European election candidates in particular.  Labour experienced a significant increase in councillors, with at least 56 and possibly 57 seats at local government level.  Some 42% of our councillors are women, which is a matter of enormous pride.  It is great that more than 200 women were elected as councillors, although the overall proportion of women councillors, which is projected to be approximately 23% following the finalisation of all counts which is still not enough but nonetheless it is an improvement on what went before.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to ensure more is done to encourage and mentor women to run for election to ensure we will see more come through.<\/p><p>I offer particular commendation to the Green Party candidates for their performance.

He raised several issues, all of which I have raised previously and will do so again.  One of them was administrators and civil servants making defence and security decisions and policies.  He likened it to administrators going into an operating theatre in a HSE hospital and performing an operation.  It is not right and does not work.  The same should apply to the Defence Forces.  Administrators should not be making military decisions when they do not have military experience.<\/p> <p>Another issue raised was that of duty pay, another matter I raise in the House on a regular basis.  Some of my friends are on duty for 24 hours at weekends in Custume Barracks in Athlone.  Their gross pay is &euro;2 per hour.  After tax we are talking about a sum of &euro;1 per hour which, as everybody knows, is not the minimum wage.  It is outrageous and should not be allowed to continue.<\/p> <p>The retired commandant also raised the issue of retention.  Approximately &euro;15 million has been spent on the advertising of careers in the Defence Forces.  We should not be spending &euro;15 million on advertising to recruit but to retain what we have, namely, very good experienced soldiers.  It was indicated in the White Paper that we would keep numbers in the Defence Forces at 9,500.  Currently, they are only at 8,900; therefore, that suggestion would help in that regard.<\/p> <p>Another issue that concerns me greatly is that some soldiers are in receipt of family income supplement.

Perhaps we should ask the Minister to send a circular, as he did that time, to each local authority directing it to set up an SPC to cover climate action and climate change.

Many of them made a contribution over a long number of years and contributed not only to the local council but also to their local community.  We must acknowledge their work and their contribution.  I note those who ran at the local elections who were not successful, especially local councillors.  It is a difficult thing for people to face when they lose out on an election.  We should acknowledge their contribution and that of everyone who puts himself or herself forward in the democratic system.<\/p> <p>Irish people have been watching contributions in the House of Commons and wonder how some of these people were ever elected.  At least in the Irish system, if a voter's first preference is not elected, their vote goes on to No. 2, No. 3 or No. 4 and so on down the line.  It is a far better system that we have, even if we might criticise it sometimes.<\/p> <p>I also raise the issues of the Defence Forces and Army pay.  These very much need to be tackled.  As someone who has acted in a legal capacity for members of the Defence Forces over the years, I can recall when someone who worked as an ordinary member of the Defence Forces was able to buy a three-bedroom house.  There is no way now that someone working in the Defence Forces can afford to buy a property on the income he or she earns.  We need to examine this issue and to bring forward serious recommendations that will encourage people to stay on and encourage new people to join.  We are in a position of full employment, where we compete to retain good people in the jobs market.  We must ensure that we pay the appropriate remuneration for the work they are doing.

The report strongly states that they are not benefiting from the economic upturn.  The view of the ombudsman is that the use of words such as \"inclusiveness\" and \"equality\" are little more than lip service.  There are two issues in particular.

It is great to see people who participate in the affairs of Leinster House and are also willing to put their names forward, knowing, as they do, the risks of failure and success.<\/p> <p>I add my voice to what Senator Marshall said about Northern Ireland.  The flag beside you, a Chathaoirligh, the national tricolour, is a flag of green, white and orange.  It is about time that we stopped talking in simply binary terms about demographics and who will be 51% and who will be 49%, when that no longer represents the reality or complexity of Northern Ireland society.<\/p> <p>The Senator arranged a visit for a number of us to Belfast recently.  We visited the mothballed assembly at Stormont.  We received a briefing in a fine chamber, which was the original senate chamber of Northern Ireland.  The thought occurred to us on that occasion that it would enhance the political process in Northern Ireland if there were a civic society, non-confrontational forum in the Northern Ireland parliamentary process as well as the highly numerical and highly polarised assembly elections operating as they do very much on the basis of headcounts of a green and orange kind.<\/p> <p>I congratulate all of the people who were elected to represent Northern Ireland in the European Parliament for however long their term lasts.  It is significant that two out of the three candidates supported remaining in the European Union.  Naomi Long's success, to which reference was just made, symbolises that there is a middle ground in Northern Ireland.  Not everybody is of one shade of orange or green, as Senator Marshall has said.  In that context, in this State we should be much more generous to the orange tradition.  We should acknowledge it.  We have things like the Royal Dublin Society, the Royal Irish Academy, King's Inns and Trinity College.

Unfortunately, we see too many of these shops closed on our main streets, and it is a depressing sight.<\/p> <p>We have to hear the clarion call from multiple retailers and chain stores with the news earlier this week that six of these retailers - Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge and Wallis - are going to close stores here in Ireland, stores are closing in the United Kingdom and it is projected that 200 Boots stores in the UK will close.  This is all on the high street, so it is not just a challenge to independent retailers.

They are on different playing fields.  The shops on our main streets cannot compete.  I have particular sympathy for the small shops and independent retailers.  The bigger shops and multiple retailers will look after themselves and will continue to sell online.  We have to look at the business model, how we levy rates and also the public good and the desirability of maintaining these shops.  We do not want to go into our town centres and be depressed looking at shut-up shops.  If we want them, we have to make some policy changes, and it has to begin with commercial rates.

I am sad to see she has not been re-elected.<\/p> <p>We know it is a really important moment in regard to how this country is going to change over the next decade.  That is what this election shows.  It is a very positive sign that so many people have sent this signal.  They have stated very clearly they want action on climate change and they want it to be a priority.  However, we should also remember that the results this weekend are just the electoral wing of a much bigger social shift.  A huge network of activists and campaigners, both inside and outside the political parties, and, indeed, inside and outside Ireland, have pushed us to this point.  We see the appetite for big, meaningful, radical change to address climate change and to make our country fairer, healthier and more sustainable in the process.<\/p> <p>The results this weekend place a massive amount of trust in politicians, and we have to live up to that.  We need to be bold in our action and resist any attempts to just greenwash or have business as usual.  That is not an option.  Our transition to a climate-friendly country must be rooted in principles of social and economic justice.  The whole movement for a just transition is based on the belief that no one can be left behind and that we cannot let the most marginalised and disadvantaged bear the brunt of these changes as they are already disproportionately bearing the brunt of climate change.  We need to see this as part of the bigger move to make our country fairer and more equal.  I hope the Greens lead the way on this.<\/p> <p>The Government said it has got the message from the public and I sincerely hope this is true.

It should also be made a lot easier for people not registered to vote to do so, besides having to go to the local Garda station.  In some cases, people who are sick must go to the doctor.  A lot of things can be done to make it much easier for many people to vote in elections.  During the meetings of the Seanad reform committee, some of us raised the issue of extending the franchise to everyone in the Republic, Northern Ireland, America and Irish citizens all over the world.

If, for instance, it is determined that we want to appoint two more family law judges, let us say at District Court or Circuit Court level, the present scheme of the Bill does not allow the Government, which is going to take advice from the commission, to tell it that the president of the court is looking for a person most likely to have specialised in family law.  It is for the Government to decide that rather than simply the president of the court himself or herself.  Likewise, if the Government wants more criminal judges, let us say in the Circuit Court, there is no point in having a competition where people who would be family law judges spend hours and hours preparing applications for a particular appointment and behind the scenes it has already been decided at Government level that it is hunting for two extra criminal law judges.  Therefore, what Senators Boyhan and Craughwell and I believe is essential in these circumstances is that the process of advertising a vacancy and interviewing people should not proceed as though replicating the navigation of a submarine without a periscope.  If the name of the game is to get two extra family law judges, why advertise the position to people who would not be interested in being appointed to that particular aspect of the court's business, and <i>vice versa<\/i>, if it is in relation to crime?  If the Government is seeking extra criminal judges, why would people who have no interest whatsoever in criminal law and no record in criminal law feel that they should apply on the basis that this could be a family law vacancy, a civil law vacancy or a refugee law vacancy when the Government is not looking to appoint somebody to such a position?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A deficiency with the Bill at present is that the procedures permit the commission to differentiate between different classes of business to which a judge is likely to be appointed.  It does not allow the Government to say that it is interested in two extra judges, whether criminal, family or bankruptcy judges.  It does not permit the commission, in its advertisements, to say that it is hunting for family law judges so if one does not want to spend one's life doing family law, that person should not apply for this position because he or she will be disappointed because he or she will be sent to do family law work in County Kerry or Limerick.  It seems to me to be common sense that the policy in this regard should be determined by the Government.  The president of a court will frequently say that he or she needs more family law judges and will communicate that to the Minister, saying that the court is sorely pressed in the family law area.  It is for the Government to decide that it is willing to make such extra appointments.  If the Government is so minded, there should be a mechanism to direct the appointments commission to do two things.  It should make it clearly apparent to the would-be applicants what kind of appointment is likely to be made and what kind of specialism is likely to be the subject of the appointment.  It should concentrate its own efforts on getting such a person, which this amendment proposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#FF00700","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I support Senator McDowell in this amendment.

As he rightly says, if there is a vacancy or need for extra judges in the family courts, there is not much point in appointing somebody whose experience is in property and conveyancing, because that person would not have the relevant experience.  I do not anticipate that the Minister will accept this because if he did not accept the amendments which dealt with the question of experience, he is hardly likely to accept this amendment.

I was taking up the phraseology of the draftsman, who I will not criticise in this respect.  It is already part of the Minister's scheme that a particular appointee will be appointed or recommended for appointment on the basis that he or she may be carrying out a different class of business in the court to which he or she is appointed.  That is already there.  It is the Minister's policy.  If the Government wants more family law judges, it is the Minister's and the Government's responsibility to tell the commission that.  It is not trenching on their independence.  It is not their function to determine that there should be a particular balance of judges of one class or another.  It is for the Government of the day to say that it wants more criminal judges and not more family judges, since that court is well enough manned, if I can use that phrase, as things stand.  When setting out a statement of requisite skills and attributes, if one accepts the proposition that the likelihood that a particular appointment will go to a particular division of a particular court, the obvious thing to do before the commission embarks on that task is for the Government to say that it wants the commission to have regard to the fact that we are seeking an extra appointment to deal with family law rather than criminal law.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That would especially take place in the context of what the Minister is doing with expanding the Court of Appeal by a significant number of judges.  If all of the newly-appointed judges under his proposed statutory amendment were on the criminal side, it might be a good thing or it might be a bad thing.  At least, the Government is entitled, especially when increasing the resources of a court, to direct those resources towards a particular end of the courts&rsquo; variety of categories of business.<\/p><p>It is regrettable that it should be stated that this somehow trenches on the independence of the commission.  The commission itself, under section 50(2), has to consider a situation in which it is reasonably anticipated that a particular appointee would be dealing with a particular class of business.  If the Oireachtas decides to appoint five extra judges to the District Court to strengthen its family law side, if that is the purpose of expanding the number of judges in the District Court under legislation, the Government should be entitled to send a totally transparent direction to the commission stating it is appointing these five extra judges and making provision for them in statute on the basis it wants to expand the family law capacity of the District Court.  If that is the Government&rsquo;s intention, it is no imposition on the commission&rsquo;s independence that it should have regard to a direction along those lines given by the Minister.  The Government is not telling the commission who it has to appoint.  It is merely to say that it is interested in family law appointees and that is why it is creating these extra positions.  Could anything be more innocent than that?  Could anything be more reasonable than that?  Could anything be less likely to cause trouble?<\/p><p>I will give the Minister another example.  Supposing it was felt by the Government &ndash; this is not a matter for the Judiciary &ndash; that we needed an extra expert in intellectual copyright, trademark or intellectual property law?  Why should the Government not be in a position to give a direction to the commission to advertise a position on the basis that it wants someone appointed capable of dealing with this area of business?  When one is interviewing them, there is no point in talking to them about their experience in the District Court doing TV licence cases.  This person is going to be a different person altogether.  That is why this amendment is being proposed.<\/p><p>On making such a direction, the amendment proposes that there would be consultation with the members of the various courts involved.  On occasions, the Government may need one trademark or intellectual property judge but, as there is only need for one, will it make it clear in its advertisement?  This will ensure intellectual property lawyers will see one slot go to an intellectual property lawyer and they might as well apply for it.  Otherwise, we will play this ridiculous blind man&rsquo;s buff arrangement that people are putting in applications not knowing what is going on in the minds of the people making the appointment.<\/p><p>Since the principle is already established in section 50(2) that there will be people appointed who in all likelihood will be sent to do particular aspects of the law in a court, I cannot see any argument against this amendment.  The one offered by the Minister that it would trench on the independence of the commission is hardly stateable.  What would be wrong with saying we are creating two extra vacancies and we want one of them to be an intellectual property lawyer who can deal with patent, trademark and copyright cases?  If there is nothing wrong with that, why not state so in the advertisement which the commission puts out?  It can state it received a direction from the Minister that it is its intention to appoint an intellectual property lawyer.  That means that all intellectual property lawyers - solicitors and barristers who specialise in this area - will see this is to what the commission will be addressing its minds.

How is this to be determined?  This is a genuine lacuna.  It is a mistake in the Bill that there is no provision for the Government to make it clear that it wants an intellectual property lawyer and not to put out advertisements to which every specialist in criminal law will spend hours preparing himself or herself to attend.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Since the requisite skills and attributes can vary from class of business within a court, why can the advertisement not vary in that way?  If the advertisement is to vary in that way, and someone must make the decision as to whether it will, for example, whether the next appointee will be a criminal lawyer or an intellectual property lawyer, I believe it is the function of the Executive to make that decision, for example, that it wants an intellectual property lawyer.  It is perfectly reasonable to say to the commission that it should not waste its time or the time of innocent lawyers and legal academics asking them to apply for this job without telling them that the Government wants an intellectual property lawyer and does not want another family lawyer or another criminal lawyer.  It simply does not make sense.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise the sense of this amendment.  It certainly does not trench on the commission's independence to say that when it is making an appointment it should have regard to the Government's underlining purpose, which is to appoint an intellectual property lawyer rather than a criminal lawyer.  <\/p><p>This goes back to the fundamental lack of honesty in the philosophy behind this Bill and, in saying that, I am not making a personal comment.  It is for the Executive to choose whether we get an intellectual property lawyer.  It is not for an independent body to determine we want an intellectual property lawyer.  It is for the Executive to choose, for example, that we want two more criminal judges rather than for an independent body with a majority of lay people on it to determine that issue.  The Executive makes its decision on these matters under the Constitution.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that would trench on the independence of what is an advisory commission.  Although the word \"advise\" has been carefully taken out to keep the Minister, Deputy Ross, happy, it still remains an advisory body.  If the Government is asking for advice as to who it should appoint to a vacancy, it should at least be in a position to tell the body, from which it is seeking advice, that it intends to make a particular type of appointment.  What could be more simple, honest or transparent than that?  What could be more ridiculous than to say that should not happen, that the Government should not tell the body in question what kind of activity it has in mind for this person because to do so would be to trench on its independence?  That is asking the body to draw up a shortlist without regard to what the Government is minded to do.  That is absurd.  It defies belief that this is regarded as a measure that would trench on the body's independence.  It is utterly unfair, for instance, to the category of would-be family law judges that they are not told the day they apply that the vacancies, for which they are applying, are family law vacancies.  It is utterly unfair to say to criminal lawyers they might as well apply but we will not tell them until afterwards that they did not succeed because the Government did not want to appoint criminal lawyers.  <\/p><p>Since the principle is already conceded in section 50(2), it can be reasonably anticipated that a particular appointee to a vacancy in a court will be carrying out a particular class of business.  Therefore, why should the commission not take guidance from the Government as to what the Government is looking for?  I do not believe that even the Minister, Deputy Ross, in his wildest imagination could consider such an amendment as that prepared by myself and my colleagues to be cronyism or to tie the hands of the commission in the advice it gives.  It is merely saying we are interested in a particular type of judge, please tell the applicants that is what we are doing and when conducting the interviews, to have regard to the fact that this is what we intend to do.  There is nothing more sensible than that.  Under section 50(2) they are already entitled to put in place different statements of procedures for different classes of business.  Why can it not be that they are directed in a particular direction?  <\/p><p>Section 50(2) states that the power to provide \"a statement of requisite skills and attributes under this Part includes a power to prepare different statements of requisite skills and attributes by reference to ... in the case of judicial offices in the same court, different classes of business in that court that it is reasonably anticipated a particular appointee to such office would deal with\".  The principle is already conceded that there will be a different statement of attributes for an intellectual property judicial appointment but what we are saying is that if that is conceded, take the next logical step and put into the Bill some method whereby the Government can tell the commission that it wants to be advised, by means of a shortlist, of four people in that category and that it does not want to waste everybody else&rsquo;s time applying futilely for something for which they are obviously unsuited.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to reconsider what I have said is a knee-jerk reaction to this proposal.  It is designed to be constructive, to make the system work and not waste practitioners&rsquo; time applying for positions they will never get by warning them in advance of the category of appointment that is likely to be made on foot of the shortlist.  I can see nothing unfair about that or nothing that is trenching on the commission's independence.  It makes plain, simple common sense to me and it should not be rejected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#HH01200","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>From the point of view of grammar, section 50(2)(b) should read &ldquo;in the case of judicial offices in the same court, different classes of business in that court with which it is reasonably anticipated a particular appointee to such office would deal\" &ndash; ending with the verb.

First, it is for the Government and the Oireachtas to decide how many judges there are in the High Court.  We are told the Minister will bring in a Bill to increase the size of the Court of Appeal by a further six judges  in the near future.  In that court, that is a matter for the Government.  However, I can well imagine that at some stage in the next few years, a decision will be made by the Cabinet and the Oireachtas to increase the size of, for example, the Circuit Court, to deal with family law cases.  If they then, on foot of creating the six additional vacancies, for example, in family law under legislation for the Circuit Court, advertise those vacancies, surely those who apply for them are entitled to be informed by the commission by public advertisement that the Government is looking for family law lawyers.  There must be some mechanism whereby the Government's policy on this matter, given that it has a licence from the Oireachtas to appoint additional judges, is conveyed not merely to the commission via the Attorney General at a private meeting but also to would-be applicants so that they know what is going on.  Senator Norris mockingly accuses me of using the term \"lawyers\".  It is only fair to tell criminal law practitioners that it is anticipated that the three vacancies that are under advertisement are likely to be assigned to family law.  If that were not the case, why would the phrase appear in section 50 that \"in the case of judicial offices in the same court, different classes of business in that court that it is reasonably anticipated a particular appointee [that is a named person] ...\" will be assigned?  One of these three persons on the shortlist will be assigned to that business.  Why not tell those who are applying for that vacancy that this is one which one believes will be for intellectual property, criminal law, family law or whatever?  If one accepts that principle, I cannot see what is wrong with telling the applicants that such is the case.  The Minister has not provided for it in the Bill.<\/p> <p>He has not provided that advertisements of vacancies can specify different areas of business in a court.  He has also not provided for who would make that decision.  He has further not provided for whether it is the Government's decision or that of the president of the relevant court's in the last analysis.  If it was always simply the president of the court who assigned people, he or she would be in a weak position seeking additional appointments from the Government for the purpose of family law if in the end the commission decides that it is not particularly interested in extra family law judges and it believes the following three legal academics with expertise in civil law are the best qualified for the upcoming vacancies.  It is the Government's decision to make a choice in this area as regards whether a particular judicial vacancy should be filled towards a particular end, and that is what the Attorney General is there to advise the Government on.<\/p> <p>That is the other point.  It is the function of the Attorney General to say that we need another intellectual property lawyer and for the Government then to say that is a good idea and then tell the commission to go and look for an intellectual property lawyer and not put a silly advertisement in the newspapers looking merely for another judge in the High Court and have many lawyers apply for it without telling them that in private it has been decided that the name of the game is to appoint an intellectual property lawyer.<\/p> <p>I cannot see anything wrong with this principle.  I can see every reason it should be incorporated in the Bill.  It has nothing to do with the independence of the commission because if the commission published an advertisement that the Government had directed it to seek a person who would in all likelihood specialise in intellectual property law and receives a number of applications in that context, it independently makes up its mind as to who is to be on the shortlist and in what order they are to be recommended to the Government.  There is no trenching on their independence by asking them to be transparent in what they are doing and in what the Government is likely to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#KK00600","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I completely accept Senator McDowell's argument about the advertisement but I see nothing in his amendment about advertisement.

If, as I believe, it is the constitutional function of the Executive to make judicial appointments and if it is the case, as I believe, that a commission of this kind can only be purely advisory in nature, it seems strange that if the advisory body is going to advise the Government by way of shortlists on appointment by reference to statements of selection procedures and requisite skills and attributes, the body receiving the advice should have no input whatsoever in formulating the criteria by which the independent commission will draw up a shortlist and make recommendations.  Surely the Executive, if it is going to receive advice, is entitled, under a statutory scheme, to signal to the advisory body at the very least its satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the fundamental criteria by which that body is operating.<\/p><p>This is designed, of course, to ensure harmony between the commission and the Government so the Government does not find itself looking at people selected by reference to published statements that it is not keen on, or does not find itself not really liking the content of the statements published but yet receiving the shortlist.  It may find itself in the position of saying that if the body continues to submit recommended shortlists on the basis of the published criteria, it will simply exercise its constitutional function and simply appoint people off its own bat based on different criteria.  Surely there should be some consultative process whereby, if criteria are being drawn up and the system is to work harmoniously, there is a process of approval for the draft statements to be formulated and published under this Part.<\/p><p>I presume the Minister will say this is an interference with the independence of the commission but the commission is not independent.  The Constitution vests the function of choosing judges in the Executive, and it is the Executive that advises the President.  The commission is not wholly independent in determining the criteria that will govern the drawing up of the shortlist, nor should it be, but it does not trench upon its independence to ask it to send to the Government in draft form the criteria it proposes should apply and for the Government to say that it does not agree with points A, B  and C in the criteria, that it wants the commission to vary them, and that it wants to be advised by reference to the commission's draft criteria, as amended by it, the Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We want to be advised by reference to the Minister's draft criteria, as amended by us.  That process would be entirely transparent.  If the Government of the day was abusing it in any way, it would be accountable to Parliament and accountable to the court of public opinion.  If the criteria the Government wished to have varied in some way or another were in any way repugnant, that would be a matter of public knowledge.  I do not believe a Government would act unreasonably.  If an independent commission proposes A, B and C, a Government is unlikely to arbitrarily, maliciously or vindictively say it does not agree with the commission's particular statement of attributes, skills and so on.<br\/><br\/>I would prefer if the Bill acknowledged honestly that, in the last analysis, a role profile, such as section 50(1)(<i>b<\/i>) refers to, should be a matter publicly debated and the Government of the day should have something to say about it, not to be simply presented with a <i>fait accompli<\/i>from which shortlists are thereafter drawn up, when the Government is unhappy with the original criteria in the first place.

To bring this back to an area I am comfortable with and familiar with, that is, the selection of teachers, \"teacher\" is a title but there are many different types of teachers.  We engage with the staff in the location to find out what vacancies need to be filled in the same way that I would expect the commission to engage with the Executive as to what precisely it was looking for in drafting its terms of reference or its terms for the selection process.  I would expect that process to start before the position is advertised and that there would be ongoing engagement with the Minister.<\/p> <p>I agree with my colleague that the commission cannot be independent of Government.  It is there to advise Government and that is all it is doing - advising the Government.  However, it must also take the concerns of Government on board.  If we are going to pursue this legislation, the amendment that has been put forward by Senators McDowell and Boyhan and myself makes perfect sense.  It clears the air and takes some of the questionable areas out of it.<\/p> <p>I have significant difficulty with this Bill in any case.  At the end of the day, we can go through all of this process but a very assertive Taoiseach or Minister for Justice and Equality can turn around and say, \"That is all grand and dandy but I do not accept any of the three, and we are going to go off and appoint somebody else.\"  Who can stop them?  Who can say \"No\"?  We do not know anything about the three people or how they were selected, based on the way the Bill is put together.  There has to be engagement all the way through - engagement before the advertisement and engagement after the advertisement, followed by a report that goes to the Executive before the Executive then makes its choice, or not, as the case may be.  This amendment gives clarity to that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#NN00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Before the Minister comes in, there was another point I wished to make.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the provisions of section 51, which states: &quot;Without prejudice to section 53(2), the Procedures Committee may, as it considers appropriate for the purpose of assisting the Committee in the performance of its functions under this Part, consult with the President of each court (save a President who is a member of that Committee).&quot;  As I understand it, that last part in brackets would have to come out in any event.  Section 51 continues: &quot;The Procedures Committee may request submissions or observations, within such period as is specified in the request, from any person that it considers appropriate for the purpose of assisting the Committee in the performance of its functions under this Part.&quot;  Those functions include drawing up these statements.<\/p><p>What about the Government?  The commission is given the right to consult anybody it likes, as it sees fit.  The one body that does not feature in this consultative process is the Government itself.  I cannot see, since the Attorney General is on this commission, why he or she cannot bring the drafts to Government and ask what it makes of this and express a view one way or another about some of the proposed criteria.  I cannot see any reason that should not be done.  It is strange there is a discretion to consult with the presidents of each court, and a discretion to seek comments from other persons, but there is no obligation to go to the one organ of State entitled to make the ultimate decision to see what it makes of the proposed statements.<\/p><p>However, section 51(1) ends with a bracketed phrase, &quot;(save a President who is a member of that Committee).&quot;  As I understand it, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann amended the Bill to include every president of every court as an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the committee, so this section 51 is a bit of a remnant of an older version of this Bill.  That apart, I make the point that the entitlement under section 51(2) of the Minister's text to consult with other persons lies very strangely with there being no obligation to consult with the Government in regard to the criteria.<\/p><p>The interesting thing is that section 51(3) states: &quot;The Procedures Committee shall, in the performance of the function to which the consultation referred to in subsection (1), or the submissions or observations referred to in subsection (2) relate, consider the outcome of such consultations and such submissions or observations as are received within the period specified in the request referred to in subsection (2).&quot;  Perhaps the Minister will confirm that it is now his intention to delete section 51(2) since all the presidents are now <i>ex officio<\/i>members of this commission.  If there is a duty to consider the submissions it has received, surely there should be an obligation to consult the Government and to get its observations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019052800002#NN00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1559050200,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Following on from what Senator McDowell said, can anyone imagine a private organisation appointing a chief financial officer and consulting all the chief financial officers in town, but not the board of directors of the company or anybody on the management side?

The Government is entitled to be consulted at a preliminary stage for the reasons I explained earlier.  I am not happy that what the Minister pointed out about the obligation to consult him under section 54(3) is sufficient.  The Government, under the Constitution, has the sole prerogative of advising the President as to who should or should not be made a judge.  In those circumstances, it is strange indeed that while section 51 envisages other people being consulted at a preliminary stage in the drawing up of selection procedure statements and statements of requisite skills and attributes, the one body that the Minister has rejected as being entitled to be consulted is the Government itself.<\/p><p>The Attorney General is not a member of the procedures committee, <i>ex officio<\/i>, even though he or she is now, <i>ex officio<\/i>, a member of the commission itself.  Therefore, the Government is kept in the dark under these procedures until such time as the consultation takes place under section 54(3).  Even then, the language of that subsection is merely to impose upon the commission an obligation to &quot;consult with the Minister&quot;.  There is no obligation whatsoever to take on board any view of the Minister or the Government.  By that stage, of course, the procedures statement will have been circulated for comment to outside bodies and the Government, apparently, will be the last to hear about it.  That is not correct.  The Government should be one of the first to hear of the proposed content of these statements rather than just being presented with them on a take it or leave it basis.  Indeed, it is not even on a take it or leave it basis.  It is on a take it basis at the end because the commission can just ignore the Minister or just consult him or her at the very end of the process when, effectively, a lot of things will have happened which will have committed the commission to a particular approach to the statements in question.  I would much prefer if the proposed obligation to consult the Minister under section 54(3) was reconsidered and brought back to a much earlier stage, namely, the section 51 stage.  At that point, the Government as a whole could consider the issues being considered by the procedures committee rather than waiting for that committee to come up with a draft which would be presented to the Government, under section 54, by a simple consultative process.<\/p><p>There is an argument to be made for the Attorney General to be, <i>ex officio, <\/i>a member of the procedures committee.  However, because of the way this Bill developed, the Attorney General's presence on the commission at all was only an afterthought in the deliberations of the other House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It occurs to me that the involvement of the Attorney General should not simply be a minimal paper involvement.

During Report Stage in the D&aacute;il I committed to bringing in amendments to increase the number of health professionals on the board from one to two.
