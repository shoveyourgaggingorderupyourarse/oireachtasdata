I have engaged very actively with the US Middle East team over the past three years. I have made clear that Ireland would be willing to support any peace initiative that respected the international parameters for a two-state solution and UN Security Council resolutions, and provided a basis to meet the aspirations of both peoples. We need to see the details and assess the full implications of the US initiative, but from what I have heard so far, the proposed plan does not meet this threshold. A successful resolution of the conflict can only be reached if both parties are included on an equal basis and can work together for an agreed outcome. No solution can be imposed and no unilateral moves should take place.I am deeply concerned by the comments made by PM Netanyahu today regarding extending Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and over settlements across the West Bank. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Let me be clear - annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including by the UN Charter. Such an action would be a decisive step away from the Oslo Accords, which both parties signed, and which Ireland has worked tirelessly to support for over 25 years. It would also be a decisive step away from the commitment to an agreed solution between the parties; a solution which could be backed and supported by the international community as a whole.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  We will study the plan in more detail but our initial response is one of grave concern that it fails to achieve the balance and equality of esteem necessary to gain the support of both sides to the conflict and the international community. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I intend to remain in close contact with the parties, the countries of the region, with our EU partners and with the US.\"\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the weeks since the announcement of the US plan, my EU colleagues and I have continued to stress that any solution will require the agreement of both parties, and that no unilateral actions should take place. I welcomed the statement by the EU High Representative on 4 February, which recalled the EU&rsquo;s commitment a negotiated two-State solution, based on 1967 lines; called\u00a0on both sides to re-engage and to refrain from any unilateral actions contrary to international law that could exacerbate tensions; and made clear that steps towards annexation, if implemented, could not pass unchallenged.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains an integral aspect of our foreign policy, which I will continue to prioritise.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500051#WRB05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dublin-Monaghan Bombings","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500051#WRB05300"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[2872\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500051#WRB05400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the ongoing outstanding requests with the UK Government regarding inquiries into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>17 May last marked the 45th anniversary of the appalling attacks of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in which 33 people were murdered.

I also met with EU Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels in advance of the General Affairs Council.<\/p><p>The EU mandate sets out the EU&rsquo;s clear position, based on the Political Declaration agreed between the EU and the UK on 17 October 2019, as well as the European Council guidelines and conclusions. This provides a generous and fair foundation on which a new EU-UK relationship can be built. <\/p><p>There has been extensive interdepartmental co-ordination across Government to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s priorities are reflected in the EU mandate.  We have also worked closely with our EU partners to ensure that our collective approach to these negotiations reflects our priorities and interests. The mandate reflects the breadth and ambition on the part of the EU for a close and deep partnership with the UK. Of course, the level of ambition for the future partnership on the UK side will also influence what is possible to achieve. <\/p><p>We welcome the continuing focus in the EU mandate on protecting the Good Friday Agreement and on ensuring that issues arising from Ireland's unique geographic situation are addressed, as well as the Common Travel Area.  Protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the Peace Process in all circumstances continue to be key priorities for Ireland and these priorities are shared by our EU partners.<\/p><p>The UK Government published its approach to the negotiations on 27 February, in advance of the start of negotiations between the EU and the UK on Monday, 2 March. Negotiation rounds will alternate between London and Brussels, and, on the EU side, will be conducted on behalf of the 27 Member States, by the Task Force for Relations with the United Kingdom, under Michel Barnier, and the Commission.<\/p><p>It is welcome that the negotiations have opened in respect of a broad range of issues, as reflected in the mandate, with negotiations planned and underway on: <\/p><p>(i)Trade in Goods<\/p><p>(ii)Trade in Services and Investment and other issues<\/p><p>(iii)Transport (Aviation &amp;amp; Other)<\/p><p>(iv)Horizontal Arrangements and Governance<\/p><p>(v)Energy (Civil Nuclear Co-operation &amp;amp; Other)<\/p><p>(vi)Participation in Union Programmes<\/p><p>(vii)Level Playing Field for open and fair Competition<\/p><p>(viii)  Law Enforcement and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters<\/p><p>(ix)Mobility and Social Security Co-ordination<\/p><p>(x)Thematic Co-operation<\/p><p>(xi)Fisheries<\/p><p>Given the UK position that the transition period will not be extended beyond the end of 2020, as Michel Barnier has indicated, it may not be possible to reach agreement on all issues currently being discussed as part of the negotiations in the available time.  We will continue to work closely and assess progress with our EU partners as the talks progress. <\/p><p>The Political Declaration sets out a commitment to establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter alia, upholding access to waters and quota shares, within the context of the overall economic partnership. This issue was one which I discussed with Michel Barnier in Brussels last week and I welcome that he has been clear, that fisheries is part of the negotiations package, linked to FTA in goods and level playing field issues.<\/p><p>The work of the period ahead will be to achieve an ambitious and fair partnership that works for the benefit of all, and provides a new and strong foundation for the EU-UK relationship. <\/p><p>At the same time, it is important to see the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement.  The link between implementation and Future Relationship negotiations is also reflected in the mandate.<\/p><p>The ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement means that, regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations, the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland will be in place.<\/p><p>The Protocol includes measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, maintain the Common Travel Area, the Single Electricity Market and protect continuing North South cooperation. It maintains commitments to ensure no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It confirms that people in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens and reaffirms the EU and UK commitment to the PEACE PLUS programme.  <\/p><p>Implementing what has already been agreed between the EU and UK is important in establishing the trust needed for a successful outcome to the Future Relationship negotiations.<\/p><p>During the transition period, running to 31 December 2020, the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland \/ Northern Ireland will be overseen by the UK and the EU through the Joint Committee and Specialised Committees established under the Withdrawal Agreement. <\/p><p>The first meeting of the Joint Committee is expected to take place in March, with further meetings in 2020. European Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic will represent the EU at the Joint Committee and Michael Gove MP, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office, will represent the UK. <\/p><p>While the Joint Committee and the Specialised Committees are EU-UK fora, Ireland is preparing to engage appropriately in taking this work forward.  In accordance with Council Decision 2020\/135 of 30 January 2020, a representative of Ireland may accompany the Commission representative in meetings of the Committee on issues related to the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland where those issues are specific to Ireland\/Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500052#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500052#WRC01800"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[3695\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500052#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of contingency planning for all Brexit scenarios including a no-deal Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on 31 January 2020 and discussions on a future EU-UK relationship got underway on 2 March.\u00a0 It is important to recall that a range of key issues are resolved by the Withdrawal Agreement (i.e. citizen&rsquo;s rights, financial settlement and the Northern Ireland Protocol), as well as by the Common Travel Area.\u00a0 The transition period is scheduled to end on 31 December 2020, and while there is provision to extend it by agreement, the British Government has indicated that it does not intend to seek such an extension.

This is because the impact will depend on several factors, not least the duration of the epidemic as well as the containment measures put in place to limit its spread. These are simply impossible to estimate and, accordingly, it is extremely difficult to quantify the macroeconomic impact at this point in time. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the OECD has estimated that, in a scenario where economic disruption is mainly confined to China, with only limited spill-overs to other regions, measures put in place to contain the Covid19 virus could take &frac12; a percentage point (pp) off the growth rate of the global economy this year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I would stress, however, that this is a very benign scenario - it\u00a0is also based on the assumption that the impact is mostly contained to the first quarter of this year, which appears a somewhat heroic assumption.\u00a0 In a broader contagion scenario, where the economic fall-out is longer-lasting and more widespread, the OECD estimates that this could take 1&frac12; percentage points off the global growth rate. <\/p>  <p>  As small and export-oriented, the Irish economy is particularly sensitive to external economic conditions. Over the medium-term, the pass-through of a global shock to the domestic economy tends to be broadly one-for-one - i.e. if world demand falls by 1 pp then, over the medium term, Irish economic activity is c. 1 pp below what would otherwise have been the case &ndash; with a less than one-for-one impact in the short-term. Slower growth would, in turn, have negative consequences for the labour market and the public finances.<\/p>  <p>  While difficult to quantify at this stage, there are likely to be negative impacts for the Irish economy across a range of sectors.\u00a0 An increasingly integrated world economy means that supply-chains are also increasingly integrated, with many being &lsquo;just-in-time&rsquo;.\u00a0 Falling production of intermediate goods in China is now affecting the final output in other countries that will also likely impact production facilities in Ireland.\u00a0 In terms of direct trade links, the share of goods trade with China is around 6 per cent of total trade, based on preliminary data for last year. <\/p>  <p>  However, indirect exposure to China is potentially more significant. The euro area is Ireland&rsquo;s largest trading partner, accounting for close to a third of total exports.\u00a0 In turn, China accounts for 9 per cent of total euro area goods and services trade. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department is monitoring the situation closely and will prepare updated economic forecasts over the next month or so, taking into account all of the latest available information. \u00a0It must be stressed, however, that in the current environment, there is much more uncertainty than normal attached to any set of forecasts.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[2564\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that certain taxi drivers are receiving insurance quotations for their vehicle that are more than double the quotations being received from other insurance providers; the reason such a large discrepancy can exist; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>At the outset the Deputy should note that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. <\/p>  <p>  Having said that, in terms of the insurance market and pricing, my Department has been previously advised that insurers, in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, will use a combination of rating factors, which include the age of the vehicle, as well as the type of vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant driving experience, the claims record, the number of drivers, the requirement to use telematics technology, and how the car is used.\u00a0 Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.\u00a0 In addition, insurers will price in accordance with their own past claims experience overall. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of taxi drivers, I understand that insurers take into account the nature of the taxi business, which involves driving for hire or reward extensively and in their view this has a much higher risk of injury claims from passengers and other road-users as a result.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the number of taxi and hackney drivers utilising the Insurance Ireland Declined Cases Agreement fell from 375 in 2016 to 205 in 2019, which suggests increased stability in the market and greater availability of insurance for drivers.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, this particular price differential highlighted by the Deputy reinforces the importance of businesses and consumers shopping around for the best value insurance product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Union Services","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[2566\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the operation of the death grant scheme by credit unions; if same is supported by his Department and the Central Bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>Firstly, I am assuming that the Deputy's question is referring to the Death Benefit Insurance schemes operated by credit unions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Many credit unions participate in Death Benefit Insurance schemes whereby a payment, intended to assist with funeral expenses, is made following the death of a member.

The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.\u00a0 In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.\u00a0 Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. Last year, the report of the interdepartmental review of LPT noted\u00a0that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options, deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.\u00a0\u00a0Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises. \u00a0The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.<\/p>  <p>  The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.\u00a0 A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance. <\/p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.\u00a0 Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Card Data","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[2570\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of personal and business credit cards in operation here; the proportion of credit cards in cases in which the consumer regularly ends up paying interest; the level of arrears or overdue repayments in respect of the cards; the amount of stamp duty collected annually on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>The Central Bank publishes data on its website for the number of credit cards in Ireland, and it reports that there were 1,579,561 active credit cards in issue as of January 2020.

It is also important to note that the Probate Office of the High Court deals with matters relating to probate and as such is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may also wish to note that under section 21 of the 1997 Act, a credit union member may nominate a third party (e.g. a family member) to be the recipient upon the death of the member to the whole or part of the member&rsquo;s property that they have in the credit union at the time of their death.<\/p>  <p>  The 1997 Act\u00a0imposes a statutory limit of &euro;23,000 on the amount that can be passed by way of a nomination. Thus, if at the date of the nominator's death the amount of the member&rsquo;s property in the credit union exceeds &euro;23,000, the credit union may only dispose any property up to the value of &euro;23,000. The effect of these provisions are that any nomination up to &euro;23,000 will pass outside the terms of any will. Any sum in excess of this will revert to and be an asset of the estate, which needs to be distributed under the terms of the will or the rules of succession where there is no will.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank have also advised me\u00a0that in order to be registered a credit union must have a set of rules. Under section 15 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 the registered rules of a credit union bind all members. In some\u00a0cases these rules specifically\u00a0set out the credit union's approach to the nomination of property and the statutory limit under the 1997 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may\u00a0also\u00a0wish to note that Section 23 of the Credit Union Act 1997 as amended\u00a0(1997\u00a0Act)\u00a0provides for the provision of small payments on death. Under section 23 if a member of a credit union dies and, at his death, his property in the credit union does not in the whole exceed &euro;15,000 and is not the subject of a nomination under section 21 the board of directors of the credit union may, without letters of administration or probate of any will, distribute that property among such persons as appears to the board (on such evidence as they consider satisfactory) to be entitled by law to receive it.<\/p>  <p>  Ordinarily the production of a grant of probate would be required to release funds from a bank account to the personal representative, irrespective of the amount. However, if a person dies leaving small amounts of money in a bank, the bank may agree to release the funds without the necessity for a grant of probate.<\/p>  <p>  While most applicants instruct a solicitor to process their application for a grant of probate, personal applications can also be made to the Probate Office of the High Court for a grant of probate.<\/p>  <p>  If an individual is not satisfied in any of their dealings with a financial services provider the individual may make a complaint to the provider&rsquo;s internal complaint resolution process. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the complaint, they can then make a complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. Investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the complainant.

However when examined from an average claim perspective, they indicate that the average settlement for litigated cases under &euro;100,000 is just over &euro;23,000 while the accompanying average legal costs is just over &euro;14,500.\u00a0\u00a0When this is compared with the average PIAB award of just over &euro;22,500, and its average legal costs of &euro;753, it raises questions about how the differential in legal costs can be justified.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the length of time to settle these claims is nearly two years longer than in PIAB, which in itself drives up the cost of insurance.\u00a0\u00a0I do not believe these differentials are sustainable and\u00a0in light of this comparative information, set out in the NCID report and the table, I believe that legal profession needs to recognise their role regarding costs.\u00a0\u00a0The data within the NCID report makes it clear that in overall terms, PIAB offers the most cost effective settlement channel and I would hope that its settlement rates increase going forward.\u00a0\u00a0This is a key aim of our work in the CIWG.<\/p><p>In conclusion, the NCID Report demonstrates why we must address award levels in this country if we want to see cheaper insurance premiums and an increased risk appetite from insurers.\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, the data in the NCID Report shows that personal injury claims have been driving the cost of claims in recent years &ndash; representing 75% of the ultimate claims costs over the period.\u00a0\u00a0This is not sustainable in my view.\u00a0\u00a0This is all the more concerning as the Report shows that these increased costs are not being driven by a higher frequency of claims.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that our focus therefore must continue to be on the Judicial Council and its publication of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Branch Closures","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD03900"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[2687\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the ongoing closures of commercial bank branches nationwide; his further views on whether many persons, including the elderly, will be left without convenient commercial bank services; the steps he will take with the Central Bank to prevent further closures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the banking sector is experiencing a challenging operating environment and\u00a0the traditional banking model has been under pressure for some years to adapt and deal with legacy issues.

Notwithstanding this, I do expect that any bank closing branches will do everything it can to mitigate the impacts of the branch closures on local communities, including technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank, that within its Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) that there is a requirement that a regulated firm must not, through its policies, procedures, or working practice, prevent access to basic financial services. In addition, Provision 3.12 of the Code requires that banks make clear to consumers when they intend to close a branch, in order to allow consumers to make alternative arrangements if they so wish.\u00a0 When intending to close, merge or move a branch, the bank must:<\/p>  <p>  1. notify the Central Bank immediately;<\/p>  <p>  2. provide at least two months&rsquo; notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements;<\/p>  <p>  3. ensure all business of the branch is properly completed prior to its closure, merger or move, or alternatively inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided; and<\/p>  <p>  4. notify the wider community of the closure, merger or move in the local press in advance.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the requirements of Provision 3.12, when the Central Bank is made aware of any branch closures, it engages with the regulated entity to ensure the impact of any decision regarding branch closures is carefully considered across its full customer base. The Central Bank expects that the regulated entity in question will provide affected vulnerable customers with all the assistance that is necessary to ensure that they retain full access to basic financial services, albeit at another branch location.<\/p>  <p>  For those who are concerned that there is a lack of convenient commercial bank services in light of branch closures, I would like to draw your attention to the Indecon report on Community Banking in Ireland published by my Department in December 2019. The report concluded that there is extensive provision of banking services by credit unions, An Post, as well as by commercial banking providers in the Irish market. <\/p>  <p>  The report found that there are 1,912 branches operated by banks, credit unions and post offices in Ireland, 63% of these branches are post offices or credit unions and 37% are banks.

Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises or increase capacity.\u00a0 This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that it can neither direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied, nor can it direct insurance companies as to the pricing level, which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance.<\/p>  <p>  However, insurance reform remains a priority. Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.\u00a0 This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.\u00a0 There has been significant progress in the implementation of the two CIWG Reports. Examples include the following:\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  -  the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;<\/p>  <p>  -  the establishment of the Judicial Council and its Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which is due to prepare new draft guidelines for personal injuries awards later this year;<\/p>  <p>  -  the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; the Central Bank is to commence work on \u00a0expanding its scope to cover employer and public liability insurance this year;<\/p>  <p>  -  reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019; <\/p>  <p>  -  amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p>  <p>  -  the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers;<\/p>  <p>  -  various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent commitment by the Garda Commissioner to investigate insurance fraud at a divisional level and which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) who will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality; and,<\/p>  <p>  -  the work currently underway by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries.<\/p>  <p>  These reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from January 2020 show that the price of motor insurance is now 27.4% lower than the July 2016 peak).\u00a0 It is important to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.\u00a0 In this regard, I believe good progress has been made with the establishment of a Judicial Council and its decision to nominate 28 April for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee (PIGC). My understanding is that this means that the PIGC will be required by the legislation to submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council by 28 October.\u00a0 While the Government cannot interfere in the Judicial Council&rsquo;s deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, I would hope that the Guidelines will take into account the Personal Injury Commission&rsquo;s benchmarking report, and can come into operation as soon as possible following their submission to the Judicial Council. \u00a0In return for lower and more consistent award levels, I believe insurers have to significantly reduce their premium levels and broaden their risk horizons.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputies\u00a0 that the Cost of Insurance Working Group is continuing to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.\u00a0 The cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations should include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500053#WRD06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500054#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[2927\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500054#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost to the Exchequer on an annual basis of illegal trade in tobacco, drink and fuel products; the additional measures planned to counteract such illicit trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[2928\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500054#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the additional measures he plans to implement to counteract illegal cross-Border trade in tobacco, drink and fuel products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that combating the threat which fuel fraud and the illicit alcohol and tobacco trades pose to legitimate business, consumers and the Exchequer continues to be a priority. <\/p>  <p>  Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal fuel trade include the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements, and a rigorous programme of risk focused enforcement action. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud. <\/p>  <p>  Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the diversion of untaxed alcohol onto the market, through the production of counterfeit alcohol and through smuggling from countries with lower taxes. Revenue takes appropriate action where illicit activity is detected and this action is informed by intelligence on criminal activity and risk-based examination of commercial traffic and stock in retail premises. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue acts against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade and uses a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages to intercept illicit products. Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against fuel, alcohol and tobacco crime, and also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality, who operate across jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is inherently difficult to estimate the extent of any illegal trade with confidence and it is not possible, therefore, to estimate the potential loss to the Exchequer of illegal trade in alcohol. The extent of the illicit trade in cigarettes is estimated, however, through annual surveys of smokers that are carried out for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Service Executive by IPSOS MRBI. The 2018 survey found that 13% of cigarettes consumed in the State were illicit. This compares to a survey estimate of 13% for 2017 and 10% for 2016. Assuming that the illicit cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantity of cigarettes, the results of the 2018 survey indicate that the loss to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT was approximately &euro;211m.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Revenue conducted random National Sampling Programmes in the years 2016 to 2019 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The programmes each involved nearly one in ten of some 2,500 holders of auto fuel trader licences. Tests of diesel samples taken from the randomly selected traders found no evidence of the new marker in any of them. The results of this sampling are a clear indication that Revenue&rsquo;s actions have resulted in the near elimination of the selling of laundered products at retail level. The 2018 sampling programme was expanded to include hauliers and other businesses in the transport sector. A very small number of samples from this programme tested positive. The results of the 2019 sampling programme were broadly in line with previous years. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit alcohol and tobacco trades has achieved a considerable level of success. I know that Revenue is very conscious of the resourcefulness of those involved in these forms of criminal activity and remains vigilant for, and ready to respond to, any new developments in these areas.

including insurance coverage for events that they hold.\u00a0 I have much sympathy for the position such groups find themselves in, however as the Deputy is aware, there are significant constraints on what the Government can do to immediately resolve this issue.\u00a0 In this regard, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to community groups or their events, as this is a commercial matter for insurers.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by EU Single Market rules relating to insurance which expressly prohibit Member States from adopting rules, which would require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.\u00a0 A further constraint is the fact that the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these constraints, insurance reform remains a priority.\u00a0 The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers, businesses and the voluntary\/community and arts sectors.\u00a0 The CIWG has produced two reports: the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Many reforms have been made already, including amendments to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, and the establishment of National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland.\u00a0 It is clear however that the single biggest challenge that still needs to be addressed and which is having the most impact on the community group sector is the level of awards that exist in Ireland, for relatively minor injuries, as compared to other jurisdictions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the key recommendation arising from both of the CIWG&rsquo;s reports was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports.\u00a0 The PIC conducted a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time and this has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced.\u00a0 This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales.\u00a0 On foot of the PIC recommendations, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the Judicial Council Act 2019.\u00a0 This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.\u00a0 This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum. <\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased that the Judicial Council held its first meeting on 7 February, and that it has nominated 28 April for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.\u00a0 I understand that this means that it will be required by the legislation to submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council by 28 October.\u00a0 While the Government cannot interfere in the Judicial Council&rsquo;s deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, I would hope that the Guidelines will take into account the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report, and can come into operation as soon as possible following their submission to the Judicial Council.\u00a0 In return for lower and more consistent award levels, I believe insurers have to significantly reduce their premium levels and broaden their risk horizons.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In summary, the key outstanding challenge to satisfactorily resolve the cost and availability of insurance issue is a recalibration of award levels downwards. \u00a0I believe that if this is done and these awards are applied consistently by the courts, the current problems being experienced by impacted community groups, as well as other businesses and organisations more generally, will recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500054#WRE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax

The expense should apply to all employees in that category and not be discretionary. Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue has recently completed a comprehensive review of their FRE regime. The purpose of the review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, was to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.\u00a0 Each category of FRE allowance was examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 of the TCA 1997, which provide that expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer. Notwithstanding this review, I understand Revenue is willing to engage with representative bodies of any large groups of employees, including dental hygienists, to consider an application for flat rate employment expenses.\u00a0 \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Revenue recently announced its decision to defer the implementation of any planned changes to the FRE regime until 1 January 2021, to allow time, as part of the annual Tax Strategy Group process,\u00a0for the examination of a number policy matters that were raised during Revenue&rsquo;s review.\u00a0 Consequently, there will be\u00a0no change to FRE allowances for 2020.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.\u00a0\u00a0There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500054#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Levy","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500054#WRE03000"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[3335\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500054#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the imposition of a levy on private pensions during the financial emergency; if he will take appropriate measures including intervention with the relevant private pension companies to ensure that the value of these pensions are restored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[3774\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500054#WRE03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the pension levy for the occupational pension will be reimbursed.","asker":"1596","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 105 together.<\/p>  <p>  The pension fund levy was introduced in 2011 in the wake of the financial crash and at a time when the economy was in serious difficulties.

This is because the impact will depend on several factors, not least the duration of the epidemic as well as the containment measures put in place to limit its spread. These are simply impossible to estimate and, accordingly, it is extremely difficult to quantify the macroeconomic impact at this point in time. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the OECD has estimated that, in a scenario where economic disruption is mainly confined to China, with only limited spill-overs to other regions, measures put in place to contain the Covid19 virus could take &frac12; a percentage point (pp) off the growth rate of the global economy this year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I would stress, however, that this is a very benign scenario - it\u00a0is also based on the assumption that the impact is mostly contained to the first quarter of this year, which appears a somewhat heroic assumption.\u00a0 In a broader contagion scenario, where the economic fall-out is longer-lasting and more widespread, the OECD estimates that this could take 1&frac12; percentage points off the global growth rate. <\/p>  <p>  As small and export-oriented, the Irish economy is particularly sensitive to external economic conditions. Over the medium-term, the pass-through of a global shock to the domestic economy tends to be broadly one-for-one - i.e. if world demand falls by 1 pp then, over the medium term, Irish economic activity is c. 1 pp below what would otherwise have been the case &ndash; with a less than one-for-one impact in the short-term.

Given that a visitor proposal for St. Laurence's Gate is not in sight in the short term, the question of an application for funding to Failte Ireland does not arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500055#WRF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500055#WRF04600"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[2807\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500055#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works is liaising with other statutory bodies including Kerry County Council in relation to this matter.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500055#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500055#WRF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[2862\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500055#WRF05000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the plans by the OPW to purchase property for Garda stations in counties Cavan, Monaghan or Meath; the stages in negotiation for each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works has no current requirement\u00a0to purchase property for Garda Stations in the\u00a0counties referred to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500055#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500056#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[2909\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500056#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the funding allocated to flood risk management through the OPW in each of the years 2018 to 2027 that is already committed and due to be committed under the National Development Plan 2018-2027.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>Capital expenditure and funding for flood risk management\u00a0for the period 2018 to 2027 is set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>       <th>2021<\/th>       <th>2022<\/th>       <th>2023<\/th>       <th>2024<\/th>       <th>2025<\/th>       <th>2026<\/th>       <th>2027<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Expenditure\/Allocation<\/td>       <td>&euro;64.64m*<\/td>       <td>&euro;58.29mm*<\/td>       <td>&euro;85.866m**<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Actual expenditure in these years<\/p><p>** Revised Estimates allocation\u00a0<\/p><p>The above allocations will allow the OPW in collaboration with Local Authorities to continue implementation of its comprehensive programme of investment in flood relief schemes nationally as announced in May 2018 at the launch of the Flood Risk Management Plans under the CFRAM Programme.\u00a0 This programme amounts to &euro;1 billion approximately and includes over 150 individual flood relief projects which the Government is committed to implementing within the timeframe of the National Development Plan.In addition to the major projects, the OPW will continue to fund Local Authorities to undertake local flood relief projects up to a limit of &euro;750,000 under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.

Priority has been given to additional funding in the areas of infrastructure, education, childcare and health. This investment delivers on immediate social and economic needs while also providing sustained longer-term benefits to the State. Strong growth in capital spending is a notable feature of the recovery in public spending. This investment has centred on key areas such as social housing, transport and schools and is reflective of the Government&rsquo;s goal of delivering growth-enhancing investment in conjunction with sustainable progress on social priorities.  <\/p>  <p>  Recent fiscal policy has been based on implementing sustainable growth in expenditure that remains affordable over the medium term. In supporting this position, the Government has strived to ensure that public services are delivered in the most efficient and effective way possible. To this end, a number of reforms have been put in place in recent years, including the Performance Budgeting Initiative, the Equality Budgeting Initiative, the National Economic Dialogue and the Spending Review.<\/p>  <p>  It is crucial that this approach is maintained in the medium term in order to mitigate against emerging risks in the domestic and global economy. In light of this, it is imperative that both current and capital expenditure is managed within profile this year by all Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The Update to the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy published by the Department of Finance on 9th January set out fiscal projections to 2025. The strategy underpinning these projections is focussed on delivering General Government surpluses that would act as the first line of defence against potential risks to the economy and public finances.<\/p>  <p>  Within this Fiscal framework it is imperative that sustainable expenditure policies, that continue to deliver improvements in public services and infrastructure, are pursued to support the well-being of the overall Irish economy and continued economic and social progress. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500056#WRG05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[3114\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500056#WRG05300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the main aspects of the benefited influence of expenditure and reform to the citizenry over the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[3118\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500056#WRG05400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which public expenditure and reform has been instrumental in the delivery of results to the country and the citizenry in the past eight years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[3122\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500056#WRG05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which the performance of his Department has contributed to economic recovery here; the way in which this compares to other jurisdictions throughout the EU in the eurozone and elsewhere; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":407,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137, 141 and 145 together.<\/p><p>Following a period of consolidation, it has been possible since 2015 to provide for moderate, sustainable expenditure growth on an annual basis. The Government has prioritised spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity whilst making incremental and sustainable improvements in public services. The steady growth in expenditure in recent years reflects the significant effort made by the Government to moderate the level of expenditure increases and to secure a sustainable long-term path to growth. <\/p><p>In further support of this, a wide range of budgetary reforms have been implemented in the last number of years to improve transparency and accountability around the Budget process, while also facilitating best economic practice. This includes initiatives such as performance and equality budgeting and new publications such as the Summer Economic Statement and the Mid-Year Expenditure Report. <\/p><p>Sound public finances are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth in the context of our economic recovery and to progress towards our social and economic goals. This requires effective and efficient management of overall expenditure. To support this goal, my Department has been engaging for the last three years with a range of Departments on the Spending Review process. The aim of this process is reinforce a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. Budget 2020 also saw the publication of the first &lsquo;Citizen&rsquo;s Guide to the Budget&rsquo;; a short, accessible document which put the Budget in simple terms, in order to make the process as accessible as possible. This document also sets out the services that will be delivered to the people of Ireland in an accessible way. For example, in 2020: <\/p><p>-  108,000 children will be enrolled in the ECCE programme;<\/p><p>-  137,000 farmers will be supported through various agricultural schemes;<\/p><p>-  355,000 people will be provided with illness, disability and carer's benefit; and<\/p><p>-  677,000 people will be provided with pension payments. <\/p><p>Over the last five years, Irish General Government expenditure as a proportion of GNI* has moved to be broadly in line with the EU average figures for General Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

In short, a suite of both education and health therapeutic supports was required to support children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes to primary and post primary schools from 2020\/21 onwards will be based on the school profile used for the allocation of Special Education Teachers. The additional 1,064 SNA posts provided in Budget 2020 will facilitate the transition to the new allocation model as well as meeting other priorities.<\/p><p>Under the new allocation model:<\/p><p>- No schools will receive an allocation of SNA support for mainstream classes which is less than their existing 2019\/20 mainstream SNA allocation on the introduction of the frontloaded model and some schools will gain<\/p><p>- Parents will not be required to secure a diagnosis of disability in order to access SNA support &ndash; the link between diagnosis and resources will be broken<\/p><p>- Where schools have an SNA, SNA support will be available immediately to students in mainstream classes upon their arrival in school thereby reducing delays in accessing support. <\/p><p>- Schools will have greater autonomy and flexibility in how their SNA allocation is deployed to meeting the needs of the students in their schools. <\/p><p>- Frontloading will reduce the administrative burden on schools who have to follow up on assessments under the current application-based process.<\/p><p>- SNAs will have more certainty around their tenure of employment and the new model does not change their roles and functions.<\/p><p>- Frontloading will free up valuable resources in the system which are currently involved in carrying out assessments (HSE and NEPS) and administering an assessment based allocation system so children can access SNA support.  These valuable resources can now be redirected to meeting other priority needs and to providing increased supports for families and schools.<\/p><p>These new arrangements will not impact on the way SNAs are currently allocated to special classes and special schools. Professional assessments will continue to be required in these cases and the normal application process will continue.<\/p><p>To support the implementation of the new model the Department held a broadly based consultation with key stakeholders on 4<sup>th<\/sup>and 5<sup>th<\/sup>February. <\/p><p>The purpose of the consultation was to, brief stakeholders on how the allocation model will operate, to explore the nature of any challenges and opportunities expected to arise during the implementation phase and any action that may be required in this regard, to consider the supports and information required to support effective implementation and to consider any other relevant issues. <\/p><p>A number of stakeholders who attended the consultation sessions made submissions to Department on the new model and further individual meetings are currently taking place with the stakeholders concerned.<\/p><p>Following the consideration of the outcome of the consultation a circular will be developed for issue to schools.  The circular will outline, inter alia, the content of the model, the scope for appeals and school reviews, training and supports to be provided.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.\u00a0For school planning purposes, Wexford town is located in the Wexford school planning area. <\/p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.\u00a0 This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.<\/p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p><p>- Utilising existing\u00a0unused\u00a0capacity within a school or schools,<\/p><p>- Extending the capacity of a\u00a0school or schools,<\/p><p>- Provision of a new school\u00a0or\u00a0schools.<\/p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.\u00a0 This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.\u00a0 Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. <\/p><p>In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four year period 2019 to 2022. This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.<\/p><p>While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Wexford\u00a0school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.<\/p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040.

The determination of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; includes an assessment of the intention of the person to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction.  Recognition of foreign divorces granted prior to the coming into operation of the 1986 Act on 2 October 1986 is governed by common law domicile rules which are now consistent with those in the 1986 Act.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment granted in another EU Member State on or after 1 March 2001 is governed by EU Council Regulation 2201\/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (also known as the Brussels II bis or the Brussels IIa Regulation).  This Regulation provides for EU judicial co-operation and recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border matrimonial matters.\u00a0 Under the Regulation, divorces, legal separations or marriage annulments granted in all EU States, with the exception of Denmark, are entitled to recognition if granted in accordance with jurisdictional criteria specified in the Regulation.

It is underpinned by key principles which include using detention as a last resort and diverting children away from involvement in criminal activity.<\/p><p>The first main filter in the youth justice system is the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, which focuses on preventing criminal behaviour as well as diversion from the criminal justice system and rehabilitation of children between 10 and 18 years of age. The Garda Youth Diversion Programme is supported by a network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs).\u00a0 These projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime or anti-social behaviour and to support wider preventative work within the community and with families at risk. <\/p><p>The second main filter provided in the Children Act is the range of non-custodial sanctions available to the courts. Part 9 of the Children Act 2001\u00a0provides for\u00a0a suite of community sanctions including Probation Order, Mentoring Order and Detention and Supervision Order. The Probation Order with specified conditions is used most frequently, as it provides flexibility in tailoring the intervention to meet the individual needs of the young person concerned.<\/p><p>Young Persons Probation (YPP) is a division of the Probation Service which was established in 2006. YPP supervise the community sanctions contained in the Children Act 2001. I am assured that the Probation Service at all times works to support each young person to comply with their court order. Non-compliance with a community sanction can however result in the young person being returned to court, at which time they may be afforded a further opportunity to comply, the order may be varied by the presiding judge, or a period of detention may be imposed. <\/p><p>I have consulted with the Probation Service with regard to the data requested by the Deputy.

Furthermore, the public notices and checklist for business continuity planning have been distributed to LEO clients.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the onset of COVID-19, it is possible that a number of businesses could experience working capital pressure due to supply chain and other impacts. There are several financing supports available that may be appropriate to provide liquidity support to impacted businesses:<\/p>  <p>  - The Credit Guarantee Scheme provides a State guarantee to accredited lenders (Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland) of 80% on eligible loans or Performance Bonds to viable micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\u00a0 Facilities from &euro;10,000 up to &euro;1,000,000 are offered.\u00a0 To access the Scheme, businesses can approach one of the participating providers.\u00a0 The Scheme is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI);<\/p>  <p>  - The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme is administered by Microfinance Ireland with the purpose of providing unsecured loans of &euro;2,000 up to &euro;25,000 for terms of up to five years to microenterprises employing fewer than 10 people, with viable business propositions that cannot obtain funding through traditional sources. The scheme can be accessed through the Local Enterprise Office Network, through the Irish Local Development Network, or by applying directly using the Microfinance Ireland portal;<\/p>  <p>  - While the SBCI Brexit Loan Scheme supports working capital needs for businesses impacted by Brexit-related issues, it is possible that some businesses may be impacted by both Brexit and COVID-19 related working capital issues. Therefore, it may be a suitable support for some affected businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department participate in various co-ordination groups relevant to managing Ireland&rsquo;s response to COVID-19, such as the Health Threats Co-Ordination Group, the Department of Health Communications Group and a Senior Officials Group convened by Department of An Taoiseach, and are kept up to date with all developments and can also raise issues that are relevant to our Department and Offices. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor evolving developments and will engage with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Health and other Government bodies in relation to further precautionary measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500072#WRX03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health and Safety Authority ","counter":1319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500072#WRX03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1320,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[3191\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500072#WRX03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the budget allocation for the Health and Safety Authority in each of the years 2018 to 2020, in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1321,"content":"<p>The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has a broad mandate which includes occupational health and safety, chemical safety, market surveillance and national accreditation.<\/p><p>In the area of occupational health and safety the Authority provides practical advice, guidance and support as well as carrying out inspections and investigations.

I secured for my Department an additional &euro;15m Current and &euro;63 million capital funding in Budget 2019 and a further &euro;9 million in current funding and &euro;12 million in capital funding in Budget 2020. These resources have allowed me to increase allocations across the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), Enterprise Ireland (EI), and InterTradeIreland (ITI) to establish and continue to fund Brexit-related schemes and provide services. Furthermore, &euro;6.4 million of the increase to my Department&rsquo;s current budget in 2020 will allow for additional resources to be provided to the Department&rsquo;s regulatory bodies and its enterprise agencies to continue to prepare for a post-Brexit environment, in whatever form it may take, by expanding and further developing the suite of available supports.<\/p><p>My Department's funding allocation to the LEOs has been increased from &euro;33 million in 2018 to &euro;38.2 million in 2020. This increase is being used to support micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The LEOs are active across all counties and are working with enterprises across a broad range of sectors to ensure that they are informed about Brexit and have plans in place to manage new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. To date, there have been 7,040 participants at LEO Brexit Information Events and 1,381 mentoring participants focused solely on Brexit. There have also been 1,720 participants in the customs training programme that the LEOs have rolled out for all businesses, exporters and importers, in conjunction with EI. <\/p><p>My Department's funding allocation to EI has been increased from &euro;273 million in 2018 to &euro;282 million in 2020. Whilst these increases are not focused solely on Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by the UK's withdrawal from the EU. For example, I was pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75 million to EI in 2019 to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, which includes Brexit.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Funding to EI\u00a0also supports the organisation in the provision of\u00a0Brexit-specific supports such as: the running of Brexit Advisory Clinics, at which there has been over 1,200 attendees to date; the EI Brexit Act On Programme, which is a support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise a report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience, and 359 Act On Plans have been completed to date; and the Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs Grant, to which there has been 250 applications made to date to access financial support through the scheme.<\/p><p>The funding allocation to InterTradeIreland by my Department increased by &euro;1 million in 2019 and by a further &euro;1m in 2020 to enable the organisation to engage with more of the companies seeking its support through the Brexit Advisory Service. 5,416 SMEs directly engaged with the ITI Brexit Advisory Service in 2019 and this is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018. <\/p><p>ITI also supports businesses through Brexit Planning Vouchers, worth up to &euro;2,250. These vouchers enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the\u00a0EU and on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.\u00a0 To date 1,837 of such vouchers have been approved. Furthermore, in March 2019, ITI launched a Brexit Implementation Voucher, which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with ITI paying 50% of total expenditure. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship. To date 44 such vouchers have been approved.<\/p><p>To enable retailers to increase their customer base and build a more resilient business, I also introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme in 2018 administered by EI. The Scheme, with a fund of up to &euro;1.25m over two Calls, provided funding to 40 retailers across Ireland, with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50 per cent match fund basis. This scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. The Pilot Online Retail Scheme concluded in 2019 and my Department and EI will review its effectiveness.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched at the end of March 2018, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, it leverages up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million &ndash; &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. To date 889 applications have been approved for eligibility\u00a0and 236 loans have been progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;49.57 million. To date there have been 173 repeat eligibility applications. <\/p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for applications through the SBCI in April of 2019. The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, and using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, it leverages up to &euro;300 million to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by my Department (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million. To date 2,980 applications have been approved for eligibility and 1,010 have been progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;207.95 million. <\/p><p>Furthermore, in the event that there is no trade agreement at the end of the transition period, the Brexit contingency provision in Budget 2020 will enable my Department, in conjunction with its enterprise agencies, to ensure that a range of targeted supports are available to vulnerable-but-viable businesses to survive the initial shock of a 'no deal' and also to enable them to successfully transition so that they can operate in the post Brexit environment. <\/p><p>If there is no\u00a0agreement, &euro;220 million will be made available immediately. Of this, &euro;110 million will be made available to my Department to help vulnerable-but-viable businesses. Supports will include: <\/p><p>- &euro;45m Transition Fund  <\/p><p>- &euro;42m Rescue and Restructuring Fund  <\/p><p>- &euro;8m Transformation Fund for Food and Non-Food businesses <\/p><p>- &euro;5m extra for Micro Finance Ireland <\/p><p>- &euro;5m for a Local Enterprise Offices Emergency Brexit Fund <\/p><p>- &euro;2m extra for InterTradeIreland <\/p><p>- &euro;3m extra for Regulatory Bodies <\/p><p>- &euro;40m will be available, if necessary, to support Tourism. <\/p><p>&euro;110m will be provided through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to support our beef sector and food companies: &euro;85 million will be provided for beef farm enterprises; &euro;14 million for fisheries enterprises; &euro;6 million for other livestock farms and mushroom enterprises; and &euro;5 million for the food and drinks processing industry. <\/p><p>The first table attached sets out the uptake of Brexit preparedness supports available through my Department and its agencies as at\u00a014\u00a0February 2020 (unless otherwise indicated).<\/p><p>The second table attached sets out the respective Voted budget allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2020, and the cost\/expenditure of the supports in so far as they are currently available.<\/p><p><b>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Allocation and Expenditure for Brexit Related Supports<\/b><\/p><p><b>Budget Allocations Across Enterprise Development Agencies<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>2018 (&euro;'000)<\/th>       <th>2019 (&euro;'000)<\/th>       <th>2020 (&euro;'000)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>IDA<\/td>       <td>180,780<\/td>       <td>193,670<\/td>       <td>189,177<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland*<\/td>       <td>272,998<\/td>       <td>279,818<\/td>       <td>282,082<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>InterTradeIreland<\/td>       <td>8,125<\/td>       <td>9,145<\/td>       <td>10,192<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Offices<\/td>       <td>32,931<\/td>       <td>37,931<\/td>       <td>38,181<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><i>The budget for the Disruptive Technology Fund is not included in these figure<\/i><\/p><p><b>Expenditure\/Cost per Scheme<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>   Scheme   <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Expenditure\/Cost<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Brexit Loan Scheme<\/td>       <td>The scheme will cost the Exchequer &euro;23m (&euro;14 million provided by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and &euro;9m provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine).<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Future Growth Loan Scheme<\/td>       <td>The scheme will cost the Exchequer &euro;62m (&euro;37 million from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and &euro;25m from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.).<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant<\/td>       <td>&euro;481,803 to 13\/01\/2020<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new markets<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,768,890 to 13\/01\/2020<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,053,152 to 13\/01\/2020<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics<\/td>       <td>&euro;284,233 to 13\/01\/2020<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding   the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience.<\/td>       <td>&euro;686,000 to 06\/01\/2020<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period.<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,698,104 to 13\/01\/2020 - (Since June 2016-2019 to date)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs<\/td>       <td>&euro;262,500 to 13\/01\/2020<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant   for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities<\/td>       <td>2018 Expenditure - &euro;560,275<br \/><br \/>1st Jan to 30th September <br \/><br \/>2019 Expenditure - &euro;432,458<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients<\/td>       <td>2018 Expenditure - &euro;951,129<br \/><br \/>1st Jan to 30th September 2019 <br \/><br \/>Expenditure - &euro;585,110<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring<\/td>       <td>There isn&rsquo;t a specific budget allocation for LEO Brexit mentoring.

To date, there have been 7,040 participants at LEO Brexit Information Events and 1,381 mentoring participants focused solely on Brexit. There have also been 1,720 participants in the customs training programme that the LEOs have rolled out for all businesses, exporters and importers, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland\u00a0(EI) is also providing Brexit-specific supports such as: the running of Brexit advisory clinics, at which there has been over 1,200 attendees to date; the EI Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; which is a support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise a report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience, and 359 &quot;Act on&quot; Plans have been completed to date; and the Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs Grant, to which there has been 250 applications made to date to access financial support through the scheme.<\/p><p>InterTradeIreland (ITI) has a focus on cross border trade in Ireland and provides a number of Brexit supports, including a Brexit advisory service. 5,416 SMEs directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019 and this is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018. <\/p><p>ITI also supports businesses through Brexit planning vouchers, worth up to &euro;2,250. These vouchers enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.\u00a0 To date 1,837 of such vouchers have been approved. Furthermore, in March 2019, ITI launched a Brexit implementation voucher, which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with ITI paying 50% of total expenditure. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.

The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions to. All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events relating to vaccination. Gardasil is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products. The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information. The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and\/or swelling at the point of injection and fever. Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents. Mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination are not unusual. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that all medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product. Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks. The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to reassure any persons who are suffering ill health that they are eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019, the HSE approved 31 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines\u00a0for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.\u00a0 The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has received an application\u00a0for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. In October 2018, the NCPE recommended that ocrelizumab not be reimbursed for this indication.\u00a0 The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\/Cannabidiol, THC\/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  There are three main steps to the application process:<\/p>  <p>- Step 1 is an application for a Care Needs Assessment. The Care Needs Assessment identifies whether or not the person needs long-term nursing home care. This is a key criteria and the HSE cannot make a determination on an application for State support under the Scheme unless a determination has been made that the person needs the relevant care services.<\/p>  <p>- Step 2 is an application for State Support. This is used to complete the Financial Assessment by the HSE which assesses the person&rsquo;s contribution to care and his\/her corresponding level of financial assistance. The Financial Assessment takes account of a person&rsquo;s income and assets in order to determine the person&rsquo;s contribution to their care.<\/p>  <p>- Step 3 is the decision to approve financial support for the applicant under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.<\/p>  <p>  Where a participant has assets that are included in the financial assessment, such as a principle private residence, the HSE will seek to establish the estimated market value of this asset. This can be done through valuation provided or through authorising a suitable person to carry out a valuation. The HSE is not bound by any valuation accompanying an application for State support.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants to the Scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. However, in order for financial support to be provided, the nursing home must have an available bed and be able to cater for the applicant's particular need. The HSE's Nursing Homes Support Offices can advise an applicant on the options available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500076#WRBB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500077#WRCC00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1577,"qnumday":544,"qnumall":"[2713\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500077#WRCC00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if legislation will be brought forward to ensure that the new income eligibility guidelines to qualify for the medical card as announced in budget 2020 are given legal effect; if the funding is in place to finance this measure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These plans have developed from Ireland&rsquo;s response to similar incidents such as pandemic influenza, SARS and MERS in the past. <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the declaration by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020 that the outbreak of Coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in accordance with the provisions of the International Health Regulations (2005), Ireland has been monitoring the situation since it originally arose in December, 2019. We have been preparing for the potential consequences since then.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To the greatest extent possible, in matters relating to emerging international public health incidents, Ireland follows the advice and guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and continues to do so as the situation evolves.<\/p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is the forum for managing the interface between the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive during the planning and response phases of a public health emergency. The NPHET is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer and held its first meeting in relation to Covid-19 on Monday 27 January and has continued to meet regularly since then.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an Expert Advisory Group provides scientific advice and assistance to the NPHET in carrying out its work.<\/p>  <p>  We are very conscious of\u00a0the impacts on other sectors outside of health.\u00a0Issues such as port health, travel advice, contingency planning, communications as well as advice and guidance to various sectors, including the public, are being kept under constant review.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also agreed to establish a Cabinet Committee (chaired by the Taoiseach), to assess the social and economic impacts of the potential spread of COVID-19. The work of the Cabinet Committee will include advice on downstream impacts, mitigations and contingencies for cross-sectoral issues and builds on the effective public health work undertaken to date. The cross-government approach to the coronavirus response will be based around cohesive decision-making, partnership, expert public health advice and clarity of communications.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health signed the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 53 of 2020) on Thursday 20th February 2020. These Regulations made provision for Covid-19 to be added to the list of notifiable diseases so that doctors will be obliged to notify the HSE when a case is suspected or diagnosed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is closely monitoring the emerging situation and is collaborating with the Department, other Departments and various agencies in relation to preparedness measures.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We have six cases in Ireland and three in Northern Ireland. The six cases in Ireland include two in the East and four in the West. All cases were identified and tested in line with established protocols for the investigation of suspect cases of Covid-19 and\u00a0all are associated with travel from an affected area in Northern Italy, rather than contact with another confirmed case. The HSE is working to identify contacts the patients may have had, to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread. None of the patients have been named publicly by the Department of Health or the HSE in order to protect patient confidentiality. We have also been working closely with the public health authorities in Northern Ireland and public health authorities have activated all appropriate contact tracing protocols.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team, at its meeting on 3 March 2020, has recommended the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Ireland&rsquo;s case definition remains the same. It will continue to be reviewed by the National Public Health Emergency Team as the global situation evolves;<\/p>  <p>  - On public health grounds, the travel advice for Italy is updated to advise against all non-essential travel to the following four regions: Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont;<\/p>  <p>  - Mass Gatherings Guidelines to be published in the coming days, following cross Government review;<\/p>  <p>  - The HSE now moves to a community testing model for assessment and investigation of suspect cases;<\/p>  <p>  - Four sub-groups have been established to review arrangements for vulnerable people, Health &amp;amp; Social Care Workers Protection, Acute Hospital Preparedness, Continuity of supply of Medicines and Medical Devices.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains in containment phase, where the focus is on identifying and isolating any possible cases and ensuring rigorous infection prevention and control and contact tracing procedures are in place.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Due to circumstances constantly evolving the Chief Medical Officer and NPHET will continue to communicate key public health messages to the public to keep them informed and up to date in relation to all matters concerning Covid-19.

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. The NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to improve access to inpatient\/daycase treatment and with a particular focus on hospital outpatient services. In this regard, I would encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to identify waiting list proposals this year. <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure the accuracy of waiting lists, good practice around the management of hospital waiting lists recommends periodic validation of waiting lists. Validation is the process whereby hospital administration contacts patients on waiting lists at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend a hospital appointment or wish to be removed. For a number of years validation was conducted at individual hospital level in Ireland but in 2018, I approved the establishment of the National Centralised Validation Unit (NCVU) within the NTPF. The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across all hospitals and across IPDC and OPD waiting lists. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore,  the National Scheduled Care Audit and Quality Assurance Review Programme was established in the NTPF in 2014 in conjunction with the National Director of Acute Hospitals, Health Service Executive. The main role of the AQA Team is to audit hospital waiting lists, ensuring that waiting list data returned by public hospitals is in compliance with national data reporting requirements and hospital practices are in compliance with national waiting list protocols and that the waiting list data returned by public hospitals is accurate. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, my Department has placed a particular priority on performance improvement in scheduled and unscheduled care in order to improve access for patients. At the end of 2017, a Unit was established in my Department with a remit to work with Departmental colleagues, the HSE and NTPF to provide strategic direction and drive a joint approach to performance oversight and innovation in this area. The monitoring of waiting lists is a key activity of this Unit. This includes weekly analysis of waiting list figures provided by the NTPF and regular governance meetings with the HSE and the NTPF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services","counter":2470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2471,"qnumday":882,"qnumall":"[3796\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the child mental health service will be improved nationwide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2472,"content":"<p>The development of all aspects of mental health services for young people remains a priority for Government. Mental health services, including those for young people, have benefited from significant additional investment over recent years. This has resulted in an overall provision of &euro;1.026 billion for HSE Mental Health services in 2020, reflecting an increase of &euro;315m since 2012 and an increase of &euro;39m over 2019.<\/p>  <p>  This additional funding has helped to increase the number of community-based CAMHS teams from 49 in 2008 to 71 today. The number of acute CAMHS beds has also increased, from 16 in 2008 to 74 in 2020. 30 additional beds are planned in the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital and at the new National Forensic Mental Health Service at Portrane. This will bring the total CAMHS beds nationally to 104. The new complex at Portrane is scheduled to open on a phased basis from September 2020, with the new forensic CAMHS Unit, the first of its kind nationally, due to come on-stream in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  There are acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist CAMHS staff, particularly Consultant Psychiatrists.  Intensive recruitment efforts are ongoing but there is currently a shortage of suitably qualified CAMHS Consultants both at national and European level.  Steady progress is being made by the HSE, however, in filling approved posts for mental health. <\/p>  <p>  From 2012 to 2019, demand for services increased substantially, with an increase of 24% in CAMHs referrals accepted. Despite this, the CAMHs waiting list increased by only 4% over this period. Reducing the CAMHS Waiting List is a priority for the HSE.  The CAMHS Waiting List nationally reduced from around 2,500 in December 2018 to around 2,300 in December 2019. This decrease has occurred, in part, due to new funding for 114 Assistant Psychologists and 20 Psychologists posts in Primary Care since 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2020 prioritises further CAMHS improvements, including increased integration with Primary Care; developing a 7-day-a-week service to ensure improved supports; enhancing early intervention and day hospital care; improving in-patient and community based services; ensuring greater promotion and use of talk therapies; and developing Eating Disorder and Mental Health Intellectual Disability services. Mental Health service delivery to young people will also improve through the use of such e-mental health initiatives as the recently introduced phone helpline, a new text line, and digital supports including online counselling.<\/p>  <p>  Further improvements for the planning and delivery of mental health services to young people are being progressed in the context of the refresh of A Vision For Change which has been completed and will be launched in the near future, along with updating the Mental Health Act 2001 which is now well advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":2473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2474,"qnumday":883,"qnumall":"[3797\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied that convenience computer stations available in some hospitals at which patients may access their personal information do not run the risk of having the information accessed by persons other than the individual patient; if steps have been taken to prevent same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2475,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2477,"qnumday":884,"qnumall":"[3798\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500094#WRAAA01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) can avail of the further surgery required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2478,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The priority of the Government, at this time, is to target supports where they can have the most effect in aiding Ireland's transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to the electric vehicle purchase grant the objective of the policy is to increase the number of electric vehicles on Ireland&rsquo;s roads as quickly and as efficiently as possible. As such, it is envisioned that the grant being provided for the vehicle, as opposed to just the battery, will increase initial purchases but also support the development of a second hand market for electric vehicles; an important consideration in terms of meeting demand but also in sustaining and continuing to promote electric vehicle prevalence in the Irish market. It is important in this regard for consumers to know that the market practices of buying and selling an electric vehicle are similar to those that are in place for vehicles which are non electric. <\/p>  <p>  In line with EU and international ambition, the Government will continue to promote this important technological shift for our transport sector and one of the key ways to do this is for consumers to see, in their everyday lives, as many electric vehicles as possible. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is not aware of large scale scrapping of electric vehicles early in the period of their useful life.

Our plan will:<\/p><p>- Group homes in the same area together to drive down cost<\/p><p>- Start with social homes owned by the local authorities, but will embrace privately owned homes in the wider community<\/p><p>- Develop smart finance options (e.g. loan guarantee models)<\/p><p>- Introduce easy pay back models (e.g. through your utility bill)<\/p><p>Budget 2020 provided &euro;20 million to commence this process, starting with groups of social homes in the Midlands to be upgraded at the same time. Private homeowners will be encouraged to participate through the provision of SEAI grants. The selection of the Midlands to start rolling out this plan is ideal because of the structural changes occurring there. <\/p><p>A cross-Departmental Taskforce that will drive the achievement of the Climate Action Plan target has been established. Development of the new model is being informed by the experience from existing schemes in Ireland including the Warmth and Wellbeing and Deep Retrofit Pilot schemes as well as best practice in other jurisdictions and extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement.<\/p><p>Government currently funds a number of grants and support schemes that are helping homeowners and businesses to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. The budget for these schemes in 2020 is &euro;146 million (capital and current), which is a record level of funding.<\/p><p>The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides fixed grants covering approximately 30% of the cost of works being carried out by a homeowner. Grants are provided for a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heat pumps, heating controls, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER). Grants range from &euro;300 for attic insulation up to &euro;6,000 for external insulation of a detached home. Full details of the amounts available towards each measure are available on SEAI&rsquo;s website: . In 2019, 18,531 homes received energy efficiency grants through this scheme with an average grant amount per home of &euro;1,238.<\/p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing pilot scheme is aiming to objectively measure and validate the health and wellbeing impacts of improving the living conditions of vulnerable people living in energy poverty with chronic respiratory conditions. Since 2016 1,244 homes have received free upgrades to their homes, including attic and wall insulation, window and door replacement and heating system upgrades where needed. According to SEAI, the average cost per home completed to date is &euro;22,800. An independent analysis is being carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in collaboration with the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme was launched in 2017 as a time bound pilot to investigate the challenges and opportunities of deep retrofit in Ireland. The scheme closed for applications in July 2019. To date 325 homes have all been upgraded to an A3 Building Energy Rating. According to SEAI, the average capital cost of works per home completed to date is &euro;54,047. Government funding of 50% of the cost (including project management and consultancy costs) was made available (with uplift to 95% of the cost for those at risk of energy poverty). The average grant paid was therefore &euro;31,778 per home completed.

This will achieve the twin goals of reducing congestion and reducing pollution.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to buses, bus lanes may also be used by cyclists who, as vulnerable road users, are safer in bus lanes than in general traffic.  The lanes may also, of course, be used by the emergency services.  Finally, after the lanes were originally introduced it was decided to allow taxis to use them.  This was a concession based on the fact that taxis are a form of public transport available for on-street hire.<\/p>  <p>  Since bus lanes were first introduced, there have been many requests to allow other classes of traffic to use the lanes.

","asker":"1598","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3049,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question. I am aware of potential challenges that some School-Age Childcare (SAC) services may face as legacy childcare schemes are phased out in favour of the National Childcare Scheme. As explained below, the policy intent of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) followed much consideration and aims to better serve children and families in the short, medium and long term. A number of mitigations were however also put in place to help services in this transitional phase to address these challenges.<\/p>  <p>  The Childcare Support Act, from which the NCS stems, includes a number of policy objectives related to combatting poverty and avoiding poverty traps which were inherent in the old schemes. The NCS provides that children will have access to development or education every day for a minimum of three hours, whether it is provided through school or subsidised Early Learning and Care (ELC). This is referred to as &lsquo;Standard Hours&rsquo;, and children are eligible if at least one parent or guardian is not in work, education or training. \u00a0Where both of a child&rsquo;s parents or guardians are in work, education or training, or their single parent in lone parent circumstances, the child may be eligible for up to eight hours of subsidised ELC per day. This level of eligibility is referred to as &lsquo;Enhanced Hours.&rsquo; Under Budget 2020, these will increase to four hours per day (20 per week) and nine hours per day (45 per week) respectively in September.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced Hours includes additional &lsquo;wrap-around&rsquo; hours on top of time spent in school or accessing ECCE; time spent in school or an ECCE service is subtracted from the total. Standard Hours do not &lsquo;wrap around&rsquo; school hours, however. Children eligible for Standard Hours will not be eligible for subsidised hours of care outside of school during term time, given that a parent\/guardian is at home and the child will have already received the development or education NCS is intended to provide to all children while at school. <\/p>  <p>  While there is a potential challenge for some School-Age Childcare services currently reliant on CCSP for their income, services have a number of options to consider. If a high proportion of their client-base will be eligible for Standard Hours only, they may no longer have enough children attending to be viable. Some of the parents may be incentivised to take up a training programme or some part-time work in which instance they will have access to 40\/45 hours per week for a younger child or 17\/22 hours for a school age child. Some geographical areas have a shortage of school-age childcare places. Services in these areas may be able to offer a service to new children. The School-Age Childcare Action Plan published in 2017 set out a range of actions to develop school-age childcare services. Subsidies available under the National Childcare Scheme are expected to create greater demand for these services and hence may compensate many services for loss of income from legacy schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, under Budget 2020, the existing &ldquo;saver&rdquo; arrangement was extended, to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme. In this Budget, additional funding was secured to extend the savers beyond August 2020. This means that persons who are registered on the CCS or TEC schemes before they close, and who retain their eligibility, will be able to remain on them indefinitely, for example, until they no longer require early learning and care or school age childcare. \u00a0Officials in my Department have been made aware of some confusion on this point in the sector, so it bears emphasis that the &lsquo;savers&rsquo; arrangement allows children registered for CCSP in November 2019 to continue accessing those subsidies for as long as they are eligible. This means that numbers of children accessing CCSP will gradually taper off rather than ceasing abruptly, giving services time to adapt. <\/p>  <p>  A new funding model for all services, and with a specific focus on catering to disadvantaged children, is also under development as part of First Five. My Department is currently supporting an international Expert Group and will begin a series of consultations with national stakeholders later this month. SAC services that experience challenges arising from the phasing out of CCSP, and which find that the wider benefits of the National Childcare Scheme have not compensated for this, may well be eligible for other funding supports under this new funding model when it is launched.<\/p>  <p>  Any SAC services that currently faces challenges &ndash; arising from any cause &ndash; are encouraged to access Case Management support. My Department oversees a Case Management process through which local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to services in difficulty. \u00a0All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500104#WRLLL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":3051,"qnumday":1083,"qnumall":"[2867\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500104#WRLLL01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of the affordable childcare scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3052,"content":"<p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), previously known\u00a0as the Affordable Childcare Scheme, provides the first statutory entitlement to financial support for childcare, opened to online applications on 20<sup>th<\/sup>November 2019.

The Scheme aims to:<\/p><p>- improve outcomes for children,<\/p><p>- reduce poverty,<\/p><p>- facilitate labour activation, and,<\/p><p>- tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families.<\/p><p>I am delighted with the very high volume of applications received so far. Over 29,700 applications, relating to over 38,800 children, have already been successfully submitted and over 33,600 awards have been\u00a0communicated to parents. These cover both universal and income based subsidies. Parents must bring this award to their childcare provider and once their provider has registered the details, payments begin to flow. <\/p><p>The Scheme provides the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for childcare.\u00a0 To date, 3,646 childcare services have contracted to provide the NCS. Over 4,000 providers availed of training in advance of the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.<\/p><p>&quot;Sponsored&quot; applications are now being processed under the Scheme, with over 100 completed sponsor applications received to date. The Childcare Support Act 2018 makes provision for referrals from sponsor bodies for children in certain disadvantaged or challenging circumstances.

A report of this review will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.

The Draft Childminding Action Plan is firmly based on the 2018 report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector ('Pathway to a Quality Support and Assurance System for Childminding'), which was chaired by Childminding Ireland and included a number of representatives from the early learning and care sector.<\/p>  <p>  Childminding is of huge importance to children, to parents, to our economy, and to our society. Until now, however, it has not received the support it deserves in terms of public funding or our system of quality assurance or regulation. The Draft Action Plan aims to recognise the valuable work that childminders do and to ensure they can access the supports they need. The Draft Action Plan sets out positive reform proposals to bring childminding into the mainstream of regulation, funding and support.<\/p>  <p>  I am very aware of the unique nature of a childminding service; that is why I established the expert group and called for the development of a bespoke plan for childminders. The Draft Childminding Action Plan makes clear that the intention is to develop regulations that are specific and appropriate to childminding, and to develop customised training and resources to support the quality of childminding provision, including through the development of staffed local networks to provide professional development and peer support. The new regulation and inspection process for childminders is yet to be developed, but the Draft Childminding Action Plan stresses the importance of regulation and inspection being proportionate and appropriate to the home and family setting in which childminders work.<\/p>  <p>  The public consultation process on the Draft Action Plan took place between August and November 2019. It\u00a0was widely publicised on social media, through National Voluntary Organisations (including Childminding Ireland) and City\/County Childcare Committees. The consultation process was carefully designed to ensure strong participation by childminders. In particular, a series of 32 focus groups were organised around the country by the local City and County Childcare Committees, with the help of the new team of regional Childminding Development Officers that I have put in place. The focus groups were organised in evenings to make it easier for childminders to take part. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the focus groups in the evenings, an Open Policy Debate took place in the daytime to facilitate participation by other stakeholders. There was also an online survey and a call for submissions. The online survey had 467 respondents, of whom 57% were childminders.<\/p>  <p>  A report on the consultation process is being finalised for publication. Revisions to the Draft Plan are currently being made in response to the consultation findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500104#WRLLL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Funding","counter":3074,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500104#WRLLL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":3075,"qnumday":1091,"qnumall":"[3342\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500104#WRLLL03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the childcare providers that her Department provided with a one-off payment to assist with insurance costs by county;

Commercial rates, at approximately &euro;1.5bn per annum, make up roughly a third of local government current (revenue) income.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are required by law to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details, entered in the valuation lists. The lists are prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.\u00a0Recognising the critical importance of commercial rates, I prioritised the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 for enactment last year. The Act modernises the rates system for both ratepayers and local authorities.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The levying and collection\u00a0of rates are matters for each individual local authority and the Minister for Finance has no direct function in the matter.\u00a0 The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The ARV is then applied to each property&rsquo;s valuation to obtain the amount payable in rates.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner for Valuation is currently conducting a national programme of revaluation to provide consistent, up-to-date valuations so that rates are equitably distributed. Revaluation results in a redistribution of the commercial rates liability between ratepayers. While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the local authority. It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the commercial rates collected. Interestingly, in terms of revaluations to date, I understand that the trend is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have experienced a decrease.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  After a revaluation of a local authority area, the Minister, with\u00a0the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is required to make a Rates Limitation Order (RLO) to ensure that the overall rates collected in that area for the following year, does not increase beyond set parameters, for example, taking account of\u00a0normal inflation.\u00a0RLOs have been made for each of the 23 local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and will be made in respect of the remaining local authorities where revaluations are to be concluded in the coming years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At all stages of the process, ratepayers are consulted and informed and can bring relevant information to bear on the valuation. Ultimately ratepayers have a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal and beyond that to the Courts on a point of law.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulties with the payment of commercial rates.\u00a0 In this regard, local authorities may facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options. The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 further facilitates such flexible approaches, on the basis that ratepayers engage with the local authority concerned.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, Section 15 the new Act also provides for a rates waiver schemes, to be decided by local authority members in order to promote national and\/or local policy objectives, including for example, local area plans under the Planning and Development Act 2000 and local economic and community plans under the Local Government Act 2001.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Prior to local authorities deciding their 2020 budgets, my Department wrote to all local authorities highlighting the new waiver provisions, contained in the 2019 Act, indicating that the work in respect of commencing Section 15 is underway and\u00a0to make a provision in their budgets if they planned to implement a waiver scheme in 2020. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Last October I, along with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, met with members of the Retail Consultation Forum and it was agreed that a separate meeting on Commercial Rates and Valuation could be beneficial in sharing experiences and working together to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commercial Rates and Valuation regimes. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department proposes to convene such a meeting between representatives of the Retail Consultation Forum, the Valuation office and local authorities to explore a number of thematic issues such as sustainable development, through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s cities, towns and villages; the experience of retail ratepayers in terms of valuation and rates at a systemic level; and the implementation of the Rates and Other Matters Act 2019.<\/p>  <p>  As a first step,\u00a0my Department has sought initial input from the members of the Retail Consultation Forum to the development of an agenda for this engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500109#WRQQQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1510"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":3356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500109#WRQQQ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":3357,"qnumday":1185,"qnumall":"[3282\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500109#WRQQQ01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason for the drop in funding for County Galway despite its size compared to counties of a similar size, for example, County Cork which receive more; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3358,"content":"<p>Local\u00a0authorities derive their income from a variety of\u00a0central and local sources including from commercial rates, charges for goods and services and Exchequer funding from Central Government. <\/p><p>Central Government funding of local authorities includes transfers, both current and capital, coming from a wide range of Departments and Offices, not solely from my Department, for a variety of purposes.

In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. <\/p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner \/ co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature.

Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020.<\/p><p>The regulations came into operation on 31 January 2020, and my Department is currently in the process of finalising guidelines, which will be available in the coming weeks, to promote and support a consistent approach to the operation and administration of the defective concrete blocks grant scheme by Donegal and Mayo County Councils. The aim now is to commence the receipt of applications without delay.<\/p><p>The defective concrete blocks grant scheme is primarily a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks. \u00a0The scheme outlines five remedial options ranging from\u00a0rebuilding on existing foundations to replacing of external walls. The\u00a0maximum approved \u00a0costs per dwelling under the scheme\u00a0range from &euro;275,000 to &euro;55,000 depending on the remedial option. A grant of 90% of the approved costs associated with the necessary remediation works, subject to a maximum for each remedial option, or 90% of the actual cost of the remedial works, whichever is the lesser, is available under the scheme.<\/p><p>The scheme is targeted\u00a0at assisting a restricted group of homeowners who have no other practicable options to access redress.\u00a0It is not a compensation scheme and the regulations apply only in respect of qualifying works that have not commenced prior to confirmation of grant approval being issued in respect of a dwelling by the relevant local authority. Homeowners cannot seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken either prior to the commencement, or outside, of the scheme. This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement.<\/p><p>Budget 2020 provides funding of &euro;40 million to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme. Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process and additional funding can be provided should it be required. Mindful that the scheme is being funded from the Exchequer the scope of the scheme cannot be open ended. The funding available must be used prudently to achieve the most efficient and cost effective\u00a0outcomes.<\/p><p>Separately, the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013, provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme to be implemented by the Board with support from the Housing Agency. The pyrite remediation scheme was first adopted in February 2014. <\/p><p>While the Act provides that the scheme can be amended, replaced or revoked, this can only be done in accordance with the scope of the Act. The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance, e.g. such as pyrite or mica\u00a0in concrete blocks. <\/p><p>The Pyrite Remediation Scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie.<\/p><p>In regard to planning permission and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme,\u00a0 the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended), provide that &ldquo;development&rdquo; includes any associated demolition works. Consequently, the demolition and rebuild of\u00a0affected\u00a0dwellings will require planning permission. However, requirements regarding planning permission and contributions are ultimately a matter for the relevant planning authority, who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.<\/p><p>Finally, the Building Regulations (as amended), apply to the construction of new buildings, extensions and material alterations to existing buildings. The five remedial options provided for under the defective concrete blocks grant scheme\u00a0constitute a material alteration to an existing building. <\/p><p>Any works that are beyond the requirements of the current building regulations for existing dwellings, or any works that are not required for or ancillary to the remediation of damage to the dwelling arising out of, or in connection with, the use of defective concrete blocks in its construction, while not prohibited,\u00a0do not qualify for grant assistance under the scheme. In this context, energy upgrades beyond the requirements of the current building regulations for\u00a0 existing dwellings, do not qualify for grant assistance under this scheme.<\/p><p>Similarly, in line with Government policy on waste prevention and value for money considerations, the reuse, recovery and recycling of materials, is encouraged where possible.\u00a0The costs associated with the unnecessary replacement of items such as windows, doors and kitchen units, do not qualify for grant assistance under this scheme.<b><\/b><\/p><p>The primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500110#WRRRR03875","answer":true,"speaker":"1554"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":3443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500110#WRRRR03900"},{"type":"question","counter":3444,"qnumday":1214,"qnumall":"[3151\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500110#WRRRR04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of a project (details supplied) in County Mayo; and the extra resources which will be made available to Mayo County Council to develop this project.","asker":"1602","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3445,"content":"<p>On 30 May 2017, the Government designated 284 hectares of lands at Ireland West Airport Knock (IWAK) as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) under Section 166 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).<\/p>  <p>  The preparation of a Planning Scheme in respect of an SDZ is a function of the relevant development agency, under Section 168 of the Act.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On 29 May 2019, the specified development agency, in this case Mayo County Council, published the draft planning scheme for the SDZ for public consultation for six weeks, closing on 12 July 2019, in accordance with Section 169 of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  The Chief Executive of the planning authority submitted a report on submissions and observations received during the consultation period for consideration by the Council and on 9 September 2019, the planning authority made the IWAK SDZ Planning Scheme.

Where works are carried out in accordance with the guidance in TGD B, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part B. <\/p>  <p>  The design of apartments, in Ireland, has been evolving over recent years, as design teams learn from best practice around the world. In particular, open plan apartments are becoming increasingly popular. TGD B 2006 did not provide specific guidance on open plan apartment arrangements. In 2018, following liaison with Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB), a working group of experts from DFB and\u00a0my Department was set up to examine the issue of open plan apartments in Ireland and develop appropriate guidance.<\/p>  <p>  In developing the additional guidance, standards, tests, engineering approaches were considered and fire safety requirements in a number of jurisdictions, including England, Scotland, America, Australia, Denmark and Hong Kong were reviewed. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the additional national guidance is to provide both local authorities and industry with greater clarity on how to achieve and demonstrate compliance with Part B\u00a0for open plan apartments and to promote consistency across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The additional guidance amending TGD B 2006 published in February 2020 has a number of provisions for buildings containing apartments and includes a new section specifying provisions for open plan apartments. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to internal layouts and provisions for open plan apartments with travel distances exceeding 9m, the guidance provides for\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - sprinkler\u00a0protection within the apartment to control fire development; <\/p>  <p>  - maximum travel\u00a0distances within the apartment of 20m;\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - single storey\u00a0apartments only;<\/p>  <p>  - an enhanced fire detection and alarm systems within the apartment;\u00a0interconnected alarms in circulation areas, bedrooms and high risk areas\u00a0to ensure early detection and warning of a fire; and <\/p>  <p>  - enclosed kitchens or a distance of 1.8m from the main kitchen cooking appliances to\u00a0the escape route, which is in line with international research and testing.<\/p>  <p>  For smaller apartments, with travel distances less than or equal to 9m, the guidance in TGD B has not changed. TGD B has referenced BS 5588 Part 1: 1990 since the introduction of Building Regulations in 1991, and this continues to be applicable. In these apartments, the travel distances from the flat entrance door to any point in any habitable room cannot exceed 9 m, no habitable room can be an inner room, the position of any cooking facilities should be remote from the dwelling entrance door and not prejudice the escape route from any point in the apartment. This typically applies to small studio type flats with open internal layouts. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the additional guidance to TGD B published in February 2020 does not permit a distance of 1.8 metres from the escape route to the main kitchen cooking appliance in non-sprinklered apartments.\u00a0 It should also be noted that an escape route from a bedroom cannot be through a kitchen in a non-sprinklered apartment, as no habitable room can be an inner room in accordance with BS 5588 Part 1: 1990, as currently referenced in TGDB. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the additional guidance to TGD B published in February 2020 provides guidance on other aspects of fire safety for buildings containing apartments and these are set out at the beginning of reprint TGD B 2020.\u00a0 All of the guidance in TGD B (Reprint 2020) should be considered collectively, as fire safety must be addressed in a holistic manner, considering building resilience and ensuring a building is safe for occupant egress and firefighter operations simultaneously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500111#WRSSS02675","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":3496,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500111#WRSSS02700"},{"type":"question","counter":3497,"qnumday":1232,"qnumall":"[3341\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020030500111#WRSSS02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of revisions being made to the social housing application form to identify the need for wheelchair suitable housing; when he expects the revised application form to be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1563","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3498,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department has been engaged in a process of revision of the social housing application form in collaboration with the local authority sector.

When the RIHL was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years. The RIHL proved to be more successful than initially anticipated and following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform\u00a0an increase in funding of &euro;363.6 million for 2018-2019 was communicated to all 31 local authorities on 15\u00a0August 2019. <\/p><p>When the RIHL was introduced on 1 February 2018 three interest rate products were offered:<\/p><p>1.  variable interest rate priced at 2.3%; <\/p><p>2. A 25 year fixed rate priced at 2%<\/p><p>3. A 30 year fixed rate priced at 2.25%<\/p><p>From August 2019 the variable interest rate was no longer offered as part of the scheme.<\/p><p>Loans issued under the RIHL must be on a prudential basis so as to protect the financial interests of both borrowers and local authorities, and I have highlighted in the past that this could, for future tranches of funding, result in changes to the operation of the scheme, including inter alia interest rates, depending on the performance of the loan.<\/p><p>An independent review of the RIHL was undertaken in 2019 by\u00a0the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). This review\u00a0strongly endorsed the RIHL as a positive affordability measure. However, it\u00a0recommended that the cost of the RIHL should be comparable to that of\u00a0the longest fixed rate mortgage available in Ireland, which is typically 10 years.<\/p><p>Accordingly,\u00a0following engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the interest rate on RIHL mortgages increased by 0.745%. This increase will not apply to loans issued on applications received before 15 January 2020.
