I am seeking the approval of the committee for the Supplementary Estimate allocating a total of &euro;1.362 billion to provide the necessary additional funding of &euro;1.212 billion to subhead B11, electricity credit, and &euro;150 million to subhead B13, emergency generation capacity, both of which are in the energy transformation programme.  I am also requesting approval to reallocate &euro;7 million as follows: &euro;6 million for subhead A7, climate initiatives; and &euro;1 million for subhead B6, other energy programmes, national and international.<\/p><p>This reallocation is possible due to savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership area under subhead A4, environmental and climate research, where savings of &euro;2.5 million have been identified; subhead A5, carbon fund, where savings of &euro;3.5 million have been identified; and subhead C3, mining and petroleum services, where savings of &euro;1 million have been identified.<\/p><p> The Government took steps earlier this year to help alleviate the burden on households of the rapidly increasing energy costs when we provided for a credit of &euro;200, including VAT, to be applied to domestic customers' energy bills under the first electricity costs emergency benefits scheme.  However, electricity and gas prices have continued to rise due to international conditions, in particular the current challenges arising from the crisis in Ukraine, and indications are that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p> The Government has taken action in budget 2023 to provide further assistance to those who are most vulnerable to the effects of the cost-of-living crisis.  A wide range of measures were introduced, including a &euro;600 electricity credit to be applied in three instalments between November 2022 and April 2023.  Additional social welfare payments totalling &euro;1.2 billion across a number of benefits and schemes will support in the region of 1.5 million people over the coming winter period.  Further measures introduced by the Government involved significant support for commuters and students.  The reduced public transport fares announced previously are to be extended to the end of 2023 and a number of measures have been put in place to help eligible students with academic fees.<\/p><p> In light of the continued increase in household energy bills, the Government has decided to support domestic customers further through a second electricity benefit scheme for this winter.  The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Act 2022 provided for the electricity credit to be made under the scheme on a once-off basis in 2022.  Therefore, new legislation was required for this scheme to be established.  The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, which provides the legal basis for the new scheme, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 13 October and was signed by the President into law.  The new scheme will be closely modelled on the previous one and an electricity costs emergency benefit payment of &euro;200, including VAT, for an estimated 2.2 million domestic accounts is to be paid in each of the November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023 electricity billing cycles, totalling &euro;600, including VAT, per domestic electricity account.  This scheme will have a ceiling of &euro;1.211 billion and within this, a contingency has been included to ensure there is no shortfall to cover the increase in any new domestic customers during the period of the scheme.  The scheme will be operated by ESB Networks which will make payments to the individual energy supplies.  Those suppliers will, in turn, credit individual domestic electricity accounts.  The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will be charged with oversight of the scheme.<\/p><p> A further &euro;1 million will be allocated for those domestic customers whose households many not have an individual meter point reference number, MPRN.  Upon completion of the previous electricity credit scheme, the need to have an MPRN resulted in certain cohorts not being able to access the payment.  A particular cohort since identified includes some Traveller families in certain local authority accommodations where the MPRN is registered to the local authority and supplies multiple households.  Work is under way to establish an alternative mechanism to ensure the payment reaches these Traveller families.<\/p><p> VAT must be applied on the electricity bill balance after the credit has been applied.  On that basis, the credit of &euro;183.49 is being applied exclusive of VAT on each account.  Inclusive of VAT, the total reduction on each household electricity bill will be &euro;200.<\/p><p> Earlier this year, the CRU directed EirGrid, the transmission system operator, to procure some 450 MW of additional temporary generation capacity for winter 2023-24 through to winter 2025-26 to offset a potential capacity shortfall of electricity supply.  The temporary generation capacity may be extended to winter 2026-27, if necessary.  To comply with this direction, EirGrid requires financial support from the Exchequer.  Legislation to ensure EirGrid can carry out this direction, including the legal basis for my Department providing the necessary financial support, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas in July of this year and was signed into law by the President.<\/p><p> The level of financial support required in 2022 to allow EirGrid place orders on the electricity generation units and to ensure they are delivered and installed in time for winter 2023-24 was estimated at &euro;350 million.  As the final level of financial support required in 2022 was not known earlier this year as the contractual arrangements were still at an early stage at that time, it was agreed that approval of the allocation of funding for the emergency generation capacity would be requested in two tranches.  A previous allocation request of &euro;200 million was granted in July with the indicative funding request for the initial stages of the project, with a further request forecasted to be required in the autumn of &euro;150 million when the contractual details were close to finalisation.  These contracts are now ready to be finalised subject to final terms being agreed and the balance of funding being available.  The &euro;150 million balance of funding represents the final agreed figures required by EirGrid for the purchase of the generation equipment and balance of the plant this year.<\/p><p> The total cost of the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme is, as I said, estimated at &euro;1.212 billion and the balance of funding for the emergency power generation scheme is &euro;150 million.  As the additional funding of &euro;1.362 billion required is being provided from the Exchequer, the main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to allocate &euro;1.212 billion to subhead B11 and &euro;150 million to subhead B13 in the energy transformation programme area to fund the two measures.<\/p><p> In addition to the approval for the Exchequer funding for the two schemes, I am also seeking approval to reallocate &euro;7 million within subheads in my Vote to provide for expenditure for a number of other measures.<\/p><p> Local authorities have a particularly important role in the delivery of both climate mitigation and adaptation.  This is reflected in the provisions of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, which requires each local authority to prepare a local authority climate action plan, specifying the mitigation and the adaptation measures to be adopted by the local authority.  These plans will be updated once every five years.  The first of these plans is due to be submitted by each local authority by the end of 2023.  This funding will allow the Department to establish a governance structure with local authorities for the development and reporting of these climate actions plans.  I am seeking approval to provide funding of &euro;3.5 million in 2022 through the allocation of savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership programme area.<\/p><p> My Department has secured support from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, for a climate-specific round of the sound and vision scheme to address the need to fund programming specific to the climate crisis.  This programming will contribute to an important component of delivering on the national dialogue&rsquo;s objective of improving climate literacy.  Improving climate literacy will enhance the capacity of people to make small changes in their daily lives, engage with climate action at a local level in their communities and at national level in the co-design of policy.  Through the expertise of the BAI and the vision of Ireland&rsquo;s programme makers, we will ensure the delivery of a range of innovative and creative programming to bring climate awareness, literacy and empowerment into homes across the country.  To facilitate this, I am seeking approval to provide funding of &euro;2.5 million in 2022 through allocating savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership programme area.<\/p><p> The national energy security framework published earlier this year places a significant emphasis on the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy to underpin Ireland's security of supply.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the planning system is fully supportive of the roll-out of renewables, something first expressed in action No. 102 of the climate action plan 2021.<\/p><p> As part of its ongoing effort to improve the delivery of its service, An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently provided the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with a specific resource plan for the area of maritime development and climate action, including the establishment of the marine and climate directorate.  The total funding requirement for the establishment of the new functions is expected to be in the region of &euro;3.5 million and my Department is committing to provide &euro;1 million in once-off funding in 2022 to support the set-up of this function.  I am seeking approval to provide this contribution under subhead B6, other energy programmes (national and international), in 2022 through allocating savings identified in subhead C3, mining and petroleum services.<\/p><p> I am happy to take questions from the committee on any aspect of this Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#A00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

We will go back for second and third rounds as necessary.<\/p><p> I refer to the funding for local authorities and the public bodies carrying out their duties and the remit they would have.  This question could probably extend to the funding for An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well.  The local authorities, in a broad level, are responsible for a lot of climate action through transport and housing.  Decisions that local authorities take have an impact on housing and transport emissions.  However, a narrower view is to look at the operational side of a local authority.  Do the local authorities take a broader or narrower view in their climate action plans?  It is one thing for all public buildings in a local authority area to have low energy lighting, but there is a bigger impact of the local authorities in terms of climate.  That question could probably extend to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well, where the line is drawn between its operational remit and its broader remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#B00200","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>This payment is part of a five-year programme that will see significant ramping up, not just this first payment, but further larger payments, so that they can meet the requirements of the Act.  I have been travelling around the country as best as I can talking to different local authorities to encourage them in that work and listening to what they have to say on the resources they need.  This is a response.  I also told them that they should take broad perspective as to what their role is; it is not just about how they manage their own energy use within their buildings, fleets and so on.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of wider considerations.  One of the areas where we have huge potential for decarbonisation development and improving our citizens&rsquo; lot is through the development of the likes of district heating.  It can only be the local authority, particularly through its development process, that can look to target and identify, and then facilitate, support and, in many instances, manage the roll-out of such systems.  That then can be applied across a wide variety of different areas, including transport and energy.  It can be applied not only in district heating but also in improvement of their housing stock and the provisions within the development plan around renewable power generation and grid development.  Once one starts looking at it, the list of where local authorities can and should have a key role is significant.<\/p> <p>  That is connected, in a sense, to the economic development role of local authorities.  This is where a new economy and opportunities will develop.  Those councils and authorities that are ahead of the curve in being part of the decarbonisation programme will see more investment, more jobs and a wider rate base.  To answer the Chair&rsquo;s question, their function should not be seen narrowly as being about the emissions that they are directly responsible for, but rather in that wider remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that.

I thank the Minister for coming.  I congratulate him on the measures that he brought in in the budget, which the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, confirmed will protect the estimated 29% who at risk of energy poverty.  They are very welcome.  It is over the winter period and we need to revisit some of these things.  I welcome the new measures the Minister is announcing.  will come back to them.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  In respect of the energy credit going to householders, has the Minister at this stage been able to estimate how much we might recoup from the EU measures that are now in the offing?  That is, the capping of the price of electricity for the non-gas providers and the solidarity tax on the fossil fuel, and perhaps the longer-term market reform that is coming.<\/p> <p>  On the emergency temporary provision, how is the state aid being structured?  Is this a price commitment in terms of supporting the price that would be paid a capital allocation?  It will be there for just four winters at most, although this sort of equipment, presumably, has a 20-year life span or something of that nature.  What happens after that?  It seems that it would be very expensive and wasteful to take it out of the Irish system.  How is that going to happen?<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister have line of sight on the features that stalled the last auction &ndash; things such as planning, availability of equipment and compliance with environmental requirements?  Do we have clear line of sight to the effect that none of those things will obstruct this?<\/p> <p>  My final questions are on the sound and vision initiative.  As the Minister knows, I am strongly advocating for a resilience campaign around our reliance on imports.  I would like to hear that is going beyond just talking about climate and looking at the practical things that can be done.<\/p> <p>  In the context of local authority planning, no local authority, to my knowledge, has yet put in place a public electric vehicle charger with the grant that the Government makes available to them.  I know that has been changed.  However, it suggests there is a bit of a disconnect between the emergency that people are facing and the attitude of local authorities.  Can the Minister bring a little urgency into this, along with the allocation of the extra money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The amount of money raised from the measures that we have agreed at European Council, such as the inframarginal pricing and the solidarity contribution of fossil fuels, is hard to estimate exactly because it depends on so many different variables &ndash; the price of gas and, as a consequence, wholesale electricity prices.  The good news is that while they are still historically incredibly high prices, it is a fraction now of what the prices were two or three months ago.  The reduction is welcome, however, it still leaves us in a difficult situation.  It would also depend, to a certain extent, on the timelines that supply whether the measures are extended beyond original provisions and also the rates and levels that apply.  The European Union is recommending that it is beyond &euro;180 per MWh that inframarginal pricing would kick in and this windfall would be gained.  However, we have the capability of lowering that and that is something we are looking at.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, on the contribution, the European Commission is recommending 35%, or setting that as within the terms, but recognising that it could go higher.  As I said, there is work ongoing with the Department of Finance and my Department to get the details on this.  We have to have it in place before the end of the year.  We want the revenue in quickly.<\/p> <p>  I expect the inframarginal revenue to go towards reducing electricity bills directly.  That would be the best use of it.  The solidarity contribution may be useful in the context of wider supports.  We are looking at including business supports and so on.  As already stated, I estimate that it will be between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion, but we will have more specifics on that in the coming weeks when we agree the final details, the timelines and so on.<\/p><p>With regard to the emergency purchasing of aeroderivative jet engines, I thank the Chair and the committee for their involvement.  The timeline and speed of progressing the legislation, along with the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny for aspects of this, which we have had to do, has been extraordinary.  It is unfortunate and we would prefer not to be in this situation.  We are doing it to make sure that we have sufficient power supply next winter.  The provisions came from the CRU asking that EirGrid would purchase the equipment.  We are supporting that.  It is the last resort.  The timeline potentially goes to the winter of 2026-27, as I said in my opening remarks.  The expectation is that the generators deploying them would have to sell on the relevant equipment.  In my mind, we can probably recoup revenue to recover some of these costs.  We have not provided for this because it is an unknown.  I expect there will be a significant return to Revenue when that is done, and then, as the Deputy said, that equipment can then be used in a range of other operations.  My expectation and preference is that it will be used on the island of Ireland because we will need fast-reacting open-cycle distillate, gas-fired or hydrogen-fired backup generation, which is what the equipment that we will contract in the coming days or weeks will provide.  We are not providing for it in the Estimates because it is an unknown, but I expect there will be a significant return to the State at the end of this emergency process, when it is unwound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00600","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

It is too complicated and some of its provisions are too contradictory.  That is the first and most urgent lesson that we learned.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding the sound and vision fund.  The definition of how that applies to climate and the reduction of our dependence on fossil fuels is central to our current climate difficulties.

I have a couple of quick questions.  The first relates to an issue he touched on.  How will those without a meter point reference number, MPRN, get their electricity grant?  It seems from reading his submission that he has not quite figured out how that will be dispensed.  Will he comment on whether that will definitely go to the Traveller community, which did not get to avail of it last time, and how that will be done?  I will raise another matter again, which is a hot political topic at the moment.  How will the Minister guarantee that there are no disconnections of those with prepaid meters or those with hefty bills from district heating systems, where much higher tariffs apply?<\/p> <p>  The main question that I want to ask is about the emergency generation plans and the &euro;350 million that is being voted.  Some &euro;200 million has been spent and there is &euro;150 million for the autumn.  That is all done and dusted.  It is necessary, but it bothers me that there is no scrutiny of why it is necessary.  We need to revisit that.  The Minister is looking far into the future to 2026, 2027 and 2028, when we may still require this type of plant, yet the State is continuing to connect data centres to the grid when we know that they are soaking up increasingly large volumes of energy.  Should we not, at some point, stop scrambling to purchase extra equipment but instead stop the connection of extra data centres when we know that they are the cause of the increase in our energy use?  The Minister mentioned the war in Ukraine, but the data centre issue is extraneous to that and we have information from the CRU that shows our electricity demand has grown by 9% over the past five years compared with 27 EU countries, which have approximately 0% growth in their energy demand.  Ours is continually growing, which is clearly because of the growth of the data centre industry here.<\/p> <p>  My last question is about climate research.  Why do we have money back from climate research?  Why did we not spend the funding when we know from the biodiversity report that there is little hard evidence on the decline of many species in this country and that we should research that and spend the funding to examine how and why this is happening so that we can try to redress the problem and protect endangered species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#D00400","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I confirm that we will make sure that Traveller families will get the cash payments that 99.5% or 99.6% of households got in the first tranche.  We know that it works.  Where there were anomalies or communities were left out, such as certain families within the Traveller community, we will work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and with local authorities to make sure that they get the payment this autumn just like every other household.<\/p> <p>  Disconnections are a critical issue.  We recognise that it may be a difficult period for a variety of different customers, whether they are on bill pay schemes or not.  Many families with pay-as-you-go services find that it is a useful mechanism.  We should be careful not to depict all the problems as being in just one sector.  Many people with bill pay services also have difficulties and we have to protect them.  The mechanisms to help families on pay-as-you-go services first and foremost involve having a good, close relationship with the supplier and the application of the support mechanisms that it has in place to ensure that households do not have to disconnect themselves in a way that they do not want to.  CRU has developed a range of other measures, including the right to access lower tariffs.  One measure that we will look at from our energy poverty action plan, which will be published in the next few weeks, is a review of gas connections as well as electricity to see if there are measures to take there to improve people's situations, particularly the relatively small number of but still important households which have hardship meters.  How do we get better provisions for them?  We have not finished introducing measures to help those households.  We will continue to review and to make sure that the State helps them through what will be a difficult winter period.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why we need to switch off the scheme and why we would not keep generators running in 2028 and 2029.  This is an emergency measure.  It is not the only measure in place.  We also have the T-4 and T-3 auctions.  The majority of the 2 GW of backup gas-fired power will come through those auction processes.  We need a significant investment, which we are now seeing, in battery storage and additional renewables, through the renewable energy strategy.  That is working and it is delivering.  The volume of power from renewable power generation has never been as significant as this year.  That is how we will make sure that we do it.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that we had a problem with having to make sure that any new data centres fit in within our energy security and climate targets.

We recognise that it was an issue.<\/p><p>We have acted to change the rules and approach the State takes to contracting new data centres.  It is not saying \"No\".

The scale of the price increases has put people right across society in real difficulty.  Often people may be outside the social welfare system and in various circumstances, and I think it is appropriate they get a payment during these difficult times.  Once we start to do that, then, do we agree to undertake provisions through electricity bills?  I ask this because it would not be possible to do it through gas payments, because only 42% of households have gas connections, or any other mechanism.  It was appropriate to take this approach.<\/p> <p>  The cost to start differentiating, the time delay and the bureaucratic complications involved in trying to change the entire database system, or to try to manipulate it to categorise payments based on income or on whether it is a first or second home, would not have delivered the credit in time.

The payment next month, on 1 November, will come just at the right time.

This is how we could have got money into people's pockets very quickly.  The MPRN scheme took months the last time before the money hit people's accounts.

This strategy was submitted to us last year.  The authors worked out and identified the supports in this regard.  This Supplementary Estimate is now responding to that endeavour.  It has taken the analysis provided to us regarding what capacity requirements local authorities have and has suggested ways of funding it.  This approach encompasses all 31 local authorities delivering phase 1.

Stakeholder engagement is also involved.<\/p> <p>  There are two key specialised resource requirements.

I ask him for his views on prepay meters.  He is leaving much to the CRU.  Many people on these prepay meters are actually paying a higher tariff for their electricity.  They are also paying a higher standing charge.  That seems extremely unfair because the provider is actually guaranteed payment whereas if someone had an ordinary meter, the provider is not guaranteed payment until it is actually paid.  Has the Minister asked the CRU the justification for them having the right to charge a higher rate?  One would think people with a prepay meter should actually get it at a discounted rate.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the extra money allocated to reduce public transport fares for students and commuters.  That is great, but the policy is only as good as it works out in practice and there seems to be a big gap between the policy and the practice particularly in north Kildare.  My home town has Maynooth University.  I am inundated with students who are delighted with the reduced transport charge but they cannot get the buses.  The buses are full or they are not turning up.  Sometimes they are standing up and in the case of an accident they would be like human missiles.  The buses are full.  The policy is great, but more work needs to be done on delivery so that it works in practice.  How does the transport plan work with the living with Covid a plan?  Many drivers are not able to turn up to work because they have Covid.

What the Deputy said is true; buses are starting to fill up.  The numbers using public transport are rising significantly on the back of the end of the Covid pandemic, but also as a result of lower fares.  Many bus services are not providing the reliable services that we expect.  It is the role of the National Transport Authority and my Department to ensure that they do.  This has included the issuing of fines for companies which have not applied.  Many of the difficulties have related to the ability to get drivers.  We are considering further measures for how we can help to support and facilitate that.  I absolutely accept it is not satisfactory particularly when buses do not turn up on schedule and people are left at the stop which can also lead to buses being over-full.  We need to change that.<\/p> <p>  The issue of prepay meters is complex.  There are different circumstances for gas and electricity.  Different types of meters are involved.  There are also different types of customers.  Many people are using prepay meters because it provides a very useful service.  It is a very attractive way to manage paying and for many people reducing energy use and their bills.  The complexity of that is that a number of different companies are involved.  Not every company uses prepay meters but those that do have a variety of tariffs, often better and innovative tariffs to support customers.  The standing charge and the per-use charge vary because suppliers try to attract customers with that.  There is an issue with those who are in difficulty.  We need to address that and the CRU has done a lot of work already.<\/p> <p>  Included in that is the requirement to ensure that those who are in difficulty are not paying the highest charges.  As we go through this winter, we will try to ensure that the discounted tariffs are made available to those most in need of them as well as other supports.  In two weeks' time we will publish an energy action plan which will outline further measures that we may seek to deliver in conjunction with the CRU.  We are doing considerable work monitoring the consumer protection measures.  We will not rest with whatever is there.  It means looking at it and ensuring we adjust if people are left in difficulties.  We do not want anyone disconnected this summer, least of all those at risk of fuel poverty who do not have the heat and the power that they need.<\/p> <p>  Officials from my Department are meeting both suppliers and the NGOs to understand the issues on the ground.

It is clear that the solidarity contribution will only in effect really apply to one company, the Corrib gas field.  With inframarginal it is complex because there are generating companies, such as wind farms, but they may have sold on power through a long-term contract at low rates to a supplier company or supplier-like company.  We are saying we will not just apply inframarginal pricing to the generating companies, but we will also apply it to those suppliers and supplier-like companies if they are gaining a windfall profit from these very high market prices for fossil fuel and gas.<\/p><p>Then one is into the complexity of each different generator in terms of what its arrangements are.

It is clear that these problems have escalated considerably since the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  My staff and myself, the vast majority of whom are parents, do our utmost to care for and help these children but we are not experts; we are not psychologists and we are not mental health professionals, and that is the type of help many of our pupils need.  The services providing mental health support to children, while excellent when we can access them, are completely inadequate and understaffed.  Children are suffering and getting worse the longer they must wait for expert help.  This must change.  The way I see it, a number of key areas must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The first is the provision of supports to help children to access learning.  The second is the reduction in long waiting lists and waiting times to access external support services.  The third is to increase capacity for early intervention.  Above all, there needs to be joined-up thinking.<\/p><p> I am a member of the Irish Primary Principals' Network and I am representing it today.  I echo the calls in the IPPN submission for a seamless, integrated approach across health and education and for teams of health and education professionals to work with school clusters and individual schools to support children directly in the schools where they learn.  Sufficient capacity and timely access to supports for children are key, while training and support to develop a culture of well-being in schools are also needed. <\/p><p> While the pandemic has made things worse, it is not as though things were great before March 2020.  We have children who are bereaved or whose family unit has fallen apart due to addiction, mental ill health or divorce and separation.  There are children who are homeless, who are living in direct provision or who have fled war-torn countries.  My school has supported children in all of these scenarios.  Some of those children have experienced several of these adverse childhood experiences and traumas simultaneously.<\/p><p> However, there are times when the needs of these children lie far beyond that which schools alone can provide.  This is the point where external support is needed and, too often, it is the point where children are failed.  We know that for children who are experiencing mental health issues, early and appropriate intervention works.  Delays in service provision have a very damaging effect on those experiencing mental health difficulties, their families, communities, schools and other State services.  Children with mental health difficulties cannot afford to wait.  Invariably, the longer the wait, the more entrenched the problem becomes.<\/p><p> Why is this happening?  First, there are acute recruitment challenges across a range of services, including the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, children's disability network teams, CDNTs, and Tusla.  The longer it takes to fully staff these services, the worse the outcomes for these vulnerable children will be.  This is urgent and the system needs to do better.   <\/p><p> Waiting lists are another issue.  Our understanding is that waiting lists for services such as CAMHS, which were already overstretched in 2020, have increased by almost half.  In fact, in our experience, a significant proportion of referrals to CAMHS do not even meet the criteria to be placed on a waiting list so many children are left with nothing.<\/p><p> In schools, there can be issues regarding what we call \"behaviours of concern\" in classrooms and school yards and these behaviours can be severe for the children in question and those around them.  Schools struggle to manage cases of extreme behaviour due in part to a lack of relevant training as well as capacity issues in the support services such as the National Behaviour Support Service, NBSS.  Managing the behaviour becomes the focus and the cause of the behaviour is not addressed as schools and parents do not have access to the professional supports or guidance needed for the child.  Early intervention is essential.  It is our assertion that the services provided under the Departments of Health and Education are completely separate, disjointed and without linkage between the services provided by either Department and with little or no communication about the children accessing the services.<\/p><p> The IPPN has made five recommendations, which are detailed in the submission.  Let us develop a culture of well-being, ensure seamless support from health and education, form teams of health and education professionals, provide appropriate and timely training and pilot approaches to support children's mental health.  The IPPN believes these recommendations would go a long way to addressing the current shortcomings and alleviate the suffering of children and we urge the committee to consider them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda McGorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the committee for the invitation to present.  I am the director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.  The NAPD is the professional association for post-primary school leaders in Ireland and provides a united voice for principals and deputy principals on issues of common concern across all three post-primary education sectors.  I will speak from a practical perspective to identify current practice and to outline some of the challenges facing schools as they endeavour to support students with mental health difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Outside of the family, post-primary schools play one of the most significant roles in the lives of young adults.  Schools recognise this and, as such, create the structures to support all students to try to help them to reach their full potential.  Schools acknowledge that their role is to meet the needs of their students academically, socially, holistically and pastorally.  This means that schools are recognising the person at the centre of the learning, which is the student, and the significance of the relationship between the student and the teacher in order to achieve successful outcomes in learning.  Students learn better in a positive and supportive environment and the creation of this positive learning environment is at the core of the culture in every school.<\/p> <p>  The majority of students will engage with their learning without any major or persistent issues.  However, an increasing number of students are encountering difficulties, which impacts on their ability to engage positively with their learning.  Schools recognise this and endeavour to respond to support their students.  Most schools have a student support team in operation.  This team involves all of the significant school personnel to support the student, for example, the principal and-or deputy, the career guidance counsellor, the year head, the special needs co-ordinator and other qualified and interested teachers.  The student support team will meet regularly and implement school-based interventions to support the engagement of the student with his or her learning in school.  There are, however, limits to what the student support team can do to support students.  Schools are only available to students during their opening hours from Monday to Friday and for 166 school days in the year.  In addition, it is particularly concerning if a student is not attending school, which is a common consequence for students who are impacted by mental health difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Students who are experiencing mental health difficulties and have withdrawn from attending school very often fall between the cracks.  It is fair to say that the majority of schools do not have access to a home school community liaison, HSCL, teacher and this presents particular difficulties for schools connecting with the home to positively collaborate in the best interest of the student.<\/p> <p>  Schools get significant support from NEPS and it is very interesting to hear from its director in her forward to the Department of Education publication, Student Supports in Post-Primary Schools, published in 2021.  In this document, she writes \"many factors that influence a young person&rsquo;s wellbeing are beyond the reach of schools\".  Schools acknowledge this and they continue to work to support their students in the best way they can.  She continues by stating that \"a strong support system in a school can be a vital first step in addressing difficulties, whether through providing inschool interventions and\/or through involving specialist services\".  Therein lies a significant issue for schools - linking with and working with the professional services in the best interest of the student.  Schools can only do so much and then require the support from professional services for the student.  Schools do not have the expertise, facilities and qualified staff to deliver mental health supports to their students.  Schools are not medical establishments, treatment centres or counselling clinics.  They are in fact schools whose primary responsibility is the delivery and support of learning.  <\/p> <p>  This does not, however, undermine the responsibility that schools have to support their students to engage them with their learning and schools generally do this well.  The NAPD would support a call for stronger links for schools with the professional mental health support services, the medical professionals and therapeutic services in a collaborative way to help students to participate fully in their learning and to reach their full potential in their school.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I reiterate a message in my written submission.  There is a need to expedite senior cycle reform to ensure it is more student-centred in its content delivery and assessment practices.  This must be coupled with a reimagined procedure for the selection of students for places in higher education.  The terminal assessment and the higher education selection process, in my opinion, are significant factors that contribute negatively to student mental health.  I thank the committee for listening and I am very happy to answer any questions that it may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Crone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  In the past number of years, we have become aware that mental health impacts have been significant in our adolescents.  Access to guidance counselling and pastoral care or student support teams within schools remains the first port of call for many of our young people.  In the absence of readily available mental health supports within the community or in clinical settings, schools act as a de facto emergency department for mental health and well-being difficulties.<\/p> <p>  The guidance allocation for schools is set out by the Department of Education.  The role of our guidance counsellors has changed and evolved enormously in the past decade.  With the introduction of the new junior cycle, the whole school guidance plan now covers just that - the whole school - in which the guidance allocation forms part of student support and is a pillar of well-being, both as a curricular item and as a tangible for our students&rsquo; lives.  That is a lot.  The ACCS would also note that our community and comprehensive schools with further education programmes do not get a career guidance teacher allocation for those programmes.<\/p><p>Providing schools in our sector with this allowance is essential if our learners are to benefit from the SOLAS national further education and training, FET, strategy.<\/p><p> Many mental health difficulties manifest in adolescence.  In addition, we can now see a measurable increase in mental health difficulties.  That increase is to crisis levels.  In our submission, we have cited a study that lays out \"a growing need to implement policies that will help children and adolescents cope with the short-term and long-term psychological effects of the pandemic\".  Schools see these issues every day, and every day we have to triage our time and attention based on what we know about those we already support educationally and pastorally and what we may need to do for the broken child in front of us now or for the terrified parent on the phone.<\/p><p> The physical activity and well-being study, PAWS, showed an increase in depressive symptoms across adolescents during school closures.  This is borne out in our schools too.  It is a significant challenge.  We are finding that, even outside the overwhelmed guidance counselling support we can offer and that can only be spread so thin, our special education teaching, SET, allocation remains stretched beyond breaking point by the surge in academic and well-being needs brought about by multiple school closures.<\/p><p> We look for help outside our walls, and we acknowledge the work of organisations and agencies that listen to us and try to help.  Formally, links between schools and NEPS continue to be good on an individual basis, but schools observe that the level of day-to-day support is compromised by the small number of referrals that schools can make to a psychologist in a given year.  The current focus of NEPS on emotionally based school avoidance is necessary and welcome and it is working, but the service's time is finite and its resources are meagre, which means that other areas are not being addressed at the level they were before 2020.<\/p><p> Links between the education sector and health services through local CDNTs are inconsistent and the provision of CAHMS remains different from region to region.  In both cases, staffing means that waiting lists vary but are always prohibitively long and students in senior years can age out of services before they reach the front of the queue.  It should never be the advice of any principal or education professional that bringing a self-harming child to an emergency department is the quickest way to access significant services.  On foot of these issues, the response of schools will continue to be individual and often based not necessarily on best practice, but on the practical availability of care for the students in our respective geographical areas.  A large amount still remains reliant on the relationships that school staff have with individuals in local services rather than on developed and established pathways.<\/p><p> Schools are fortunate.  Every year, we get an allocation of teachers based on our enrolment numbers and, in general, schools can appoint teachers to fill those posts.  We know how strongly that contrasts with therapist roles in the HSE across all geographical areas, which are both under-resourced and underfilled.  Unless and until mental health services are brought to a level that matches the increasing needs of our young people, schools will continue to bear the brunt of this.<\/p><p> When we train our new teachers, it could be that basic training in mental health would be of benefit to our students.  It makes sense for this training to be given through initial teacher education or through the Droichead qualification process.  Our teachers of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and our student support teams are conversant in this and have experience working with adolescents who might suffer from poor mental health.  It could be a good thing that all of our classroom teachers would know that this is something for them to understand and assist with, in the same way that education for students with additional needs has moved into the wheelhouse of the classroom teacher rather than just being the job of the support teacher.  However, in doing this, we might normalise the idea that schools are the place for this intervention.<\/p><p> Student voice initiatives in schools are important and can help the development of student-centred and student-led solutions, but we are the adults in the room and it is important that we deal with issues around poor mental health.  Schools cannot keep carrying this.  We do not have the professional expertise.  We are juggling with students' health and we are terrified of dropping a ball.  We do not have the time.  As long as we continue to act in place of proper services, students will continue to fall between the cracks and schools will continue to have to choose whether we support a child in mental health crisis at the cost of the child with a specific learning difficulty.  Some of these choices will have a cost.  In our submission, we have pointed to a need for policy, for pathways and for adequate people to be in place across services, of which education is just one.  We all need a co-ordinated approach to this if we are to help our children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Craig Petrie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in the discussion on this most important of topics.  My opening statement will be a summation of a more comprehensive submission that we have made to the committee.<\/p> <p>  No one in this room needs any lecture on the reality that there exist high levels of damage to young people's mental health due to the isolating and anxiety-inducing effects of the Covid-19 lockdowns and school closures, the impact of technologies on teenagers in particular, the relentless pace of change, and the shortage of community-based services and supports.  Recent reports of dramatic increases in cases of online bullying, the vast majority of which occur outside school settings, demand urgent action.  The social and emotional effects of these anxieties are reflected back into our schools through the attitudes and behaviours of students.  It must be accepted by policymakers that seeking to site both the problem and the solution solely at the door of our schools and colleges represents neither a realistic nor an honest solution to this challenge.<\/p> <p>  While the challenges and solutions are multifaceted, I wish in this brief statement to argue that one of the most effective and, indeed, cost-effective measures the State can provide is to bring our guidance counselling services up to a level where appropriate supports can be given exactly where and when our young people - 1 million of them - are to be found, that is, in our nation's schools.  The JMB's 2023 pre-budget submission is clear about the challenges facing our schools in terms of their guidance counselling provision.  The recent chief inspector's report makes repeated reference to the need for system-level supports to enhance provision for guidance and counselling in our schools, saying: \"Continued enhancement of system supports will be required in the area of Guidance and Counselling to address challenges related to recruitment, curriculum and increasing levels of anxiety among students\".  This call for enhancement of the service predates the announcements regarding senior cycle and the arrival of students from Ukraine.  As these emerging demands collide with the already inadequate allocation of hours for guidance counselling, which are not yet fully restored from before the financial crash cuts of over a decade ago, the capacity of schools to cope will be unsustainable and cases relating to young people in crisis will spill over into the already overwhelmed CAMHS.<\/p> <p>  Speaking of such services, one of the greatest challenges facing school management in making provision for students' mental health support is the discontinuity across the health and education systems in terms of access, availability, tracking and interagency communication.  While each service - NEPS, CAMHS, social workers, the HSE and the Garda - is working intensively to provide relevant and timely services, they all suffer not only from capacity challenges and long waiting lists, but also a lack of coherent provision from a school's perspective.  In this respect, the JMB recommends that the Government initiate a review of interagency co-operation, connectivity and communication with a view to supporting schools in their referrals of students in need of mental health supports and interventions.<\/p> <p>  At school and community service levels, the State must begin to recognise the need to invest in fit-for-purpose interventions to support young people professionally with psychological and psychiatric conditions, those facing LGBT-related mental health challenges, victims of cyberbullying, victims of racism and those engaged in drug abuse, and with tackling the damaging effects of economic disadvantage and social exclusion.<\/p> <p>  School principals need to be freed from excessive workloads so that they can properly attend to student well-being.  In this respect, the most effective solution lies in the allocation of additional deputy principals, DPs, across schools of all sizes and sectors.  I refer members to the JMB pre-budget submission where the case for additional DP allocation is set out.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its attention to this issue and we look forward to the report and recommendations that will emerge from this important conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>The NABMSE welcomes the opportunity to speak on this issue.  We represent the boards of management of special schools and mainstream schools with special classes.  Our schools work with and support students with special educational needs, SEN, from four years of age to 18 years of age with mild, moderate, severe and profound disabilities, with autism, with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, SEBD, and also with complex medical needs.  Meaningful access to education and the physical and emotional well-being of our students are always central considerations of our boards of management.<\/p> <p>  The NABMSE considers that school mental health services are wholly inadequate at post-primary level where students consistently need to be referred to outside agencies for support, where they remain on lengthy waiting lists, even when in crisis.<\/p><p>This happens because the availability and allocation of qualified counsellors to schools is utterly inadequate given the rise in levels of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide ideation, eating disorders, body dysphoria, gender dysphoria and so on among teenagers today.  These are significant issues that, if not addressed early and appropriately, will lead to lifelong difficulties for each of these individuals.<\/p><p> There is no access to mental health services at primary level or in the special educational context.  Even in a crisis situation, for example, where students talking about suicide and self-harming, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is unable to provide any form of concrete support.  Why do we not have suitably qualified child counsellors in primary schools and special schools as members of school staff?  Many children&rsquo;s difficulties could then be identified and that child could be given early support, thus cutting down on more urgent need for intervention when things have significantly deteriorated for that child.  Sadly, when a critical incident occurs in a school in Ireland, NEPS is only allowed to provide support to the teachers at that school.  Its intervention is designed to assist teachers in counselling and supporting the other children in a school, for example, where their friend has died.  In a special school, staff include teachers, SNAs, care workers, nurses, part-time teachers and bus escorts.   All these staff develop friendships with the pupils and often becoming the first confidante when concerns or difficulties arise.<\/p><p> In the case of a critical incident, for example, when a child who attends a special school passes away, which happens often in schools where students have complex medical needs, the other pupils and parents understandably become frightened and disorientated.  Their lives are shaken by the enormity of death.  For children, the concept of death - the \"never again\" - is difficult to comprehend.  SNAs, bus escorts and all the other support staff are not provided with training by the Departments of Education or Health.  The role of trainer and identification of training needs is left to the board of management, principal and teachers in an individual school.<\/p><p> NABMSE, calls for an immediate review of the critical incident policy in schools in Ireland.  This review must examine how counsellors can be deployed to special schools in emergencies.  We need counsellors with specialised training who can work with children, develop staff skills and assist parents with coping mechanisms.  We need to provide direct training to all the support staff surrounding children in special schools.<\/p><p> School attendance is an important contributor to the well-being and general mental wellness of our students.  A small percentage of pupils with special educational needs disengage from school for a variety of reasons and others miss substantial time in school due to prolonged illnesses and hospitalisation.  These pupils need to know there is a future for them in further and higher education.  Supports must be put in place early enough to prevent this drop-out or disengagement, which prevents these students with additional needs from ever having the opportunity to engage with further education or training.<\/p><p> NABMSE also suggests the need to appoint special school liaison teachers who can support families who are often under extreme pressure coping with a child with complex needs.  This teacher would support the children and families in liaising with other agencies, and the positive link with the school could help maintain their child&rsquo;s attendance, positive engagement and achievement in school.  In NABMSE&rsquo;s opinion, the concept of lifelong learning needs to be resourced as early as possible for all pupils presenting with special educational needs in our system.<\/p><p> Our members' board of management reports that it is difficult to co-ordinate services with the HSE and Department of Education, despite the fact there are established and historical links between them.  We understand that pilot programmes are a way of examining how links can be strengthened.  We are, however, concerned that many pupils in our schools across the country suffer silently without support as they have no interventions for as long as pilot studies takes place elsewhere.  We call for an immediate review of all existing pilot programmes with a view to extending interventions and supports to all pupils with special educational needs.  A strong, consistent, accessible multidisciplinary approach has been severely lacking to date.<\/p><p> As I said, a small group of children with additional and special needs disengage from school for a number of reasons.  These can be health, family issues, cultural misunderstanding on the part of the school and staff and mental health issues.  We suggest a special school liaison teacher in every special school, continued support for distance learning and the provision of targeted learning to students who cannot attend due to illness, vulnerability, school refusal and mental health issues.  We also call for cultural awareness training for all our staff in our schools as there is a need for emphasis on knowledge, acceptance and celebration of different cultures and blending these cultures into our everyday learning.<\/p><p> We also need to ensure that students work with other students and look at how groups are formed.  We must develop flexibilities so that students are involved in a wide range of activities and, therefore, in more peer groups.

ETBs are currently patrons of 27 community national schools alongside being patrons of schools that cater for one third of all second-level schools, which is 100,000 students in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We work in primary, post-primary and tertiary education.  Those schools are welcoming, cater for learners from diverse backgrounds, are learner-centred and attempt to be holistic in everything they do.  We try to support students not just academically but on a range of issues that present, one in particular being mental health issues in the past few years.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has definitely added to that issue although before that, we were severely challenged.  Early intervention is key in preventing children from developing more complex mental health issues later in life.  When schools are adequately resourced, they can play a vital role in the promotion of positive mental health.  We have to recognise that at primary level, however, there are no formal access routes to in-school counselling services and there are no formal structures in all primary schools for supporting students' mental health.  We call for the establishment of student support teams in primary schools to be fully supported.  This could be achieved through a consultation process with the relevant bodies at primary level.<\/p> <p>  At post-primary level, we are very lucky to have the guidance counsellors who all work hard in this area.  However, we need extended training in more therapeutic counselling rather than career guidance.  Many schools at both primary and post-primary level have significant difficulties accessing supports for students with serious mental health issues.  We heard from other contributors today on the increase in waiting lists to services such as child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Ultimately, however, many of these issues fall to the school to address.  No matter what the level of resources or expertise, parents call on schools first.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, ETBI is of the view that a child-centred approach to mental health services is needed yet currently, various mental health services are working in isolation or in silos.  We have a recent example in County Kerry where a number of agencies including NEPS, the counselling services and Jigsaw came together along with the schools.  They have been brought together to provide training to the student support teams in our post-primary schools in the county.  This multidisciplinary approach to training, which was led by NEPS, has led to significant improvements in the ways that student support teams in the county operate.  We call for this to be looked at and extended.<\/p> <p>  We also have the challenge of school leaders not being fully sure on who to bring in to support students.  It is the view of ETBI that mental health initiatives should seek approval from a national body such as the Department of Education or NEPS with clear criteria in order that schools can be confident the initiatives and the people they are bringing in are backed and authorised.<\/p> <p>  ETBs have a proud history of running professional learning networks, PLN.  Teachers and school leaders come together to learn from the best and bring that back to the schools to extend out that learning.  We ask and request that these PLNs be extended into the area of mental health.  Teachers would need to be released to attend the PLNs and paid substitution would be needed for that.  We also see NEPS having a role in providing these PLNs as the resident expert in this area.<\/p> <p>  We echo the call from previous speakers regarding initial teacher education, and mental health should be part of that.<\/p><p>However we also believe that all teachers need to be adequately trained on an ongoing basis to enable them to identify students and families who are struggling in terms of mental health and to provide the most appropriate ways to support them.<\/p><p> What ETBI is calling for is the establishment of student support teams at primary level and the backing of them at post-primary level, which would include an interdisciplinary approach to training those student support teams.  We ask for the establishment of those professional learning networks to ensure that mental health is at the forefront and that this would be supported by NEPS.  We ask that we develop an accredited mental health initiative which is overseen by either the Department or NEPS.  We ask for increased investment in NEPS to allow for further training of school staff and the expansion into counselling services.  We also ask for further exploration into establishing the school-based mental health support teams, which this committee has already started to look at.<\/p><p> As a former principal who has only been out of the position 14 months, I know the role that schools can play, which we have heard about today.  The key thing for me is that schools are nearly always the first stop for parents when they have an issue with mental health.  They go to schools, which do their best to support that.  However, we need further training and resources in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark McDonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe uilig.  I thank the witnesses for their important presentations on this issue of great concern.  It is fair to say that the call for resources would be a significant common denominator in all their presentations.  I am sure they would have support from everybody in this room on that.  I will throw a few hot potatoes of varying levels of heat at the witnesses.  There are some issues I am thinking about and some questions I have.  While I support all the calls for resources, I worry that if we only talk about resources there is a danger we will never have enough resources because we will be subject to the ups and downs in the economy and so on.  That is all the more reason that we are able to ask ourselves if there are ways in which the system is failing and if things could be changed that might enhance those resources or prevent the need for them.  For example, I mention the graduate exodus.  Is it a part of the problem that we are not able to get the people we need?  Do we need to think brave thoughts about reserving places for people who commit to staying in the country after they qualify, for example, in the context of the repayment of fees in the future?  Perhaps there could be some way that a debt could be incurred if they do not stay because it seems to me that the brain drain is part of the story.<\/p><p>I will turn to issues relating to how the system works.  There is an understandable tendency to think in terms of having resources in schools, but that is probably predicated on schools being larger in size.  I question whether that could be a problem.  I mention the concept of Dunbar's number, namely,that people can only relate to 150 other people.  That is an idea that is out there.  Should we be concerned about schools being too big?  Could that be a negative contributor to student mental health?<\/p><p>In recent days, I was struck by all the talk of the great role that the chaplaincy and spiritual support played in Donegal in the context of the terrible tragedy there.  I am sure the witnesses will have seen various articles on that by various commentators.  In addition to talking about the important role of guidance counsellors should we be saying more about chaplains?  I often think of Victor Frankl's book <i>Man's Search for Meaning<\/i>and Nietzsche&rsquo;s quote: &quot;He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.&quot;  The Education Act 1998 talks about physical, moral, spiritual and social education.  The SPHE consultation document is much more stripped down and talks about physical and emotional education.  I wonder if we are missing something in the system and if we are, I wonder if we are brave enough to talk about that.  My impression is that what is proposed in SPHE is fairly stripped down and does not talk about much to do with friendship, nor does it mention bereavement at all.  I was interested in what Ms O'Rourke had to say on that subject.  Do we need to start asking questions about the things we discuss and the things we do not discuss?<\/p><p>I was glad to hear what Mr. Crone had to say about the points system.  The tail of the high points courses is wagging the dog of the whole system.  We have discussed this in this committee before but I refer to preventing student anxiety and mental health problems at whatever level of the scale they are experienced and we have to say that the CAO and the colleges have a responsibility here.  Those are my various potatoes and I would be glad to hear what the witnesses have to say on any or all of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#F00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>The Senator made some interesting points.  The issue of the graduate exodus troubles us because on one level we are looking for extra provision in the arena of guidance counselling but we know we have a teacher shortage as well so where will we get these guidance counsellors?  It can be planned.  We know the surge in pupil numbers in post-primary education will peak in 2023, so we would imagine that perhaps we should be planning now for the fact that we will have extra teachers on board at that stage.  The graduate exodus is perplexing because we do not know where all the teachers are going.  If you look at the figures we have from the Teaching Council for registered practitioners, there are many more teachers on the books than we have in play.  This year it has not been as acute as it might have been last year, but we need to do a little bit of thinking on where we might get the extra guidance counsellors from.  We would say that some of the training courses we have need to be augmented and we would say the financial assistance for teachers who might want to engage in guidance counselling courses should be put in place.  We would have some solutions that we would be able to suggest in that arena but it is an issue for us.  Even in preparing the submission, the duality we came across was that in talking to the Department, we acknowledged that there is a teacher shortage.  If we bring down the pupil-teacher ratio at this stage in post-primary schools it will cause us difficulties.  We should be planning forward two or three years.  If the Senator looks at our pre-budget submission he will see what our thinking in that arena is.<\/p> <p>  Schools do not necessarily need to be bigger in the context of giving schools the provision to help students in this sphere.  We made the point on extra help for schools around deputy principal provision.  If the school leader can be freed up as much as possible from some of the administrative duties that the principal will have, the care will trickle down and the principal will be able to spend more time looking after the students in his or her care.  Some kind of change and help for principals around deputy principal provision is hugely important.  When you talk about chaplaincy you are making a point and we have made that point to the Department in a number of engagements.  Schools in our sector do not have chaplains and it would be a fantastic addition to the school system if we could enhance that provision and give it to schools that do not have it.  There would be great value in that.<\/p> <p>  The SPHE programme will be augmented as we move through it.  The training that will be given to teachers in the SPHE space will allow them to deal with issues such as relationships in a fundamental way.  I am very hopeful that the new SPHE guidelines will help us in this regard.  On the senior cycle, we all hope that the demands on our students might change over the years.  A great deal of work is needed in that space in the coming years but we are all of the view that we need to bring in senior cycle reform to help the mental well-being of our students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which all basically say the same thing.

Where it breaks down from the school's perspective is that the information does not come back as to what the recommendations are to support it.  When a diagnosis is being looked for, schools readily have that information and provide it, but there is no mechanism in place for that to come back.  No therapeutic supports are available to support schools and that is a call all of us have been making for many years, particularly in regard to the new interventions, the junior cycle, well-being and so on.<\/p> <p>  The question is whether the therapeutic supports should be hosted in schools and that is a debate that needs to be had.

The information is not coming back down to schools.  Once there is a diagnosis letter, the supports are not there to help the student engage with the learning.

That has changed, and those referrals now have to be made through the GP rather than the school.  The nature of how referrals are made has moved such that they are parent and family centred rather than school centred.  This means it is the parents' responsibility to make the referral, but that assumes parents are agentic and in control and can manoeuvre the web of waiting lists that is out there.  Parents will then ask us whether we can intervene on their behalf, so we need to get written consent from parents for every service under the GDPR and all the other barriers that are put in our way.  There was a time when I could ask for a case conference in respect of a child, where the child was at the centre of the table, and I would speak figuratively before the meeting about the child being at the centre of the table, where I could draw in those services.  That has been diluted to the point where it just does not exist anymore, and that is down to staffing levels and to the cuts that were introduced ten years ago not having been reinstated.  The service has been absolutely skeletised.  We have talked about balkanisation, the need for integration and joined-up thinking and silos.  We have an amazing vocabulary but we have not made the connections we need to make.  I work in a children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s services committee, CYPSC, the young people services committees that try to bring together the health and education services, such as Tusla, CAMHS and primary care.

I am working on a pilot project in my area, in Dublin 15, to see whether we can get back to doing what we used to do, namely, family-based services.

It struck me that they are calling for teacher training in the area of mental health services, which demonstrates that this is not just about looking for more resources.  It is about a whole-of-education-system approach, so it is reasonable to say we need more resources as well as believing that all teachers should have training.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Petrie stated that the school is the first port of call.

Not only must we look at mental health services but we must also focus on the difficulties faced in modern life by young people and how we address that in schools, particularly around tolerance.  In some schools I have come across, there is a difficulty with hearing all voices and respecting everyone's opinion.  When that opinion is damaging to another person and the expression of that opinion undermines another person's rights, teachers can feel trapped between two constitutional rights, in some ways.  What can we do before the mental health services get involved?  Are there other things we can do to support teachers in addressing those conflicts, for want of a better word, between students that lead to mental health problems?

The document, Looking at Our School, which is a blueprint for best practice in schools, was reviewed this year.  Its initial iteration was in 2016.  Well-being is mentioned 28 times in the document.  We have moved from talking about student voice to student participation.  A lot of good work is taking place in the school communities to try to address some of these issues.  I would like to think that schools are increasingly becoming kinder places because of these kinds of interventions.  We need to that ongoing work at school level to be matched with resources.

We know from dealing with social workers and staff in CAMHS that they are, like us, overstretched.  There is no magic solution for this.  We just have to work through it systemically.

I take the point that a chaplain can be enormously supportive resource in a school.  However, many of our schools do not serve Catholic populations.  We have a wide range of Educate Together schools, community and national schools and non-designated schools in the ETB system.  I do not mind what an extra support person is called in the school but if we are to be truly inclusive, we need counsellors who are trained to support a wide range of students.  We should perhaps widen our thinking a little.  Do we need to take a teacher out of a school in order that he or she can return as a guidance counsellor or counsellor?  Can we train counsellors who are not necessarily teachers to go directly into schools?  I know staffing is a huge issue at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Another point that was raised, one to which I referred in my opening statement, was cultural awareness training.  If our schools are to be meaningfully inclusive in the way they operate, we need to address a lot of issues.  Professor Dympna Devine published a study not long ago which showed that over 95% of our teachers are white and Eurocentric in their views.  We have black children and children who are gay or may have a disability who can go through the entire system and never see themselves positively reflected anywhere.  I am doing a small study at the moment.  Students, while they acknowledge black history month and cultural awareness week, say that when they return to the classroom where the important stuff happens the curriculum is white, fully-abled and straight.  There are very practical things we can do around that to help people feel less othered, more included and positively reflected in our system.

We have given some examples from the ETBI submission, which has been echoed elsewhere, about initial teacher education.  That needs to be looked at but there is also the ongoing training of staff.  That is very resource light but its impact can be huge.  We spoke about the PLNs where one person is trained in bringing that network back to the staff.

I know all involved are doing their best to try to grapple with where we are.  There is no doubt that pupils are experiencing emotional distress, trauma and bereavement, as was highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is fair to say that there is no one size to fit every situation.  We need supports in place for students and teachers.  There is no doubt we also need to look after the mental health of teachers.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge that there has been a shift.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, sought and received funding of &euro;5 million for a pilot scheme for a programme of counselling supports for children.  That is ground-breaking in the development of school counselling.  Those supports offer an opportunity for early intervention, which is of great importance.  More important, this also brings recognition that mental health in schools is an educational issue.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McGorman stated that in his experience education has not come to the table.  That concerns me and it is important that we try to do something about it because the particular link that was made indicated a divergence from the opinion that this is a health issue and not an educational one.  I hope that will herald change.  I acknowledge Se&aacute;na Brady who did a of work in my party on that issue.<\/p> <p>  We should have preventative measures in place to ensure positive mental health as opposed to dealing with crises when they arrive.  I have some experience of restorative justice.  My understanding had been that this was a process that teachers and principals could bring in to schools when negative behaviour arose and that it could provide support in that way.  It was a very good system.  I was in a school recently in Newbridge where the teacher uses different forms of this throughout a school lesson and I was greatly impressed.  This was to check in where students were and they could give a number.  I am sure many of the witnesses are familiar with this.  It was excellent and gave every pupil an opportunity to be heard with respect to where he or she was at that particular time point in time.  I ask the witnesses to respond on that.<\/p> <p>  I agree that the whole-school, community-based approach is important, with stakeholders coming together.  I am from Rathangan, which is a small town, and we had a very difficult situation approximately 12 years ago, which I will not go into now.  We had a fantastic response from all the State services.  They came together and formed a circle with the school and community.  It very much worked in preventing further suicides and trying to ensure the young people felt heard, whether they needed to have positive mental health examples in their life or were in crisis themselves.  I agree with the importance of home school liaison teachers and I am conscious of schools that do not have such a teacher.  I completely agree with NABMSE on having a special school liaison teacher appointed to support families.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to comment, including on preventative measures and supporting positive mental health if they so wish.

It is interesting that even in the Houses of the Oireachtas this morning, three different committees met to discuss more or less the same issue.<\/p> <p>  As a former primary school teacher, I share some of the frustration I have heard from members that teachers are often the last to hear and the last to be listened to, despite the fact that they spend 25 or more hours a week in the company of these children and often, apart from their parents, are the people who know these children best.  Yet there does not seem to be a way to make those teaching professionals heard in respect of provision of mental health services, and that is a huge opportunity missed.<\/p> <p>  The thing that jumped out at me from the IPPN presentation was that we should have teams of education and health professionals to work with school clusters and individual schools to support children directly in the schools where they learn.  To give a concrete, real-world example of that, I know of an inner-city Waterford school where there are three different CDNTs represented within that school community.  One of them is based out of Dungarvan for those in Waterford west, so some of the children there are supposed to access their services in Dungarvan.  That is an hour from the school each way, plus the appointment time.  That is a full day for the parents.  For God's sake.  The school is open to this and has talked to me about it.  Why on earth would we not host the services in the school building?  I know that creates the issue of competency and who is in charge of that, and there is already a heavy load on school principals without having to become health professionals as well as everything else they are supposed to do, but there are opportunities there as well.<\/p> <p>  I think Mr. Crone said that schools are really good at supporting the many and that it is the few we need the specific help with.  Mr. McGorman said we see the role tapered.  That really is the case.  We have a huge resource in respect of our teaching profession, notwithstanding that we are losing teachers and they are going abroad or moving to other areas.  One of the strengths of education in Ireland, however, is that we have continued to attract really good candidates into the profession and that our education system is built on the quality of the teachers we have rather than other things.  We are making progress on the pupil-teacher ratio and issues like that, but the fact that we have good-quality people in the sector is the foundation stone of our education system.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to career progression and allowing and enabling people to move into something like educational psychology or provision of other services.  Other than that, when someone enters a teaching career, he or she will either do 40 years in the classroom or take a principalship.  Many teachers I know are not interested in a principalship because those who take them stop teaching.  For a walking principle, that is the end of it.  The day teachers enter a principalship, they become administrators and can forget about teaching.  They will occasionally get to interact with classes, but most of the time they are giving out to bold people, which is probably not why they got into teaching in the first place.  We have a huge resource there and people who need other progression pathways.  It seems clear as day to me that we should be pointing them in directions where they can support, interact with and teach children in a different way in our school systems.<\/p> <p>  As for educational psychologists, it would be such a huge resource, even while people are training, if they could provide, for want of a better word, that triage service of looking at people's needs and just making sense of them.  Then, by the time the children are sitting in front of the educational psychologist, they are making best use of that time and not engaging in form-filling.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if anything I have said has amounted to a question in terms of punctuation marks.  I do not know if I quite got to a question mark at the end of that.  It was mainly observations.  Perhaps the witnesses feel that some of them merit comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#L00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>If I may, I will kick the ball initially.  As for the CDNTs, it is exactly as the Deputy said.  That is a massive frustration for us.  If I may give an example, we have one special school in our area, Dublin 15, that has five CDNTs working with it, so I can talk about one child with speech and language difficulties but not another child.  The other child does not have a speech and language therapist in his service, and there is one principal dealing with all of five different services.  We said at the start, when CDNTs were being reconfigured, that this was the wrong way to do it.  We are proactively working on that.  We have convinced the HSE to come on board and put in place one service for the school in question, see how it works and put all the resources into that in one case.  Then, if we can show that it works successfully there, let us move it out beyond that.<\/p> <p>  As for the notion of teacher career progression, we have to grow up about this.  We have to be mature about it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has hit the nail on the head in respect of teacher progression.  Not everybody wants to be sitting in sixth, fifth, fourth or third class for 40 years.  We have different routes.  It is a question of having that talent and availability there and the need to match them up.  There is also the idea of getting people in training - and we have said this to speech and language therapists as well as psychologists in training - out and working in schools to assist and to do some of the lifting along the way.  That that would be really welcome as well.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator O'Loughlin, I emphasise again the huge amount of work going on in schools.  The Senator is absolutely right.  I had in my school a tragedy when we had five deaths in one year, one by suicide.  Every single time people looked to the school community for leadership.  Every single time they asked, \"Where is the principal in this?\" and \"What can we bring to the table?\"  Schools are more than willing to bring that expertise, compassion and, dare I say it, love with them, but when we put our hands out for the supports, that is when the support has been found lacking.<\/p> <p>  I hope that answers some of the issues Senator O'Loughlin and Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda McGorman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>If I may, the issue of fluidity is very important because what we find in our schools is that oftentimes the principals are the leaders in the school.

The new assumption, especially under the HSE model, is that the parents are agents who are able to command all the services are their child and draw the services in.  That is not the reality and parents experience massive difficulties in trying to negotiate their way around these services.  It is similar for GPs.  For me to talk to the GP of a child, I have to get the signed consent from the parent and email it to the receptionist to pass on the GP before the GP will take a phone call from me.

That means they are open to a toxic and destructive habit, which brings them down rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, items on the dark web, all sorts of websites encouraging eating disorders and very harmful and destructive behaviours.  That, combined with Covid-19, means there is a crisis brewing in our primary schools.<\/p> <p>  In special education, one of the two practical solutions we could put in place very quickly is administrative deputy principals for special schools.  Our special schools do not really meet the numbers border for any of the general allocations given out to mainstream primary schools.  This is because in special schools, it is about need rather than numbers.  The other thing that would be incredibly helpful to special is the reintroduction of something along the lines of class hours.  That was incredibly beneficial because of the flexibility built into it.  We do not have substitution now for the first day of absenteeism, which is enormously problematic in special education where you cannot divide classes out among other teachers.  It was mentioned earlier that we know who the caring person is in our schools and who can be there when a child needs someone that minute, when they are incredibly anxious or they are having a crisis or an anxiety or panic attack or whatever it is.  You need the flexibility to have somebody there at that moment.  Something along the lines of the class hours would give schools that flexibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I could write books on mobile phones; I have children myself.  Mr. McGorman, you spoke about the supports in primary schools compared to secondary.  That is something I have raised with the Minister here on numerous occasions.  I will give the example of the primary school where my own children go, St. Aidan's Primary School in Enniscorthy, where there are up to 1,000 pupils.  They have a principal and the vice principals are kind of teaching; there is no walking vice principal in that size of a school.  When you go to a secondary school, where there could be 350 students, there is a principal and a walking vice principal.  What is needed to get the larger primary schools the same services as the secondary schools?  I mean no disrespect to the secondary schools, they need them and deserve them, but so do primary schools.  As you said, specifically in the senior cycle in primary schools, they are now having similar issues and problems that secondary schools had a number of years ago, in that children are now having anxiety problems and are facing issues in life, whether it involves mobile phones or whatever.  They are having these problems at a younger age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#N01200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the question.  It is a real question for us as school leaders at primary level.  There are two priorities for school leaders at primary level, from a leadership development point of view.  The point about the role of the teaching principal has to made as well.  Up to 40% of our schools have teaching principals, meaning that the principal in those schools has teaching duties, as well as the deputy principal.  It would be remiss of me to address this issue without addressing that as well.  It is not just large schools that need the support of an administrative deputy principal.  If you are a teaching principal in-role as a teacher, you have all of the responsibilities is that have been laid out here as well.  Chaos and stress do not choose when they arrive on a particular day.  All human life is represented in our schools.  Our teaching principals are right at the coalface concerning this issue.<\/p> <p>  On administrative status for deputy principals, again, our post-primary cousins have been very successful in raising that and having that addressed as an issue.  We have had to balance between a call for administrative deputy principals and support for our teaching principals, who get one administrative day a week now.  That is something for which we were fighting for years.  As a result of the pandemic, it was given and we have retained it.  However, that does not diminish the call for administrative deputy principals.  If we were to ask the why of it here at this committee, it is about supporting the co-ordination of special education needs because it has become so complex at primary level.  It has become the catch-all for everything.  Special education needs has been used to cover every single thing we have talked about here, as well as the cognitive developmental issues that children have in mainstream education and their educational needs.  If we were to make a recommendation around this, it would be to support the co-ordination of special education needs.  That would be one massive area which could encompass or include or allow for the management of special education needs as part of the role of an administrative deputy principal.<\/p> <p>  It is down to economics, resources and priorities at the end of the day.  The Department will consider an administrative deputy principal in very large schools, but we would be anxious for that to be pulled down.  If there are schools where there are more than two special classes or a class for children with autism, those schools also get administrative deputy principals.  The principle has been conceded and it is down to budget and priorities, ultimately, as to how it is allocated on a year-to-year basis.  Certainly, every year the IPPN makes submissions as part of the budgetary submission in relation to our teaching principals and administrative status for larger schools as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda McGorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Take the example of St. Aidan's primary school in Enniscorthy.

If that was a company, it would have two or three bosses at the top, whereas it does not have that with 1,000 pupils.<\/p><p>It is absolutely mad that this has not been addressed.  There is a huge expectation on principals and vice principals.  There is more responsibility being heaped on them, not on a weekly, but almost on a daily basis.  There are more expectations from parents regarding the way children are taught and that goes back to the principal as well.  This is something that the Department of Education has to address quickly.  Unfortunately, it has fallen on deaf ears when I have raised it here for the last two and a half years.  Covid has really highlighted the issue.  I have nothing against post-primary.

School principals and deputy principals are only allocated on the number of whole-time teaching positions.  It is completely blind to all the other work that schools have to do.  A special school could have a staff of 40 SNAs and 50 bus escorts and all of this has to be managed.  No recognition is given, either in the staffing allocation or, indeed, in pay.  The pay scale of principals in these schools does not reflect the number of staff on roll; it just reflects the number of mainstream teachers.  This is always very low because the number of pupils in these schools is low but the staff need is massively high.  That has not been recognised by the system and it is a massive issue.

It is a very important issue.  It is only really coming into play in the last ten years during which time the number of SNAs in schools has increased.  The extra staffing that principals have to manage is not reflected in any way, shape or form in the context of allocation to the schools or the salary earned by a principal.  This is something that will have to be looked at.  Fundamentally, what has been said about deputy principals is correct.  In our submission, we made three fundamental points.  One was around provision of guidance counsellors, one was around inter-agency co-operation and the final one around trying to give time to principals, as leaders in the school, to deal with the problem kids and the students in their care.  Any way we can augment the provision of deputy principalships in our schools, we think that is huge.<\/p> <p>  We are very concerned about burnout among principals at the moment.  During Covid things settled a little at school level because things quietened down to some extent but we are becoming more concerned now that there is burnout.  Principals put up with a lot during Covid, they did an awful lot and they gave a lot of themselves.  We think the best supports for schools come in at the deputy principal level, whether at primary level or post primary level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I have three examples in Wexford where the principals retired and I was sure the deputy principals would take up the positions.
