I am seeking the approval of the committee for the Supplementary Estimate allocating a total of &euro;1.362 billion to provide the necessary additional funding of &euro;1.212 billion to subhead B11, electricity credit, and &euro;150 million to subhead B13, emergency generation capacity, both of which are in the energy transformation programme.  I am also requesting approval to reallocate &euro;7 million as follows: &euro;6 million for subhead A7, climate initiatives; and &euro;1 million for subhead B6, other energy programmes, national and international.<\/p><p>This reallocation is possible due to savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership area under subhead A4, environmental and climate research, where savings of &euro;2.5 million have been identified; subhead A5, carbon fund, where savings of &euro;3.5 million have been identified; and subhead C3, mining and petroleum services, where savings of &euro;1 million have been identified.<\/p><p> The Government took steps earlier this year to help alleviate the burden on households of the rapidly increasing energy costs when we provided for a credit of &euro;200, including VAT, to be applied to domestic customers' energy bills under the first electricity costs emergency benefits scheme.  However, electricity and gas prices have continued to rise due to international conditions, in particular the current challenges arising from the crisis in Ukraine, and indications are that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p> The Government has taken action in budget 2023 to provide further assistance to those who are most vulnerable to the effects of the cost-of-living crisis.  A wide range of measures were introduced, including a &euro;600 electricity credit to be applied in three instalments between November 2022 and April 2023.  Additional social welfare payments totalling &euro;1.2 billion across a number of benefits and schemes will support in the region of 1.5 million people over the coming winter period.  Further measures introduced by the Government involved significant support for commuters and students.  The reduced public transport fares announced previously are to be extended to the end of 2023 and a number of measures have been put in place to help eligible students with academic fees.<\/p><p> In light of the continued increase in household energy bills, the Government has decided to support domestic customers further through a second electricity benefit scheme for this winter.  The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Act 2022 provided for the electricity credit to be made under the scheme on a once-off basis in 2022.  Therefore, new legislation was required for this scheme to be established.  The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, which provides the legal basis for the new scheme, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 13 October and was signed by the President into law.  The new scheme will be closely modelled on the previous one and an electricity costs emergency benefit payment of &euro;200, including VAT, for an estimated 2.2 million domestic accounts is to be paid in each of the November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023 electricity billing cycles, totalling &euro;600, including VAT, per domestic electricity account.  This scheme will have a ceiling of &euro;1.211 billion and within this, a contingency has been included to ensure there is no shortfall to cover the increase in any new domestic customers during the period of the scheme.  The scheme will be operated by ESB Networks which will make payments to the individual energy supplies.  Those suppliers will, in turn, credit individual domestic electricity accounts.  The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will be charged with oversight of the scheme.<\/p><p> A further &euro;1 million will be allocated for those domestic customers whose households many not have an individual meter point reference number, MPRN.  Upon completion of the previous electricity credit scheme, the need to have an MPRN resulted in certain cohorts not being able to access the payment.  A particular cohort since identified includes some Traveller families in certain local authority accommodations where the MPRN is registered to the local authority and supplies multiple households.  Work is under way to establish an alternative mechanism to ensure the payment reaches these Traveller families.<\/p><p> VAT must be applied on the electricity bill balance after the credit has been applied.  On that basis, the credit of &euro;183.49 is being applied exclusive of VAT on each account.  Inclusive of VAT, the total reduction on each household electricity bill will be &euro;200.<\/p><p> Earlier this year, the CRU directed EirGrid, the transmission system operator, to procure some 450 MW of additional temporary generation capacity for winter 2023-24 through to winter 2025-26 to offset a potential capacity shortfall of electricity supply.  The temporary generation capacity may be extended to winter 2026-27, if necessary.  To comply with this direction, EirGrid requires financial support from the Exchequer.  Legislation to ensure EirGrid can carry out this direction, including the legal basis for my Department providing the necessary financial support, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas in July of this year and was signed into law by the President.<\/p><p> The level of financial support required in 2022 to allow EirGrid place orders on the electricity generation units and to ensure they are delivered and installed in time for winter 2023-24 was estimated at &euro;350 million.  As the final level of financial support required in 2022 was not known earlier this year as the contractual arrangements were still at an early stage at that time, it was agreed that approval of the allocation of funding for the emergency generation capacity would be requested in two tranches.  A previous allocation request of &euro;200 million was granted in July with the indicative funding request for the initial stages of the project, with a further request forecasted to be required in the autumn of &euro;150 million when the contractual details were close to finalisation.  These contracts are now ready to be finalised subject to final terms being agreed and the balance of funding being available.  The &euro;150 million balance of funding represents the final agreed figures required by EirGrid for the purchase of the generation equipment and balance of the plant this year.<\/p><p> The total cost of the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme is, as I said, estimated at &euro;1.212 billion and the balance of funding for the emergency power generation scheme is &euro;150 million.  As the additional funding of &euro;1.362 billion required is being provided from the Exchequer, the main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to allocate &euro;1.212 billion to subhead B11 and &euro;150 million to subhead B13 in the energy transformation programme area to fund the two measures.<\/p><p> In addition to the approval for the Exchequer funding for the two schemes, I am also seeking approval to reallocate &euro;7 million within subheads in my Vote to provide for expenditure for a number of other measures.<\/p><p> Local authorities have a particularly important role in the delivery of both climate mitigation and adaptation.  This is reflected in the provisions of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, which requires each local authority to prepare a local authority climate action plan, specifying the mitigation and the adaptation measures to be adopted by the local authority.  These plans will be updated once every five years.  The first of these plans is due to be submitted by each local authority by the end of 2023.  This funding will allow the Department to establish a governance structure with local authorities for the development and reporting of these climate actions plans.  I am seeking approval to provide funding of &euro;3.5 million in 2022 through the allocation of savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership programme area.<\/p><p> My Department has secured support from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, for a climate-specific round of the sound and vision scheme to address the need to fund programming specific to the climate crisis.  This programming will contribute to an important component of delivering on the national dialogue&rsquo;s objective of improving climate literacy.  Improving climate literacy will enhance the capacity of people to make small changes in their daily lives, engage with climate action at a local level in their communities and at national level in the co-design of policy.  Through the expertise of the BAI and the vision of Ireland&rsquo;s programme makers, we will ensure the delivery of a range of innovative and creative programming to bring climate awareness, literacy and empowerment into homes across the country.  To facilitate this, I am seeking approval to provide funding of &euro;2.5 million in 2022 through allocating savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership programme area.<\/p><p> The national energy security framework published earlier this year places a significant emphasis on the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy to underpin Ireland's security of supply.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the planning system is fully supportive of the roll-out of renewables, something first expressed in action No. 102 of the climate action plan 2021.<\/p><p> As part of its ongoing effort to improve the delivery of its service, An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently provided the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with a specific resource plan for the area of maritime development and climate action, including the establishment of the marine and climate directorate.  The total funding requirement for the establishment of the new functions is expected to be in the region of &euro;3.5 million and my Department is committing to provide &euro;1 million in once-off funding in 2022 to support the set-up of this function.  I am seeking approval to provide this contribution under subhead B6, other energy programmes (national and international), in 2022 through allocating savings identified in subhead C3, mining and petroleum services.<\/p><p> I am happy to take questions from the committee on any aspect of this Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#A00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

We will go back for second and third rounds as necessary.<\/p><p> I refer to the funding for local authorities and the public bodies carrying out their duties and the remit they would have.  This question could probably extend to the funding for An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well.  The local authorities, in a broad level, are responsible for a lot of climate action through transport and housing.  Decisions that local authorities take have an impact on housing and transport emissions.  However, a narrower view is to look at the operational side of a local authority.  Do the local authorities take a broader or narrower view in their climate action plans?  It is one thing for all public buildings in a local authority area to have low energy lighting, but there is a bigger impact of the local authorities in terms of climate.  That question could probably extend to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well, where the line is drawn between its operational remit and its broader remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#B00200","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>This payment is part of a five-year programme that will see significant ramping up, not just this first payment, but further larger payments, so that they can meet the requirements of the Act.  I have been travelling around the country as best as I can talking to different local authorities to encourage them in that work and listening to what they have to say on the resources they need.  This is a response.  I also told them that they should take broad perspective as to what their role is; it is not just about how they manage their own energy use within their buildings, fleets and so on.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of wider considerations.  One of the areas where we have huge potential for decarbonisation development and improving our citizens&rsquo; lot is through the development of the likes of district heating.  It can only be the local authority, particularly through its development process, that can look to target and identify, and then facilitate, support and, in many instances, manage the roll-out of such systems.  That then can be applied across a wide variety of different areas, including transport and energy.  It can be applied not only in district heating but also in improvement of their housing stock and the provisions within the development plan around renewable power generation and grid development.  Once one starts looking at it, the list of where local authorities can and should have a key role is significant.<\/p> <p>  That is connected, in a sense, to the economic development role of local authorities.  This is where a new economy and opportunities will develop.  Those councils and authorities that are ahead of the curve in being part of the decarbonisation programme will see more investment, more jobs and a wider rate base.  To answer the Chair&rsquo;s question, their function should not be seen narrowly as being about the emissions that they are directly responsible for, but rather in that wider remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that.

I thank the Minister for coming.  I congratulate him on the measures that he brought in in the budget, which the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, confirmed will protect the estimated 29% who at risk of energy poverty.  They are very welcome.  It is over the winter period and we need to revisit some of these things.  I welcome the new measures the Minister is announcing.  will come back to them.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  In respect of the energy credit going to householders, has the Minister at this stage been able to estimate how much we might recoup from the EU measures that are now in the offing?  That is, the capping of the price of electricity for the non-gas providers and the solidarity tax on the fossil fuel, and perhaps the longer-term market reform that is coming.<\/p> <p>  On the emergency temporary provision, how is the state aid being structured?  Is this a price commitment in terms of supporting the price that would be paid a capital allocation?  It will be there for just four winters at most, although this sort of equipment, presumably, has a 20-year life span or something of that nature.  What happens after that?  It seems that it would be very expensive and wasteful to take it out of the Irish system.  How is that going to happen?<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister have line of sight on the features that stalled the last auction &ndash; things such as planning, availability of equipment and compliance with environmental requirements?  Do we have clear line of sight to the effect that none of those things will obstruct this?<\/p> <p>  My final questions are on the sound and vision initiative.  As the Minister knows, I am strongly advocating for a resilience campaign around our reliance on imports.  I would like to hear that is going beyond just talking about climate and looking at the practical things that can be done.<\/p> <p>  In the context of local authority planning, no local authority, to my knowledge, has yet put in place a public electric vehicle charger with the grant that the Government makes available to them.  I know that has been changed.  However, it suggests there is a bit of a disconnect between the emergency that people are facing and the attitude of local authorities.  Can the Minister bring a little urgency into this, along with the allocation of the extra money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The amount of money raised from the measures that we have agreed at European Council, such as the inframarginal pricing and the solidarity contribution of fossil fuels, is hard to estimate exactly because it depends on so many different variables &ndash; the price of gas and, as a consequence, wholesale electricity prices.  The good news is that while they are still historically incredibly high prices, it is a fraction now of what the prices were two or three months ago.  The reduction is welcome, however, it still leaves us in a difficult situation.  It would also depend, to a certain extent, on the timelines that supply whether the measures are extended beyond original provisions and also the rates and levels that apply.  The European Union is recommending that it is beyond &euro;180 per MWh that inframarginal pricing would kick in and this windfall would be gained.  However, we have the capability of lowering that and that is something we are looking at.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, on the contribution, the European Commission is recommending 35%, or setting that as within the terms, but recognising that it could go higher.  As I said, there is work ongoing with the Department of Finance and my Department to get the details on this.  We have to have it in place before the end of the year.  We want the revenue in quickly.<\/p> <p>  I expect the inframarginal revenue to go towards reducing electricity bills directly.  That would be the best use of it.  The solidarity contribution may be useful in the context of wider supports.  We are looking at including business supports and so on.  As already stated, I estimate that it will be between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion, but we will have more specifics on that in the coming weeks when we agree the final details, the timelines and so on.<\/p><p>With regard to the emergency purchasing of aeroderivative jet engines, I thank the Chair and the committee for their involvement.  The timeline and speed of progressing the legislation, along with the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny for aspects of this, which we have had to do, has been extraordinary.  It is unfortunate and we would prefer not to be in this situation.  We are doing it to make sure that we have sufficient power supply next winter.  The provisions came from the CRU asking that EirGrid would purchase the equipment.  We are supporting that.  It is the last resort.  The timeline potentially goes to the winter of 2026-27, as I said in my opening remarks.  The expectation is that the generators deploying them would have to sell on the relevant equipment.  In my mind, we can probably recoup revenue to recover some of these costs.  We have not provided for this because it is an unknown.  I expect there will be a significant return to Revenue when that is done, and then, as the Deputy said, that equipment can then be used in a range of other operations.  My expectation and preference is that it will be used on the island of Ireland because we will need fast-reacting open-cycle distillate, gas-fired or hydrogen-fired backup generation, which is what the equipment that we will contract in the coming days or weeks will provide.  We are not providing for it in the Estimates because it is an unknown, but I expect there will be a significant return to the State at the end of this emergency process, when it is unwound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00600","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

It is too complicated and some of its provisions are too contradictory.  That is the first and most urgent lesson that we learned.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding the sound and vision fund.  The definition of how that applies to climate and the reduction of our dependence on fossil fuels is central to our current climate difficulties.

I have a couple of quick questions.  The first relates to an issue he touched on.  How will those without a meter point reference number, MPRN, get their electricity grant?  It seems from reading his submission that he has not quite figured out how that will be dispensed.  Will he comment on whether that will definitely go to the Traveller community, which did not get to avail of it last time, and how that will be done?  I will raise another matter again, which is a hot political topic at the moment.  How will the Minister guarantee that there are no disconnections of those with prepaid meters or those with hefty bills from district heating systems, where much higher tariffs apply?<\/p> <p>  The main question that I want to ask is about the emergency generation plans and the &euro;350 million that is being voted.  Some &euro;200 million has been spent and there is &euro;150 million for the autumn.  That is all done and dusted.  It is necessary, but it bothers me that there is no scrutiny of why it is necessary.  We need to revisit that.  The Minister is looking far into the future to 2026, 2027 and 2028, when we may still require this type of plant, yet the State is continuing to connect data centres to the grid when we know that they are soaking up increasingly large volumes of energy.  Should we not, at some point, stop scrambling to purchase extra equipment but instead stop the connection of extra data centres when we know that they are the cause of the increase in our energy use?  The Minister mentioned the war in Ukraine, but the data centre issue is extraneous to that and we have information from the CRU that shows our electricity demand has grown by 9% over the past five years compared with 27 EU countries, which have approximately 0% growth in their energy demand.  Ours is continually growing, which is clearly because of the growth of the data centre industry here.<\/p> <p>  My last question is about climate research.  Why do we have money back from climate research?  Why did we not spend the funding when we know from the biodiversity report that there is little hard evidence on the decline of many species in this country and that we should research that and spend the funding to examine how and why this is happening so that we can try to redress the problem and protect endangered species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#D00400","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I confirm that we will make sure that Traveller families will get the cash payments that 99.5% or 99.6% of households got in the first tranche.  We know that it works.  Where there were anomalies or communities were left out, such as certain families within the Traveller community, we will work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and with local authorities to make sure that they get the payment this autumn just like every other household.<\/p> <p>  Disconnections are a critical issue.  We recognise that it may be a difficult period for a variety of different customers, whether they are on bill pay schemes or not.  Many families with pay-as-you-go services find that it is a useful mechanism.  We should be careful not to depict all the problems as being in just one sector.  Many people with bill pay services also have difficulties and we have to protect them.  The mechanisms to help families on pay-as-you-go services first and foremost involve having a good, close relationship with the supplier and the application of the support mechanisms that it has in place to ensure that households do not have to disconnect themselves in a way that they do not want to.  CRU has developed a range of other measures, including the right to access lower tariffs.  One measure that we will look at from our energy poverty action plan, which will be published in the next few weeks, is a review of gas connections as well as electricity to see if there are measures to take there to improve people's situations, particularly the relatively small number of but still important households which have hardship meters.  How do we get better provisions for them?  We have not finished introducing measures to help those households.  We will continue to review and to make sure that the State helps them through what will be a difficult winter period.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why we need to switch off the scheme and why we would not keep generators running in 2028 and 2029.  This is an emergency measure.  It is not the only measure in place.  We also have the T-4 and T-3 auctions.  The majority of the 2 GW of backup gas-fired power will come through those auction processes.  We need a significant investment, which we are now seeing, in battery storage and additional renewables, through the renewable energy strategy.  That is working and it is delivering.  The volume of power from renewable power generation has never been as significant as this year.  That is how we will make sure that we do it.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that we had a problem with having to make sure that any new data centres fit in within our energy security and climate targets.

We recognise that it was an issue.<\/p><p>We have acted to change the rules and approach the State takes to contracting new data centres.  It is not saying \"No\".

The scale of the price increases has put people right across society in real difficulty.  Often people may be outside the social welfare system and in various circumstances, and I think it is appropriate they get a payment during these difficult times.  Once we start to do that, then, do we agree to undertake provisions through electricity bills?  I ask this because it would not be possible to do it through gas payments, because only 42% of households have gas connections, or any other mechanism.  It was appropriate to take this approach.<\/p> <p>  The cost to start differentiating, the time delay and the bureaucratic complications involved in trying to change the entire database system, or to try to manipulate it to categorise payments based on income or on whether it is a first or second home, would not have delivered the credit in time.

The payment next month, on 1 November, will come just at the right time.

This is how we could have got money into people's pockets very quickly.  The MPRN scheme took months the last time before the money hit people's accounts.

This strategy was submitted to us last year.  The authors worked out and identified the supports in this regard.  This Supplementary Estimate is now responding to that endeavour.  It has taken the analysis provided to us regarding what capacity requirements local authorities have and has suggested ways of funding it.  This approach encompasses all 31 local authorities delivering phase 1.

Stakeholder engagement is also involved.<\/p> <p>  There are two key specialised resource requirements.

I ask him for his views on prepay meters.  He is leaving much to the CRU.  Many people on these prepay meters are actually paying a higher tariff for their electricity.  They are also paying a higher standing charge.  That seems extremely unfair because the provider is actually guaranteed payment whereas if someone had an ordinary meter, the provider is not guaranteed payment until it is actually paid.  Has the Minister asked the CRU the justification for them having the right to charge a higher rate?  One would think people with a prepay meter should actually get it at a discounted rate.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the extra money allocated to reduce public transport fares for students and commuters.  That is great, but the policy is only as good as it works out in practice and there seems to be a big gap between the policy and the practice particularly in north Kildare.  My home town has Maynooth University.  I am inundated with students who are delighted with the reduced transport charge but they cannot get the buses.  The buses are full or they are not turning up.  Sometimes they are standing up and in the case of an accident they would be like human missiles.  The buses are full.  The policy is great, but more work needs to be done on delivery so that it works in practice.  How does the transport plan work with the living with Covid a plan?  Many drivers are not able to turn up to work because they have Covid.

What the Deputy said is true; buses are starting to fill up.  The numbers using public transport are rising significantly on the back of the end of the Covid pandemic, but also as a result of lower fares.  Many bus services are not providing the reliable services that we expect.  It is the role of the National Transport Authority and my Department to ensure that they do.  This has included the issuing of fines for companies which have not applied.  Many of the difficulties have related to the ability to get drivers.  We are considering further measures for how we can help to support and facilitate that.  I absolutely accept it is not satisfactory particularly when buses do not turn up on schedule and people are left at the stop which can also lead to buses being over-full.  We need to change that.<\/p> <p>  The issue of prepay meters is complex.  There are different circumstances for gas and electricity.  Different types of meters are involved.  There are also different types of customers.  Many people are using prepay meters because it provides a very useful service.  It is a very attractive way to manage paying and for many people reducing energy use and their bills.  The complexity of that is that a number of different companies are involved.  Not every company uses prepay meters but those that do have a variety of tariffs, often better and innovative tariffs to support customers.  The standing charge and the per-use charge vary because suppliers try to attract customers with that.  There is an issue with those who are in difficulty.  We need to address that and the CRU has done a lot of work already.<\/p> <p>  Included in that is the requirement to ensure that those who are in difficulty are not paying the highest charges.  As we go through this winter, we will try to ensure that the discounted tariffs are made available to those most in need of them as well as other supports.  In two weeks' time we will publish an energy action plan which will outline further measures that we may seek to deliver in conjunction with the CRU.  We are doing considerable work monitoring the consumer protection measures.  We will not rest with whatever is there.  It means looking at it and ensuring we adjust if people are left in difficulties.  We do not want anyone disconnected this summer, least of all those at risk of fuel poverty who do not have the heat and the power that they need.<\/p> <p>  Officials from my Department are meeting both suppliers and the NGOs to understand the issues on the ground.

It is clear that the solidarity contribution will only in effect really apply to one company, the Corrib gas field.  With inframarginal it is complex because there are generating companies, such as wind farms, but they may have sold on power through a long-term contract at low rates to a supplier company or supplier-like company.  We are saying we will not just apply inframarginal pricing to the generating companies, but we will also apply it to those suppliers and supplier-like companies if they are gaining a windfall profit from these very high market prices for fossil fuel and gas.<\/p><p>Then one is into the complexity of each different generator in terms of what its arrangements are.
