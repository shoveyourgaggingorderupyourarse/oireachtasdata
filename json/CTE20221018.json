Today, we are paying particular attention to health and related matters.  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the HSE.  We are joined by: Mr. Bernard O'Regan, head of operations, disability services; Professor Malcolm MacLachlan, clinical lead for the national clinical programme for people with disability; Mr. Brian Higgins, head of change, planning and delivery, disability and mental health services; Ms Mary O&rsquo;Kelly, chief officer in community healthcare for Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow; and Dr. Graham Connon, principal clinical psychologist, community healthcare office for Dublin north, north-central and north-west.  We are grateful to the witnesses for taking time to contribute to this public session of the committee.<\/p> <p>  Health is a central issue for the autistic community, even as we move to adopt a less medical-side model of understanding autism.  The committee is interested in discussing a range of issues with the representatives, such as assessments of need, staffing and other issues relating to children's disability network teams, staffing issues in general, diagnosis of children and adults, and delays in accessing therapies.  We would also like to hear an update on the implementation of the recommendations of the review of the health services for individuals with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  Without access to assessment of needs, autistic children and adults struggle to access the necessary school places, therapies and supports that would allow them to thrive in society.  The committee is aware that autistic people face significant barriers in accessing adequate health services and we are committed to addressing these issues and developing a roadmap towards a resolution in our final report, which will be laid before both Houses next March.<\/p> <p>  To date, the committee has focused on the area of education and we are very interested in hearing from the representatives of the HSE regarding how the health service can better support autistic children in primary and secondary schools and in third level institutions.  We will later turn our attention to autistic people in employment.  The committee is also interested in how we can make buildings more autism-friendly.  That applies to us in Leinster House as it applies to every facet of society.<\/p> <p>  I thank the HSE for the written statement and comprehensive briefing note that have been supplied.  Before we hear from the HSE, I propose that we publish the opening statement and briefing note to the committee website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Regan to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#B00175","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend to discuss services and supports for autistic children and adults.  The HSE is responsible for developing, providing and funding health and social care services for autistic children and adults.  It does this in the context of legislation, national policy, the UN convention and other international conventions, and the funding provided by the State.<\/p> <p>  The HSE established the service improvement board for the autistic community to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the review of the Irish health services for individuals with autism spectrum disorder, which was completed in November 2017.  The board consists of senior operational and clinical decision-makers, independent professional and academic support and, importantly, representation of persons with lived experience of autism, participating as equal members of this important collaborative team effort.  This is reflected in the membership of each of the two working groups.  Its work will shape how services can be delivered to autistic people and create greater awareness of autism to promote inclusion and fostering positive attitudes.  The agreed set of priorities are to implement a programme of awareness-raising and engagement with the public, and to build professional capacity and competence among key professionals working with autistic people, including the implementation of a tiered model of assessment.<\/p> <p>  As regards the awareness working group, information available to the autistic community, family members and service providers was limited and inconsistent and did not always reflect current understanding and approaches.  The HSE has taken a comprehensive approach to addressing this and is reviewing existing content, seeking the views of all stakeholders on said content, reviewing what is available in other jurisdictions and working to ensure it can be made accessible online and in print.  This quality process has been progressing and will continue into next year.  The awareness stream of the programme is designed to respond to the call for greater clarity in respect of autism and the supports available to autistic people, looking at the availability of comprehensive, accessible information for autistic people, families and staff and the public, and supporting AsIAm to provide a national phone line to provide the autistic community with access to useful information.  It involves the development of an online information and knowledge hub combined with a helpline aimed at providing contemporary information in respect of services, resources and signposting to other essential community and statutory-based supports and services.<\/p> <p>  The assessment and pathways working group aims to develop a standardised assessment approach for use in all services dealing with the assessment of those with autism to ensure that every assessment is of an agreed standard.  It also seeks to agree a standardised service journey and the implementation of a consistent core service offering across those providing services to people with autism.  The working group has consulted widely with key stakeholders in the development of the project and this was particularly important in the context of the implementation of a tiered approach to assessment.  Its main focus is to develop an operational model for a tiered approach to autism assessment through developing clear and functioning pathways to services.  This will contribute to the national clinical programme for people with disability, NCPPD, producing a model of service, including initial and ongoing assessment.  There will be an implementation plan to include training which takes cognisance of existing policies of the HSE, along with the development of processes or supporting protocols.  The draft protocol is currently being piloted in two community healthcare organisations and its next phase will bring that up to four community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  By way of update, a third CHO has now committed to piloting it and we are engaging with the fourth CHO at the moment.<\/p> <p>  As regards services to children and families, the HSE is committed to providing high-quality health and social care services to all service users, including those with disabilities and their families.  The HSE fully accepts that there are significant challenges in current service provision, the level of unmet need and engagement and communications with service users and families.  The HSE, in collaboration with Department officials, is working to develop an overarching roadmap to progress the next phase of implementation of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People.  The document will broadly address the key areas of: communications and engagement with families and service users; activity data and their collation and sharing pending the roll-out of the new integrated management system for the teams; workforce planning to support increased recruitment of required skilled staff; family-centred practice and supports to teams as they transition to an interdisciplinary and family-centred model of service; education sector engagement, including the establishment of local education and health forums in all CHO areas; a process for review of the implementation of the progressing disability service, PDS, model; and assessments of need, AON, and the challenges presented by the legislative requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, including HSE proposals to address the ongoing requirements for assessments of need and associated waiting lists.  The document will include prioritisation, timelines and dependencies. <\/p> <p>  The HSE has developed a waiting list initiative to address the AON waiting list, in addition to a commitment put in place earlier this year to provide 1,000 assessments for autistic children.<\/p><p>The HSE's children&rsquo;s disability services have been reorganised under the progressing disability services, PDS, programme.  The aim at the heart of PDS is to achieve fair access to services for all children with disabilities, based on need.  Making that happen is one of the most complex change programmes undertaken within our health and social service, and while we have made progress, we have a lot more to do before it is complete.  Services are moving from being professionally-centred to being family- and person-centred.  When services are family and person centred the team of professionals and the family are equal partners, co-designing services to meet individual needs.  The family brings knowledge of their child and the team brings its expertise.  Together they agree on goals and how they will be achieved.<\/p><p> The HSE is facing some specific challenges in children&rsquo;s services, including a high level of staff vacancies on our children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, a limited employment market and meeting the concerns and needs of children and families.  We also need to strengthen adult disability services.  Waiting lists and caseloads are a challenge and we must ensure we can prioritise children or adults by their need for specialist or more routine services.  It is not acceptable for an individual to have to wait an extended time for either an assessment of their needs, or for supports and therapies needed by people with autism.  We recognise that difficulties accessing services create additional stress for families.  Our programme of reform is intended to ensure that children have timely access to services based on need.  The HSE regrets the negative experience of individuals and families where the current service may fall short of what is needed to meet their needs.  We are fully committed to addressing these problems and always welcome suggestions about improving our approach to doing so.  This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I have been going through Mr. O'Regan's opening statement and there are three points that I want to pick out.  I welcome the development of the online knowledge hub and \"providing contemporary information in relation to services, resources, and signposting to other essential community and statutory based supports and services\".  It is grand to be told where to go but the biggest problem we have is accessing the services.  The big bugbear I hear about is the AON, which is a huge one.  The waiting lists for this are growing every day.  I spoke to a family yesterday, including a 14-year-old boy who is in school.  The school has been extremely supportive.  The boy has a lot of issues and learning difficulties and he finds it successful when he is using the laptop but he is on a two-year waiting list to get the assessment.  While the school is supporting him with a laptop, because he cannot get the AON to say he needs it, the HSE and the Department of Education cannot approve the laptop and, therefore, that laptop will be taken off that child before he goes to do his exam in June.  That is causing immense stress for the individual and the family because that child's mother is now the teacher.  I have had numerous cases like this, and I have been lucky that the individual who helps me with this goes to the High Court to push for the AONs.  We are in 2022 and this should not be happening.  The statement says the services should be family- and person-centred and that if there are specific cases they should be dealt with but is there any other avenue where the likes of I and others can go when there is an urgency?  They are probably all urgent cases and that is where the crux of the issue is.  What can we do and what do you say to a family in this situation?  This is probably one of the least complicated cases I have come across when it comes to autism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#C00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I will comment on that and my colleagues may want to comment as well.  The starting point is that the example the Deputy gave is not an acceptable situation and not one that anybody coming in to provide supports and services wants to see happen.  People are working to improve that.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the statutory AON side first.  We have to work within the legislation and the requirements of the Act.  We had developed a standard operating procedure on AON, which was found in March of this year to not be compliant with the Act.  That has had an impact at a time we had almost cleared the backlog and were beginning to get on top of the issue of recreating delays in the service again.  We are also finding ourselves in a challenging situation whereby the same staff who we need to do interventions, which is ultimately the goal of the services, are generally the same staff who are required to undertake AON as well.  We have a waiting list initiative and we have been resourced to progress it.  That will lead to us endeavouring to procure, including internationally, anything we can to address the formal AON process.  Professor MacLachlan might want to comment on the following point as well.  We have progressed some work on clinical guidance on how clinicians might undertake the assessments themselves.  That is something we are addressing through the HSE structures and under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  We are engaging with the unions to progress that and we hope to bring it to a conclusion in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  An AON is not required under the Disability Act 2005 to access the service.  A referral to the service can be made based on need.  In that context, any clinician working with a child should be able to determine what a child's needs are and make recommendations with the family.  The case the Deputy has used is a good example of how that might be progressed.  The challenge is the availability of staffing.  Teams are severely depleted and they have significant caseloads so the capacity of the teams to be able to meet the needs of children is challenged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Following Justice Phelan's finding that the previous standard operating procedure was non-compliant with the Act, the national clinical programme for people with disabilities had a large-scale consultation involving over 80 people, including service users.  We developed new interim clinical guidance to support clinicians in how to go about doing an AON.  We were able to do all of that and have it signed off within the clinical system within six weeks.  We are now waiting for legal advice to confirm its appropriateness and as Mr. O'Regan was saying, we are addressing it through the WRC.<\/p> <p>  On another element of what the Deputy is mentioning, a particular challenge in the Irish system is whether one needs an AON or not.  As Mr. O'Regan said, there is a right to access services but it is not a requirement.  What has happened in our school system - and I am sure the Deputy will be aware that the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004 is under revision - is that a practice developed where schools would ask for a diagnosis because they would feel that would enhance their chances of getting an SNA or additional technology, whereas neither in the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act or the Disability Act is a diagnosis required to access these supports.<\/p><p>That is a custom that has developed but the latest research strongly suggests we should be addressing our people's needs rather than focusing more narrowly on their diagnoses.  Disability services are needs-led and it is a bit confusing because assessment of needs is a legal entitlement but, when assessing a child or adult, you would be trying to find out their needs, rather than simply their diagnosis.  While recognising the importance of diagnosis for people's identity and sense of empowerment etc., from a clinical point of view it is not the most critical thing in ensuring that person gets the services they need to support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>When Professor MacLachlan says it is clinician-led, does he mean even a GP or does it have to be an occupational therapist?  The professor works on the clinical side but, unfortunately,  we do not have in this country a bit of empathy or a common-sense approach.  In the majority of these schools, SNAs, teachers and principals go above and beyond because they are with them nearly as long as the parents, so they know the children.  If I go back to that family and tell them to go to their GP, can the GP assist them and write a recommendation letter in order they can go to the Department of Education, outline the situation and ask for it to be sorted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#D00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Buckley for the question.

If not, their local primary care centre is a huge point of contact and should be able to signpost them.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have a dearth of clinicians, within primary care and disabilities there are occupational therapists who assess children with regard to technology for the school environment.  They do not need to go through the legislative assessment of need process to gain that.  Also, in many areas of the country, they are able to self-refer and do not need to go through a GP.

To be honest, I am not sure I exited it a great deal wiser than I entered it.<\/p> <p>  I often talk about how I used to be a primary teacher.  I was often the first person a parent met who tried to put a name to what they knew about their child.  They knew there was something there but I might be the person to say it was possibly autism, dyslexia or dyspraxia.  That is a big thing for a parent to deal with.  I used to always try to emphasise that a label does not limit or disable a child; it should enable him or her and be a toolkit giving access to the tools needed to make sure a child reaches his or her full potential.  If it is a toolkit, it remains locked until the assessment.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding what Ms O'Kelly said, if we are taking about assessment and standardised pathways, we cannot have that fragmented approach whereby a Teachta D&aacute;la such as Deputy Buckley does not know where to begin with a family.  I cannot point him to the pathways because it is too fragmented.  Ms O'Kelly spoke about referral to a CDNT, but in many areas they are extremely understaffed and struggling to get to the people they already have with outstanding assessments.  I do not see how speaking about approaching them informally makes sense, if we are trying to standardise assessment pathways and, after that, pathways to services.  <\/p> <p>  The incidence rate of autism across a population is relatively predictable, whatever figure we take for that.  One in 68 is one figure.  I would not like to stand over that and do not have the level of expertise to do so.  The witnesses will know better.  That means in any given cohort of young people moving through school, we should have a clear idea of how many of them are likely to require an assessment.  What modelling are we using?  What are the best estimates on current need?  If we get there, let us work backwards.  If we know on a population level how many people in a cohort are likely to need an assessment, how many hours do we need to provide the assessment for that number of people?  If we know how many hours we need in order to provide assessment, we know how many staff we need.  We have to unlock that toolkit for parents.<\/p> <p>  Practitioners and GPs up and down the country are meeting parents in that stressed space of knowing something is happening, maybe putting a name to it for the first time and then saying to a parent \"I think it might be this but I'm not sure when we're going to get an assessment for you\".  There may only be two assessments available in that school this year, for example.  Then are we telling parents they can go private?  Not every parent has the means to go private. <\/p> <p> Will the witnesses talk to me about that?   We should be able to model across the population how many people are likely to be autistic and, from that, to infer how many hours we need for assessment.  From there, we should be able to infer how many posts we need to fill.  Will the witnesses give me an answer on some of that please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#D01000","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  It is instructive to look at some of the statistics.  We have about one third of children on waiting lists to receive services and we also have about one third of posts on CDNTs vacant.  I do not suggest it is an exact match but if we had those CDNTs fully resourced, then we would probably be able to provide services to everybody who needs them.<\/p> <p>  In developing the protocol, we do not want an approach whereby every child gets the same number of hours of assessment.  It is important that the assessments are tailored to the complexity of the presentation.  A challenge we had before was that we had assessments that took 60, 70 or, in some cases, over 100 hours and clinicians would feel a thorough assessment required that level of detail.  The protocol we have been developing involves a tiered approach where some children could be assessed in as little as three hours and others may well take over 100 hours.  It is not simply a matter of drawing the average.  We are trialling the protocol that has been developed.  For the 19 people who have gone through the protocol at the moment, 11 have been assessed at tier 1.  That is within a five-hour timeframe, maximum.

I appreciate Mr. O'Regan's comments conveying regret to families.  Many families who are at their wits' end are watching proceedings.  They feel helpless because they have not been able to get services for their children.  They do not know to where to turn.  They are turning to us politicians and we do not have the answers either.  Our guests have the answers.  I am not sure whether any of our guests are the architects of the CDNT model but that is the system within which they are working.  It is not a system that is working very well.  I am glad that it is being reviewed and that changes are being made.<\/p> <p>  We know anecdotally that 55,000 children are waiting for an assessment of needs.  Our guests might update that figure and tell me where we are and how many children nationwide are waiting for assessments of need.<\/p> <p>  It is great that Professor MacLachlan is bringing in a new system and protocol around the assessment of need but it is ridiculous that it was not done previously.  It is clear that assessment does not take 100 hours for every child.  What the professor said is welcome, and it was great to hear.  That type of practical vision is needed across the HSE.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Buckley, reported on a constituent of his.  It is definitely cheaper to supply a laptop in such a situation than to pay professionals to carry out an assessment of need.  Some parents are told to go to the High Court and their children will then get an assessment of need within a month because the HSE moves to a different budget to respond in such cases.  There must be more practical ways to look at these issues.<\/p> <p>  If I were to look at the CDNT model from the perspective a cost-benefit analysis, as someone such as Michael O'Leary would, I would say of course we should have people working from community centres.  We could have therapists working 12 months of the year.  They would not be in school settings.  That could be considered the way to get the most out of them.  However, we also must consider the journey for parents.  Many working parents have children with autism and other disabilities and it is very difficult for them to take time out of work to bring their children to all the different appointments necessary.  I know many parents who tell me their places of work have given up on them and they are unable to take any more days off.  Those parents then have their own journeys whereby they are almost being bullied by their employers because they are taking time off and perhaps are working less hard than they were previously.  It is difficult.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that Professor MacLachlan mentioned educational engagement, which is crucial.  That is the missing link here.  The CDNT network is there but it must be redirected towards schools around the country.  Therapists must be in the schools because parents cannot be dragging their kids to therapy appointments.  Many parents do not have the means or wherewithal to do so.  It is unfair.  For a child from a family at a social disadvantage, it is not going to be a priority to bring that child to an appointment with an occupational therapist or a speech and language therapist.  We have a super education system.  It is ingrained in us that people need to bring their children to school.  Therapies must be delivered in a school setting.  Our guests much push for that delivery.<\/p> <p>  There is a one third vacancy rate.  I asked a few occupational therapists and speech and language therapists why they do not want to work in the HSE or the CDNTs.  They told me they do not like it and they do not like the politics involved.  They said they do not get much interaction with children because there is a concentration on family engagement and teaching the parents.  Those young therapists want to be working directly with kids.  They like the idea of working in a school-type environment.  These are young women who are not motivated by money and are not going to be whipped into providing an enormous amount of hours.  They would love to work in a school-type environment where they know their children and environment.  The children are happier because they are not being dragged to appointments.  We must consider the ethos within the CDNTs.  Why do people, the majority of whom are women, not want to work in the CDNTs?  The education piece is the answer to that.  We need to push therapists back into the schools via the CDNTs, because that is the structure in place.  It would allow therapists to have a school they know and attend.  They could build up a rapport with other staff members.  That is crucial.<\/p> <p>  I agree with much of what my colleagues have said about AON, but that is a monster in itself.  My message today, which our guests might pass on, is that we should redirect our resources, or as much as possible, towards the schools.  We are always going to have children who are not in school settings and who will have to be given therapies in the community.  However, for the majority of children, especially considering the increase in ASD classes and early intervention classes, the key is delivering therapies in a school setting.<\/p> <p>  Professor MacLachlan referred to a diagnosis and, unfortunately, a diagnosis is crucial in Ireland because a child cannot get into an early intervention class or an ASD class without a diagnosis.  Nobody needs a diagnosis.  The only reason a diagnosis is necessary, as my colleague said, is to access the necessary tools because no matter what, those tools cannot be accessed without a diagnosis.  The education piece is key.  Diagnoses are required for early intervention, home tuition and level 7 support under the access and inclusion model, AIM.  That is key.  The diagnosis cannot be downgraded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#E00700","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I have tried to capture a few things in terms of the response I am going to give the Senator.

We are working on that at the moment.  I think that the challenge with putting services into schools is as follows.  I understand the benefits of this but there are also some gaps that are still there.  Special schools are only one part of the educational domain that is there.  We also have, as was mentioned, special classes.  We also have many children, including autistic children, who are in mainstream schools and who need supports.  One cannot put something into every school.  It is a question of how this is managed.  I think the design and the thinking behind the CDNT is that there is a service in a local community that is for the population of children in that community, regardless of their location, but we are looking to do something in the special schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I am more saying that with the CDNTs, it does not have to be a dedicated person, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#F00400","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>That is the model we are looking to put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>-----if there were a team that could service four or five mainstream classes and ASD classes-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#F00600","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>It is a matter of physically getting a parent and a child to another part of the city.

The point is more that children are in lots of different environments and that the service needs to work with families, teaching staff and whoever else in order to support children in all their environments, and the model of service needs to reflect that.  Nowhere in the model does it say that staff should not or cannot work in schools.  If they are working with children, they should be looking at what the needs of the children are regardless of the environment and then figuring out what the right intervention is.  There is no issue with staff going in and working in schools, but it is important also that we have a way of working with families in order that we are also mindful of the other environments a child is in and we are providing wholesome and full support that is targeted not just on the educational needs of the child but on their broader needs as well.<\/p> <p>  Was there something Ms O'Kelly wanted to come in on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I do not mind adding to that.

It is the learning in the home environment after the session and that translation of what was learnt in the session to all the other aspects of one's home life.

The point I was trying to make was that it is important within the Irish system, almost for the wrong reasons, that a diagnosis is needed to access supports and services, whereas that should not be the case.  I have here a quote from the top journal in this area, which is called <i>The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry<\/i>.  Each year it does a sort of annual review whereby people put together a huge amount of information.  Last year the review was published on the transdiagnostic revolution in neurodevelopmental disorders.  The authors' conclusion at the end of a very long paper synthesising a lot of evidence is that &quot;an overreliance on ill-fitting diagnostic criteria is impeding progress towards identifying the barriers that children encounter, understanding underpinning mechanisms and finding the best route to supporting them&quot;.  I absolutely agree that within our system this is important.  It has too much importance and, as I said, that is, I think, one of the reasons the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act is being reviewed.  From the perspective of people with autism, I think it would also be important to review the Disability Act in order that we have those two interlocking Acts evolving at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#F01700","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Regan for his presentation and for the other interventions as well.

When we started the pilot, as the Deputy will know, it was a cross-government initiative.  My CHO region, encompassing Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow, was the pilot site.  As the Deputy will know, the pilot comprehended a number of primary schools and secondary schools.  We then employed a team comprising some of our own staff via expression of interest and other staff from national recruitment panels.  The key stakeholders in the pilot were the NCSE, the local HSE team in the CHO region and what is now the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  When we hired the staff there was not a model for the school inclusion, so the first year was what I would call almost the preplanning stage, whereby this team of occupational therapists and speech and language therapists has to look at international evidence and build a model, with the NCSE really leading in respect of the schools and engagement with the schools, the principals and the board of management.  They developed a three-tier model.  The committee may have heard a little about that in other sessions.  The model was a universal model, which should be applied to everybody regardless of complexity, recognising that, with children with complex needs, the teachers still need a universal level of knowledge and understanding and capacity-building for the classroom.  Tier 2 was a more targeted response to children in the classroom.<\/p><p> Tier 3 was for the children who were more complex and that was almost a treatment intervention in a classroom setting.  The whole model was based on school inclusion rather than build capacity in the whole of the child's life.  That is really appropriate as children spend most of their young lives in school but from a health point of view, such as participation in community scouts, sports, GAA or whatever.  How to ride a bike was not included in any of that.  The first year was spent in the pre-planning stage, developing the model, getting it into schools and building tier 1.  Then tiers 2 and 3 were being introduced.  The core of the model was school inclusion, so the NCSE looked to take on the project.  We were to exit the project in summer 2020 but Covid hit in March and schools were closed.  The model was within the walls of a school.  It was not during the summer, during holidays or at Christmas, which is new for clinicians in health because they work all year round.  When Covid hit, staff were redeployed as part of the Covid response and then the NCSE took over.  So the CHO and the HSE do not participate in the school inclusion model now.

In rural locations like Ardara in County Donegal, there is little or no support for autistic children.  Parents have resorted to setting up groups in these areas so that all special needs children can meet once a week.  It is very tough to secure supports in rural communities.  The people seated around this table are not to blame.  I understand that in this job we talk a lot about funding, etc.  As a public representative, however, I believe that there are two parts to this issue.  One is being diagnosed and two is to meet the needs of each child.  What is the solution for people in rural Ireland?  Can the HSE delegation tell us what we can be done to better the lives of children in rural Ireland?  Not only have these counties been forgotten about but, most importantly, rural children have been forgotten about as there are more services and access to services in cities.<\/p> <p>  I am going to throw a spanner in the works by saying that children from ethnic minority groups can be autistic or have additional needs.  I did not see it or hear that aspect named in any of the sessions this morning.  It is important that children on the margins of society are included and provided with equal access and have their cultural needs met.  I know many Traveller children who are autistic and there are more of them now than in previous years, there have also been a large number of missed diagnoses and families did not know that there were supports.  How do we support these families and children?<\/p> <p>  How does the HSE ensure that disabled persons' organisations are a priority in its work?  These are groups that need to advocate for our children and parents as well.  I knew about AsIAm, as an organisation, before I was ever a Senator.  I am aware of its work on inclusion.<\/p> <p>  I have listened to other members.  What solutions can the witnesses from the HSE, as professionals, suggest?  I ask because we are not professionals.  I know people who have autistic children and I know people from within my community who have autistic children or are autistic but I am not a professional.  What solutions can we, as a committee, include in our recommendations?  I ask because we, as members, get only one bite at the cherry because we only have this committee for a short period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#G01100","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Again, my colleagues might comment on some aspects.  In a previous role, I worked with an organisation that was located in a rural county and that provided services to children and adults with disabilities, including those with autism.  The model we operated comprised a team of clinicians who provided therapy and conducted assessments.  That team predated the CDNTs but, in effect, was one.<\/p><p>We also had a range of other supports to work in conjunction with the team.  These included autism resource workers, personal assistants, home support and all these kinds of supports.  They were working in conjunction with the team so that direct supports were provided to a child or family where they were.  It helped to enable implementation of the recommendations a therapist might make.  In many respects, apart from providing direct support to the child, some of those staff also played a key worker role and were able to act as a bridge between different components of the service and to support families in navigating the services.  As we develop the services, and we want to develop the clinical services, we must be mindful that other supports and services that people need must also be developed.<\/p><p> As regards rural communities, these services must be agile enough.  There are examples of where agile services have been developed in rural areas that have been responsive.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  Sometimes this is about investing but it involves parallel investment and growing these kinds of services together.  My colleagues may wish to contribute on other aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Regarding the CDNTs, I know we often seem defensive about them.

The fact that the service is not appropriately resourced does not mean the model is wrong.  If one is interested in social equity and having equal access regardless of where people live, how wealthy they are and what sort of school they go to, then a community-based model where specialised services are provided in the community is exactly the right way to go.  Of course, the model must be resourced.<\/p> <p>  Regarding people's experience of autism, I am sure members are well aware that, for instance, women and men can experience and express autism in different ways.  It is the same with different cultural groups.  If we take on board the idea of neurodiversity and intersectionality, that is, the different ways in which people are oppressed, effectively, influencing how they express their experience of autism, this brings us to the operating model of the CDNTs, which is needs-focused.  It is focused on individuals and their families.  It is they who determine the outcomes they want to achieve.  Again, this is because we cannot put people in a box and tell them they have X and this is how they should be treated.  There must be much more individualisation and this approach takes on board those intersectional experiences people have.<\/p> <p>  I hear the Senator's frustration.

There are challenges in the delivery of this approach.  We are trying to move from a clinically-based model to a socially-based model and from a location-based approach to one that is family-based.  In this regard, Deputy Buckley gave the important example of educators and families being able to identify what interventions are required.

Ms O'Kelly and Mr. O'Regan referred to an assessment of need not being required.  Many of the families I deal with tell me they are being told they do need an assessment of need.  They are being told by clinicians, day in and day out, they will not be able to access services unless they have that piece of paper in their hands.  Can it be confirmed again that an assessment of need is not required and can that message be conveyed to the other clinicians putting up these obstacles?<\/p><p>I am sure all Members of these Houses come across this daily.  People are told that unless they have an assessment of need done, they will not get into the services.  The second issue is that more and more families that come to me are told that they have to take part in parent support classes and family forums.  I want to know if this is a change in policy in the HSE.  The families tell me that this deprives them of one-to-one services that their children need.  Many of the people who are going to these classes come out with a lack of understanding of how they should deal with their children when they come out of the classes because the classes are quite complex.

It states that there are more than 7,000 children for the children's team to address, in addition to a full adult caseload.  It states that in this context, it has to manage the expectations of families who are requesting support.  Will the witnesses comment on where respite care stands?  Respite care is essential for many families that I deal with, but this is the reply they are getting.<\/p><p> I refer to the launch that Ms O'Kelly said happened in Athy last week.  It was influential and it is good that it happened.  Where does it go next?  I found what was happening at the launch insightful.

Ms O'Kelly will address the question on Athy.  I will not deal with them in order, if that is okay.<\/p> <p>  We are provided with funding each year to provide respite.  Respite services were impacted during the couple of years of Covid because of capacity and infection prevention and control, but they are getting back to normal levels of service this year.  We were also provided with funding to increase respite services in 2021 and 2022.  Those services are either in place or are being put in place.  We agreed with the CHOs and service providers that where funding was allocated, for example, as full-year funding for a new development which would not be in place until the second half of the year, it would still get full-year funding to provide alternative respite, including summer schemes and so on.  That would mean the full resource was available to be used.  It would be fair to say that there is a gap in respite services.  It is better in some areas of the country than others for all kinds of historical reasons and due to funding streams at the time.  We are trying to grow the respite capacity for both children and adults across the country.  That takes time.  In 2021, we were allocated funding for nine additional respite services, with one per CHO.  That makes a difference within that CHO, but it is also just one service in a large catchment area.  It takes a number of years to grow those services.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with the family forum and the group work as two separate issues.  The family forum is the structure for us to engage with families so that they become part of the overall governance of children's services.  We have always seen it as critical that the setting of a child's development goals should be done in partnership between the staff and the family.  That should be replicated at all levels of the structure.  The family forums are intended for us, at children's disability network team level, to engage with families who are connected to that service and to find a way to involve them in the service's governance.<\/p> <p>  Group work is a different focus.  It is about providing supports to children and families.  That is sometimes well done and sometimes best done in the context of group work.  It is not an alternative to individual work and support that a child might need.  There is not a change in the delivery of policy.  In the absence of full staffing levels, with a depleted service, it looks like we are doing more group work than individual work, but it is not an either-or situation.  Both types of work have merit.  I can provide some feedback that we have received from families, not just direct feedback to the HSE, but also feedback to the lead agencies about how beneficial families have found that work to be.  It is understandably frustrating for families if that is all that is on offer and there is not individual work to complement it.  I acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Connon might comment on the assessment of need.  A child or family absolutely do not need to have an assessment of need in order to access services.  I communicate this often.  We are happy to reiterate that again with regard to the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":88,"content":"<p>That decision is part of the national access policy that was agreed by the HSE between disability and primary care services.  The criteria relate to people's level and complexity of need, and whether those need to be addressed by an interdisciplinary team or in a unidisciplinary manner in primary care.  Those are the criteria that are assessed when deciding whether someone with a disability, or autism in this case, should access primary care or the children's disability network team.  Services have been consolidated, so everyone should be able to access one of those services, so there should be no cracks to fall through.  There is always a possibility that services will disagree on criteria.  A mechanism called an integrated children's services forum, ICSF, is built into the policy, which will resolve any disputes if services disagree on those criteria.  A decision will be made in that forum and a service will be assigned.  Those forums are in the process of being set up around the country.  We will hear about how they are doing.  Anecdotally, I can tell the Senator that where they have been set up, there has been a much lower than expected level of referral to integrated children's services forums.  Once clinicians understand how the referral process works, there seems to be very little disagreement.  Several forums have been cancelled because no disputes have been referred to them.

Two new respite houses are coming into service in our CHO.  One is in the Kildare area.  There are different ways of looking at respite.  We acknowledge that overnight respite is not necessarily the answer for everybody.  We are looking at after-school services, Saturday clubs, and reaching children and families in a different way which is a little more meaningful.<\/p><p>That is one piece.<\/p><p> We have had the engagements across CHO 7 covering south of Dublin and Kildare and west Wicklow.  The 11 teams have had the engagement with families.  They have invited the families in for the first engagement around the family forum.  A lot has come up and there is an awful lot of learning for us in that.  That is the idea behind the family forums.  It goes back to the fact that no matter where people live, there should be a local forum for them.  All these forums will help us meet the needs of the local population in a better way because they are telling us what the problem is rather than us making assumptions and having a blanket response, if you like, to health provision.<\/p><p> Regarding places like Athy, as the Senator said, this is Sl&aacute;intecare at the grassroots and at its best.  As the Senator saw, it is not about high-tech surgeries but the interventions that are happening on the ground to help our whole population, and to promote health rather than intervention.  Where we would like to go with Sl&aacute;intecare is the enhanced community care, ECC, programme.  It has been very much focused on adults and older persons to date.  We now need to look at the children and young persons population, be it under 18 years or under 25 years.  The progressing disabilities configuration has been huge and there is still a long way to go.  There is also the foundation of primary care, where the strategic development for children in primary care has been public health nursing and speech and language therapy.  Other services, especially therapeutic ones, have evolved and are disparate - that is the word.  They are not systematic.  If we are talking about a tiered model in which we want to focus a particular service such as a CDNT on more complex needs, a foundation is needed under that.

Having listened to my colleagues' contributions and the answers to them, I am a little confused because this dialogue is far removed from the experience parents relate to me.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we hear about every part of the public sector and all the public services.  This area comes up again and again and is by far the most challenging because of its impact on young people.<\/p> <p>  There are so many different aspects to this.  Let us consider, for example, the effect on a parent of an appointment being cancelled without proper notice being given to the parents.  I am thinking of one of the parents who appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago.  When parents have an appointment they have to take their child out of school and prepare him or her psychologically.  Then they turn up and are told they were supposed to get a text to say the appointment was cancelled.  That has happened to a number of parents who have appeared before this committee.  We can give the witnesses examples.  It just is not okay.  Can the witnesses imagine how difficult that is from the parents' perspective?  Imagine the co-ordination of services from the parents' perspective.  The witnesses have their jobs but I have parents who are trying to organise school buses to aftercare or weekend or overnight respite care.  All this is very difficult to do and is done while managing their child and trying to communicate with CDNTs, from which parents do not get responses or engagement.  From the parents' perspective, they do not care which arm of the State is dealing with these different things.  They have one child with one set of difficulties that needs resolution and there is no proactive management of that.  Not only is there no proactive management of it but sometimes it can be very difficult to get a response or the appointment is cancelled at the last minute.  I am telling the witnesses, as a public representative dealing with all aspects of the public service, that this service is the least satisfactory because of its inefficiency, how it fails to respond to parents and the impact it has on children.<\/p> <p>  I heard the witnesses say an assessment of needs is not needed.  That would be a huge relief to parents who have been told - universally in my experience, and other members agree - that an assessment is essential, which has created delays for them.  It is interesting to have that clarity.<\/p> <p>  I will talk through this as if I were a parent.  I have a concern about my child and take him to the GP.  The GP says I may need to get an assessment for autism or it may be that the child needs speech and language therapy.  Will the witnesses talk me through what can I expect?  CDNT 3 is the team that covers my area and I have cases involving children who have been waiting for therapeutic services for three and four years.  I ask the witnesses to talk to me about the waiting lists now that we are well into the post-Covid period.

First, we have recently gone out to all of the staff on the panels.  These are all of this year&rsquo;s graduates who are still in the process of varying stages of recruitment within the HSE system.  We provided them with information on what working in a children&rsquo;s disability network team, CDNT, is like.  We created a phone line for people to phone us so we can put them in contact with people to talk about the pros and cons of working in CDNTs.  A previous committee member referenced that it is not always attractive.  We think there are many things that can make it attractive for people and we are trying to convey that information.<\/p> <p>  The second thing we are doing is an ongoing international recruitment campaign.  The children&rsquo;s disability services is one of the priority areas within that.  We are working with colleagues to address issues, including, for example, the registration of those staff.

As was said earlier on, in some ways I am probably more confused than I was when I came in.  This probably reflects the frustration and confusion felt by these children and their families.  I do not think that after this meeting, they will feel there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill got to the crux of it, namely, staffing levels.  If we do not have the staffing levels, we do not have the access.  A parent who wants to get his or her child assessed and then referred to therapies and for other things he or she needs because of the effects of the disability, such as nappies and shoes, is looking at anything from 18 to 24 months.  It has not really changed.<\/p> <p>  When I was elected in 2011, one of the first issues raised with me involved the CHOs.  I would have referred to CHO 7 a lot.  This involved phenomenal early intervention waiting lists that children outgrew.  Many children were involved with St. John of God and other services.  The CDNTs were supposed to be the start of a change in how children were assessed and parents supported.  There was a lacuna for about three months for a lot of parents between the time when they lost their services at St. John of God, or whatever service provider they were with, and the time when they began to deal with the CDNTs.  Many parents reported to me and other Deputies that they did not find those initial CDNT assessments very helpful.  They were being referred to family supports, family forums and parents' support, all involving what parents can do to assist their children, rather than getting the direct service they needed such as speech and language therapy.<\/p> <p>  Professor MacLachlan said that the WHO has referred to it as a model that other countries should use.  Unless we have the staffing levels, we will not be able to resolve this issue in the CDNTs, in the community or in the schools.  There have been issues with therapists for the past 12 years.  I heard the witnesses say the HSE has an international recruitment campaign but I have seen recruitment campaigns for mental health nurses and nurses in general for the state of Victoria in Australia all around the city.  The whole world seems to be scrapping over staff to fill vacancies in these areas.  I am at a loss and perhaps the witnesses can direct me.  Why can we not have a drive in areas such as this?  I know therapists have a right to go wherever they choose after graduating but we must target these services and open up graduate courses so more people can go into these services.  We also need to keep them in the country through efforts in areas like wages and conditions.  I know that is not the witnesses' duty but there needs to be concentration on getting graduates into these services.  I do not want to sound very pessimistic but we are talking about funding for 830 to 850 vacancies yet we are talking about only being able to recruit 100 or 150 people for CDNTs.  In addition, there is pressure on other areas looking for the same therapists.  Do the witnesses think we should have a plan with targets and a focus on retention in respect of these services?  For families facing the prospect of waiting for 18 to 24 months, it is not a good place to be from the point of view of the children's supports.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#M00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I will comment on some of those questions and Professor MacLachlan on other parts.  We are working with our HR colleagues at the moment to progress a dedicated recruitment campaign for children's services.  That includes the points I was making earlier on the work with current panels, graduates and the international campaign and we have other measures that we are putting in place to incentivise staff to come and work in the children's services.  It is a priority area for the HSE to focus on.<\/p> <p>  A difficulty we have, and it is almost the perfect storm, is that there has been significant investment in the HSE in recent years and many aspects of service have been going to the same pool to draw on a similar profile of staff.  The system is not producing enough of the types of staff that we need.  Professor MacLachlan will have some direct experience of this.  We need to be producing more graduates in Ireland to meet our need.  We need more speech and language therapists and so on.  We need more programmes that allow people who have a primary degree in another area to do a short conversion programme that allows them to move into a therapy role and so on.  There is a range of measures that the college systems need to develop to meet the needs of the State.  Moreover, these are needs that are going to increase.  The capacity review report of disability services has a projection of what is needed over a decade.  If the level of funding identified in the capacity review report were to come over the next decade, we have an indication of the type of staffing that we need.  We need the system to produce those staff.  <\/p> <p> I am in no doubt of the commitment among my colleagues in the HSE, including in HR, that recruitment into the children's network teams is absolutely a priority area and one that we are working to encourage people to go to work in.  However, I say that while needing to acknowledge that we continue to compete with some other service areas that are also in urgent need of a similar profile of staff. <\/p> <p>  Will Professor MacLachlan comment on colleges? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Deputy Joan Collins said that there was not light at the end of the tunnel.  It is important to say that there definitely is light but the tunnel is way longer than we would like it to be.  I do not think she is at all confused about things.  She articulated how many interdependencies need to be addressed.  Unfortunately, it not one quick fix that will get us to where we want to be in a couple of years' time.  It will take longer than that.  Overall, at HSE level there is an initiative to look at third level and design new approaches to health sector training.  Specifically in the disability sector, for over a year the clinical programme has been advocating that there would be a particular initiative around health and social care professions, as Mr. O'Regan mentioned.  For instance, you can have graduate entry into occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  People can graduate fully in a two-year span on a graduate-entry masters degree.  That is a very short feed-in time in health.  Even investing in those professions would make a significant difference, as well as the other health and social care professions.  Importantly, when I was trained as a clinical psychologist I was trained to work almost independently whereas now we want people to come out ready to work in an interdisciplinary way, for instance, to work on children's disability network teams.  There needs to be a very specific initiative around disability.  We have been advocating for that in the HSE's overall approach to third level to make sure that there is a strong voice around disability.  It is crucial that we put out the message that there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel because if we talk down disability, it will become less attractive for people to come in here.  While we can in no way run away from the huge challenges we have, we need to create a virtuous circle that will attract more people to train and work in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I will begin with some brief questions and answers as we are under pressure for time.

We are in the midst of a fairly significant transformation of how disability services are provided and organised in Ireland.  There is a really good suite of policy to underpin the direction of travel throughout children's services, adult services, day services and so on, although there are probably some areas on which we need some further work from a policy perspective.  The transfer of functions, taking disability services out of the Department of Health and moving them into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, creates the potential for a whole-of-government approach to supports for disabled people, including children and adults who are autistic.  That is important because, at the moment, the HSE is looked at to be the provider of a lot of services that would be better provided elsewhere.  We provide transport services but we are not the Department of Transport, and we provide housing but we are not the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  A system can be expected to provide only so much and that can be stretched, but we now have an opportunity now to ask whether it would be better to have a whole-of-government approach and a whole-Department approach working collaboratively in the best interests of disabled people, older people or whomever we are focusing on.  That potential is certainly there and those kinds of things are critical in the type of reform and shifts that are needed in order that we will realise the potential of the convention and provide a community and collaborative model of supports that is not just reliant on conventional service delivery systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>On the personalised budgets, is there a set number that the HSE is taking?

We discussed similar issues then.  Unfortunately, I have not heard anything different today.  The issue of the CDNTs is raised with me continuously.  Is there someone in the HSE who leads on the progressing disability services programme?  None of our guests has that specific role in his or her title.  Does it not warrant something like that?<\/p> <p>  What measures are being taken to address the shortage of staff?  Our guests rightly mentioned an average shortage of 28%.  They stated that career progression within disability services is an obstacle.  The HSE has implemented the interim recommendation of the career pathway in primary care only.  Why has it not been introduced into disability services?  What other incentives to work in disability are being offered?  I understand that nurses, for example, are incentivised to work in ICUs and are given an additional payment for doing so.  Could something like that be looked at?<\/p> <p>  Turning to the inclusion of certain therapists on the critical skills list, I understand the HSE has let many staff into the system.  Our guests referred to a shortage of graduates within the various disciplines, and I presume they have informed the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  In a response to a recent parliamentary question, I was told by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that 15 additional graduate places were being made available in physiotherapy.  I hope I did not get the full answer and that that is not the sum total of the additional places being created.<\/p> <p>  Section 39 organisations provide services on the HSE's behalf.  There is a discrepancy in regard to pay and conditions.  Until that is addressed, we are going to continue to lose staff from section 39 organisation to other organisations.  I acknowledge that this might not be our guests' responsibility, but if the HSE is contracting these organisations, there has to be a level playing field if they are to work for children.  On the issue of putting services back into schools, there is a problem there because the therapists are being taken back into the CDNTs, which are already under-resourced.  I do not know how that is going to work.<\/p> <p>  On assessments of need, a High Court ruling in March found that the preliminary team assessment was not compliant with the Disability Act.  Has new guidance on assessment been circulated to the CDNTs since that?  Just yesterday, the parent of a five-year-old son who is non-verbal came to see me.  He had received an assessment in February and it was deemed to be compliant by the assessment of needs officer but, obviously, that has since changed.  I had a quick read of the assessment and it recommended that he be given a full autism assessment.  I do not think the original preliminary team assessments were addressing the backlog; rather, they were putting people onto more lists to get a proper assessment for autism or to access services, which they have not been able to access, given most people are coming to me telling me there is a two- to four-year waiting list.  If new guidance has issued, what timeframe are looking at to clear those lists?<\/p> <p>  Professor MacLachlan stated that a diagnosis to access education is not required but, unfortunately, because there are not enough special school settings, schools are insisting on the diagnosis because they want to prioritise those most in need.  Having a diagnosis also provides vital information to schools to help that child.<\/p><p>From being a teacher and a special educational needs, SEN, co-ordinator in the school, I know that getting information from the then child development team was vital.  It was so good, even in small recommendations on how to assist a child with autism to adapt to a new environment.  It made a considerable difference.  If the CDNTs are working with children and providing input to schools, that is important.<\/p><p> I have another case where a child who has been diagnosed with ASD and a mild learning difficulty also has a different, quite rare disease.  The two are not connected.  The child requires intense physiotherapy for the other disease.  They have been told that, in being able to access physiotherapy, the child should go on to primary care, but the child would then lose the supports of the CDNT for autism.  Can the two services not work together?  I was told by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, that the CDNTs and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, would start working together better.  I am sure the whole lot, primary care included, should be working together.<\/p><p> I have a number of other questions but I will leave them for the moment.  I will leave the officials to address those first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#O01400","speaker":"1513","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I will deal with some and Professor MacLachlan might comment on some as well.  In terms of the current structure of the leadership around the CDNTs, I am the head of operations.  In that sense, the implementation of the policy is within my remit.  I have a small team of people who support me in that.  We are currently looking at the structure around it and I do not know what the outcome of that will be.  I am very aware of the point implicit in the Deputy's question in terms of the importance of having someone dedicated there.

I do not have an answer to be able to specify the benefit but I will come back on that to the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  In relation to section 39 pay, that is an issue, not only in relation to our children services but across other service areas as well.  It is something that has been raised with Government.  The Deputy is correct that it is not something that is within our gift in the HSE to be able to resolve, but certainly it is something the impact of which we experience in terms of engaging with organisations that are really challenged in terms of their staffing.  In different parts of the country, that is having a significant impact.  It is certainly part of the suite of answers or solutions that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the options and incentives for staff, we have a number of measures we are finalising with HR both to recruit and retain staff.  We have invested, for example, and communicated in recent weeks a very significant commitment to staff training.  We are looking at sponsorship.  We are looking at different types of contractual arrangements that might allow some flexibility for people.  My HR colleagues might be raising concerns about some of these.  For example, we want to explore the option of somebody coming to work for four years but spreading his or her salary over five years so that he or she has an option of travel.  It costs the HSE four years' worth of salary for four years' worth of work but it gives somebody options in terms of, maybe, travelling with some income and the job security of having a post to come back to.

In fact, I raised this at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  That is something the Joint Committee on Disability Matters could look at because it relates to public sector employment agreements.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the assessment of needs, that guidance has been developed and signed off by the highest level clinical committee within the HSE.  We are obliged to go through the WRC process where we consult unions and make sure they are okay with it.  It is hoped that will be complete within the next few weeks.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the previous standard operating procedure.  We previously presented evidence that 84% of people who went through the preliminary routine assessment received some sort of intervention.  Some of them needed further assessment as well.  Essentially, that is gone now anyway because Ms Justice Siobh&aacute;n Phelan found it was not compliant with the Act.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what the Deputy says about diagnosis, we are not in any way against the diagnosis.  What we are saying is that it is not sufficient to identify a person's needs.  For example, in the UK, every year there are 5,000 people who are classified as SWAN, where SWAN stands for syndrome without a name.  If one was to require everyone to have a diagnosis to have access to services, those children would never have access to services.  More importantly, as the recent literature review I cited emphasises, sometimes an overemphasis on diagnosis can detract from the need to address people's needs and can sometimes misalign resources to diagnostic categories rather than to particular needs of children.  However, that is not in any way undermining the importance of diagnosis, both in terms of authenticating people's experience or giving them a sense of identity around their difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>If I may come back on one point, the examples of integrated services not being experienced in the examples the Deputy gave are not okay.

In general, however, residential services are covered by regulation and are inspected by HIQA.  There are requirements that those in residential services have access to appropriate multidisciplinary supports.  In a way, therefore, there is a legal structure in place to help to drive something.  There may be challenges in respect of availability, but I know that many providers of residential services try to source appropriate supports depending on the profile of the people in their services.  However, it should never be the case that somebody is on medications outside of proper supervision and review of those medications.  Also, the use of medication as an alternative to appropriate services is not acceptable anywhere.  I would be happy to follow up on that matter.<\/p> <p>  The definitions of home support - and this overlaps a little with definitions of PA services - are something we are working on.

Currently, if someone develops a severe mental health condition or, often, a moderate one, he or she needs to be referred out of services if he or she wants to receive medication.  We are trying to promote a model whereby there would be in-reach, for instance, by psychiatrists into a children's disability network team or an adult disability team.  The reason that is particularly important for people with autism is that sometimes they will have taken longer to build up familiarity and trust with the support team.  Members can imagine that if someone develops mental health problems, perhaps because of the frustrations of living with autism, and is then referred out of a team, it can often make his or her mental health condition much worse.  Furthermore, the teams to which people are referred are often not well resourced.  This also puts psychiatrists in very difficult circumstances in that they may often feel that the best intervention for someone with a severe mental health problem is not necessarily medication, but within their own teams they do not have other health and social care professionals.  I know for a fact that many psychiatrists are very concerned that they are having to prescribe medications in lieu of alternatives.  To me, this highlights the importance of having a model whereby we would have in-reach from psychiatry where medication is potentially beneficial.  That is probably, in my view, in the minority of cases, but it would be great if the committee could highlight that because we have a lot of service user participation in the service improvement programme for people with autism.  Within the protocol - and I have already described the independent evaluation for that - the consistent issue that is raised is the mental health of people with autism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>That concludes the contributions of members of the committee.

The witnesses have dealt with the biggest problem, that is, the fact that when it comes to speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, OTs and psychologists, we have nothing but vacancies.

We need a tiered approach.  Not every child needs 37 hours of assessment.  It helps us to get the most of out of a stressed system, but it is also the way we should be doing business.  We are piloting the tiered approach to ASD assessment in our area and getting good results.  We are only starting off in our implementation.  It is early days and we need more data, but the experience of doing it has been positive because we are using intervention as a form of assessment.  We are getting back to intervention first and using the information from that as a source of observation and diagnosis in some cases.  We have been surprised by how effective that has been in certain cases.  It is not for every child - some children need a more complex tier of assessment.  That is the direction in which we need to be going.  In terms of assessment of need, there is a legislative obligation that we cannot get out of, but if we are giving interventions within six months the number of assessment of need referrals drops off.<\/p><p>If we are using this tiered approach to get back to intervention first, based on obvious need rather than cumbersome assessment, we will be putting our resources in the right direction and clients will benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#R02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Higgins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>In your opening statement, you said that it is not acceptable for an individual with autism to have to wait an extended time for an assessment of needs or for supports or therapies and that is the crux of it.  As I said at a meeting with representatives of CHO 8 on Friday last, staffing levels within the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, are a disgrace.  We have heard evidence from families of having to pay up to &euro;1,800 for private assessments.  We have also heard stories of people getting assessments that are not being recognised.  It is not acceptable, to be quite honest.<\/p><p>I like the tiered model.  That is the way forward.  Having listened to the explanation of that model today, I have a better understanding of it and I believe it is the way to go.  There will be two more pilot areas, following on from the two that have already been done.  What CHO areas will those pilots take place in?  I will talk about my experience with the CDNT in Longford.  Last April we met the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte because there were more than 230 children waiting for an assessment of needs and more than 700 waiting for services.  Our team is now worse than it was at that time.  During the summer we had 3.8 whole time equivalents on the team.  There was no social worker, 0.8 in physiotherapy, 0.5 in speech and language therapy, one in occupational therapy and things were just getting worse.  <\/p><p>A number of members have raised the issue of third level education.  Who is responsible within the HSE for liaising with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science?  Whoever that is has not done his or her job because there is not a sufficient number of graduates coming through the third level system.  There are four colleges that run occupational therapy courses in the country, with around 90 professionals graduating every year.  Statisticians could figure out the number of those graduates that will go into the public system and the number that will go travelling, based on available data.  Somebody has not done his or her job.  The HSE has not engaged with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science across all of the services, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  The therapists are not there so somebody has failed.  Families and children have been failed because this work has not been done.  We have more than 700 vacancies because we do not have enough qualified people coming through the system.  As Deputy Casey said earlier, we should know the numbers and percentages.  We should know how many children are going to need services and we should have front-loaded courses at third level in order to have graduates coming through.  Whoever is responsible for that within the HSE has failed and that is why we are in this situation.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the Disability Act.  What engagement has the HSE had with the Government with regard to changing that legislation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>assessments and services?  This issue was highlighted a number of times today.  What engagement has taken place and is there resistance to making amendments to the Disability Act?  Reference was also made earlier to family engagement and I have read about autism support workers.  In my experience, it is the professionals who do the family engagement but while that is happening, services are not being provided for children.  The family engagement should be undertaken by non-professionals or by autism support workers.  They should be giving courses to parents.  I have seen that in my own local area, with professionals giving courses even though we have a massive shortage of such professionals and ultimately it results in fewer services being provided to children.<\/p><p>I invite our guests to comment further on the school inclusion model, which I believe is the way forward but I am a bit worried that there will be no HSE involvement in it.  Do I sense a conflict with regard to the school inclusion model?  As Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, taking children out of a setting in which they are comfortable, namely their school, and bringing them into a clinical setting, with parents having to take time off work, is not ideal.  I have seen the centre in my own local area and I made complaints about it when I first went into it.  It was not even properly painted and was not an appropriate setting for children.  The model involving the school, where they are comfortable, is better.  We have met the teachers' unions recently and discussed the fact that we need to change the training for teachers to enable them to work with children with autism.  We should also be training the SNAs to provide some elements of therapy on a daily basis but that must be backed up by professionals coming into the schools regularly.<\/p><p>Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan raised the issue of professionals in special schools.  Reference was made to 104 out of 136 special schools.  Why were only 104 schools picked, and not the full 136?  Is that a manpower issue?  There are lots of questions there and I invite Mr. O'Regan to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#S00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Thank you Chairman.  Please remind me if I miss anything.  Workforce planning is led by our human resources, HR, section but none of us here works in that area.  In fairness, what I would suggest is that HR would send a note to the committee.  As far as I know, they have made representations, although they may not be adequate.  Given that they are not here, I will ask that they send a briefing note to the committee on what has been done.  In that way the committee will at least be aware of what steps have been taken.<\/p> <p>  We have raised the issue of the Disability Act at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth previously.  The feedback we have received is that any review of that Act where the perception would be that it is being driven by an attempt by the HSE to wriggle out of its current legal responsibilities would be very challenging and contentious.  In fairness to ourselves, that is not what we are suggesting.  What we are suggesting is an enhancement of the Act so that it incorporates a right to services as well as a right to assessment and that will not make it easier for us.  In terms of the kinds of issues that we are already facing, having a legal requirement around them does not make it any easier to implement than where we are at today but it does equalise the importance of intervention and the assessment.  <\/p> <p>  The school inclusion model, on which Ms O'Kelly might want to comment further, was designed to focus on supporting a child to be able to access the curriculum.  That was its primary focus.  In some respects, it had quite a narrow orientation but we know that many children that we support have needs that go beyond, but also include, accessing the curriculum.  It is not the case that there is any tension between us or a row going on.  Rather, there is a debate to be had about the right direction in which to go.<\/p><p>Our view is having a model that takes account the child in all its environments is important and that includes access to the curriculum.  That does not take away from the potential for staff to work in special schools.  The 104 schools versus 136 is purely a function of an agreement with Government to address the change that those schools that had access to a service prior to reconfiguration would be addressed first.  I expect that at some point in time, Government will engage on the other schools.  To be honest, adding more today will not make it deliver any faster than we are able to go at the moment but the 104 is directly related to the schools that had access to services being delivered in the school prior to reconfiguration.  It was purely a function of that.  Again, I need to highlight that even since then the increased number of special classes and the number of children who are also accessing mainstream school has also continued to grow, even in the past number of years, and they are not included in that figure either.<\/p><p> I have probably missed some questions and I am sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I might add something on the school inclusion model if that is okay.  The Department of Education and the NCSE could answer this much better but a fundamental piece is their client in all this is the school and the school inclusion model.  The service user or client is the child and the family for the clinicians.  I agree with the Chairman that there should not be silos and separate streams.  We need an integrated programme for children, if you like, be that across services within the HSE and interagency ones between the Departments of Education and Health.  There is a universal level the school inclusion model looked at for building the capacity of teachers.  That could fit so well within the NCSE.  It has huge resources on CPD and education for our staff and for teachers.  If you thought of a child, you would think of bundles of care, so it is absolutely about inclusion in school and education, self-care in the home environment and building the capacity to be able to participate in their local community and transition.  Transitioning is huge for children.  Let us think of the move from the junior phase in senior infants up into first class, from fifth to sixth class and then from sixth class to first year and doing that work.  That is where bundles of care in the form of CDNTs providing transitional work come in. They assist with summer programmes for children to help them transition.  Reaching into the school with those bundles provides a much more enhanced experience for the child.

In some of our discussions we have spoken about an occupational therapy programme and therapists going in, or perhaps third- or fourth-year students in the colleges being employed for the summer to build up that relationship.

One of our big pieces was the hope the therapists who were employed on the school inclusion model would do the thing and work with their primary care and CDNT colleagues, so again to build that integration and robustness around the child.  Then knowledge is being brought to wherever the child is transitioning to next because that leap into secondary school and the leap into the senior cycle is so enormous for children.  I certainly am an advocate of that.  Various agencies have tried it.  The Central Remedial Clinic used to run summer camps.  The HSE, as I said, runs summer camps.  That is what we call them because it is normalised.  Kids are used to going to summer camp but it helps with the continuity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Does Professor MacLachlann have anything to add?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#T00500","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I might respond to a couple of questions.  The Chairman asked which CHOs were involved in the next phase.  Ms O'Kelly's organisation, CHO 7, is one of them and we are just finalising arrangements with CHO 4.<\/p> <p>  I agree with everything Mr. O'Regan said regarding the Disability Act.  It is also important to point out the Ombudsman has called for revision of the Act, as has the Disability Federation of Ireland.  The basic issue is it does not work for people with disabilities.  It was enacted in 2005, which means it was developed several years before then and, of course, the most significant legislation, that is, the UNCRPD, came into effect in 2006.  The Act predates that and in 2018 Ireland ratified the UNCRPD, which means we are obliged by international law to abide by it and the Disability Act does not allow us to.  It certainly is not a matter of the HSE running away from things, rather we it to be aligned to allow us to better deliver on services.  One of the ways of doing that is to ensure when we are revising the EPSEN Act, we are also revising an interlocking Act because especially around assessment of needs there are obligations from health services and education services and that has not been working.  This is a real opportunity to try to make it work.<\/p> <p>  On training, one of the things we have previously advocated for, especially with some of the new technological universities that have not been doing professional training in health and social professions, is that there be some exciting opportunities to establish new courses where people could all train together in an interdisciplinary way.  They could be located in geographical areas where it is perhaps more difficult to retain staff, because all the research evidence shows that when people are trained in particular locations, especially rural areas, they are much more likely to stay in those areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022101800002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I have one more thing to mention before I let Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in.

The reduced public transport fares announced previously are to be extended to the end of 2023 and a number of measures have been put in place to help eligible students with academic fees.<\/p><p> In light of the continued increase in household energy bills, the Government has decided to support domestic customers further through a second electricity benefit scheme for this winter.  The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Act 2022 provided for the electricity credit to be made under the scheme on a once-off basis in 2022.  Therefore, new legislation was required for this scheme to be established.  The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, which provides the legal basis for the new scheme, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 13 October and was signed by the President into law.  The new scheme will be closely modelled on the previous one and an electricity costs emergency benefit payment of &euro;200, including VAT, for an estimated 2.2 million domestic accounts is to be paid in each of the November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023 electricity billing cycles, totalling &euro;600, including VAT, per domestic electricity account.  This scheme will have a ceiling of &euro;1.211 billion and within this, a contingency has been included to ensure there is no shortfall to cover the increase in any new domestic customers during the period of the scheme.  The scheme will be operated by ESB Networks which will make payments to the individual energy supplies.  Those suppliers will, in turn, credit individual domestic electricity accounts.  The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will be charged with oversight of the scheme.<\/p><p> A further &euro;1 million will be allocated for those domestic customers whose households many not have an individual meter point reference number, MPRN.  Upon completion of the previous electricity credit scheme, the need to have an MPRN resulted in certain cohorts not being able to access the payment.  A particular cohort since identified includes some Traveller families in certain local authority accommodations where the MPRN is registered to the local authority and supplies multiple households.  Work is under way to establish an alternative mechanism to ensure the payment reaches these Traveller families.<\/p><p> VAT must be applied on the electricity bill balance after the credit has been applied.  On that basis, the credit of &euro;183.49 is being applied exclusive of VAT on each account.  Inclusive of VAT, the total reduction on each household electricity bill will be &euro;200.<\/p><p> Earlier this year, the CRU directed EirGrid, the transmission system operator, to procure some 450 MW of additional temporary generation capacity for winter 2023-24 through to winter 2025-26 to offset a potential capacity shortfall of electricity supply.  The temporary generation capacity may be extended to winter 2026-27, if necessary.  To comply with this direction, EirGrid requires financial support from the Exchequer.  Legislation to ensure EirGrid can carry out this direction, including the legal basis for my Department providing the necessary financial support, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas in July of this year and was signed into law by the President.<\/p><p> The level of financial support required in 2022 to allow EirGrid place orders on the electricity generation units and to ensure they are delivered and installed in time for winter 2023-24 was estimated at &euro;350 million.  As the final level of financial support required in 2022 was not known earlier this year as the contractual arrangements were still at an early stage at that time, it was agreed that approval of the allocation of funding for the emergency generation capacity would be requested in two tranches.  A previous allocation request of &euro;200 million was granted in July with the indicative funding request for the initial stages of the project, with a further request forecasted to be required in the autumn of &euro;150 million when the contractual details were close to finalisation.  These contracts are now ready to be finalised subject to final terms being agreed and the balance of funding being available.  The &euro;150 million balance of funding represents the final agreed figures required by EirGrid for the purchase of the generation equipment and balance of the plant this year.<\/p><p> The total cost of the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme is, as I said, estimated at &euro;1.212 billion and the balance of funding for the emergency power generation scheme is &euro;150 million.  As the additional funding of &euro;1.362 billion required is being provided from the Exchequer, the main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to allocate &euro;1.212 billion to subhead B11 and &euro;150 million to subhead B13 in the energy transformation programme area to fund the two measures.<\/p><p> In addition to the approval for the Exchequer funding for the two schemes, I am also seeking approval to reallocate &euro;7 million within subheads in my Vote to provide for expenditure for a number of other measures.<\/p><p> Local authorities have a particularly important role in the delivery of both climate mitigation and adaptation.  This is reflected in the provisions of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, which requires each local authority to prepare a local authority climate action plan, specifying the mitigation and the adaptation measures to be adopted by the local authority.  These plans will be updated once every five years.  The first of these plans is due to be submitted by each local authority by the end of 2023.  This funding will allow the Department to establish a governance structure with local authorities for the development and reporting of these climate actions plans.  I am seeking approval to provide funding of &euro;3.5 million in 2022 through the allocation of savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership programme area.<\/p><p> My Department has secured support from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, for a climate-specific round of the sound and vision scheme to address the need to fund programming specific to the climate crisis.  This programming will contribute to an important component of delivering on the national dialogue&rsquo;s objective of improving climate literacy.  Improving climate literacy will enhance the capacity of people to make small changes in their daily lives, engage with climate action at a local level in their communities and at national level in the co-design of policy.  Through the expertise of the BAI and the vision of Ireland&rsquo;s programme makers, we will ensure the delivery of a range of innovative and creative programming to bring climate awareness, literacy and empowerment into homes across the country.  To facilitate this, I am seeking approval to provide funding of &euro;2.5 million in 2022 through allocating savings identified within the climate action and environment leadership programme area.<\/p><p> The national energy security framework published earlier this year places a significant emphasis on the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy to underpin Ireland's security of supply.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the planning system is fully supportive of the roll-out of renewables, something first expressed in action No. 102 of the climate action plan 2021.<\/p><p> As part of its ongoing effort to improve the delivery of its service, An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently provided the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with a specific resource plan for the area of maritime development and climate action, including the establishment of the marine and climate directorate.  The total funding requirement for the establishment of the new functions is expected to be in the region of &euro;3.5 million and my Department is committing to provide &euro;1 million in once-off funding in 2022 to support the set-up of this function.  I am seeking approval to provide this contribution under subhead B6, other energy programmes (national and international), in 2022 through allocating savings identified in subhead C3, mining and petroleum services.<\/p><p> I am happy to take questions from the committee on any aspect of this Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#A00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

This question could probably extend to the funding for An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well.  The local authorities, in a broad level, are responsible for a lot of climate action through transport and housing.  Decisions that local authorities take have an impact on housing and transport emissions.  However, a narrower view is to look at the operational side of a local authority.  Do the local authorities take a broader or narrower view in their climate action plans?  It is one thing for all public buildings in a local authority area to have low energy lighting, but there is a bigger impact of the local authorities in terms of climate.

I have been travelling around the country as best as I can talking to different local authorities to encourage them in that work and listening to what they have to say on the resources they need.  This is a response.  I also told them that they should take broad perspective as to what their role is; it is not just about how they manage their own energy use within their buildings, fleets and so on.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of wider considerations.  One of the areas where we have huge potential for decarbonisation development and improving our citizens&rsquo; lot is through the development of the likes of district heating.  It can only be the local authority, particularly through its development process, that can look to target and identify, and then facilitate, support and, in many instances, manage the roll-out of such systems.  That then can be applied across a wide variety of different areas, including transport and energy.  It can be applied not only in district heating but also in improvement of their housing stock and the provisions within the development plan around renewable power generation and grid development.  Once one starts looking at it, the list of where local authorities can and should have a key role is significant.<\/p> <p>  That is connected, in a sense, to the economic development role of local authorities.  This is where a new economy and opportunities will develop.  Those councils and authorities that are ahead of the curve in being part of the decarbonisation programme will see more investment, more jobs and a wider rate base.  To answer the Chair&rsquo;s question, their function should not be seen narrowly as being about the emissions that they are directly responsible for, but rather in that wider remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that.

I thank the Minister for coming.  I congratulate him on the measures that he brought in in the budget, which the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, confirmed will protect the estimated 29% who at risk of energy poverty.  They are very welcome.  It is over the winter period and we need to revisit some of these things.  I welcome the new measures the Minister is announcing.  will come back to them.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  In respect of the energy credit going to householders, has the Minister at this stage been able to estimate how much we might recoup from the EU measures that are now in the offing?  That is, the capping of the price of electricity for the non-gas providers and the solidarity tax on the fossil fuel, and perhaps the longer-term market reform that is coming.<\/p> <p>  On the emergency temporary provision, how is the state aid being structured?  Is this a price commitment in terms of supporting the price that would be paid a capital allocation?  It will be there for just four winters at most, although this sort of equipment, presumably, has a 20-year life span or something of that nature.  What happens after that?  It seems that it would be very expensive and wasteful to take it out of the Irish system.  How is that going to happen?<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister have line of sight on the features that stalled the last auction &ndash; things such as planning, availability of equipment and compliance with environmental requirements?  Do we have clear line of sight to the effect that none of those things will obstruct this?<\/p> <p>  My final questions are on the sound and vision initiative.  As the Minister knows, I am strongly advocating for a resilience campaign around our reliance on imports.  I would like to hear that is going beyond just talking about climate and looking at the practical things that can be done.<\/p> <p>  In the context of local authority planning, no local authority, to my knowledge, has yet put in place a public electric vehicle charger with the grant that the Government makes available to them.  I know that has been changed.  However, it suggests there is a bit of a disconnect between the emergency that people are facing and the attitude of local authorities.  Can the Minister bring a little urgency into this, along with the allocation of the extra money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The amount of money raised from the measures that we have agreed at European Council, such as the inframarginal pricing and the solidarity contribution of fossil fuels, is hard to estimate exactly because it depends on so many different variables &ndash; the price of gas and, as a consequence, wholesale electricity prices.  The good news is that while they are still historically incredibly high prices, it is a fraction now of what the prices were two or three months ago.  The reduction is welcome, however, it still leaves us in a difficult situation.  It would also depend, to a certain extent, on the timelines that supply whether the measures are extended beyond original provisions and also the rates and levels that apply.  The European Union is recommending that it is beyond &euro;180 per MWh that inframarginal pricing would kick in and this windfall would be gained.  However, we have the capability of lowering that and that is something we are looking at.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, on the contribution, the European Commission is recommending 35%, or setting that as within the terms, but recognising that it could go higher.  As I said, there is work ongoing with the Department of Finance and my Department to get the details on this.  We have to have it in place before the end of the year.  We want the revenue in quickly.<\/p> <p>  I expect the inframarginal revenue to go towards reducing electricity bills directly.  That would be the best use of it.  The solidarity contribution may be useful in the context of wider supports.  We are looking at including business supports and so on.  As already stated, I estimate that it will be between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion, but we will have more specifics on that in the coming weeks when we agree the final details, the timelines and so on.<\/p><p>With regard to the emergency purchasing of aeroderivative jet engines, I thank the Chair and the committee for their involvement.  The timeline and speed of progressing the legislation, along with the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny for aspects of this, which we have had to do, has been extraordinary.  It is unfortunate and we would prefer not to be in this situation.  We are doing it to make sure that we have sufficient power supply next winter.  The provisions came from the CRU asking that EirGrid would purchase the equipment.  We are supporting that.  It is the last resort.  The timeline potentially goes to the winter of 2026-27, as I said in my opening remarks.  The expectation is that the generators deploying them would have to sell on the relevant equipment.  In my mind, we can probably recoup revenue to recover some of these costs.  We have not provided for this because it is an unknown.  I expect there will be a significant return to Revenue when that is done, and then, as the Deputy said, that equipment can then be used in a range of other operations.  My expectation and preference is that it will be used on the island of Ireland because we will need fast-reacting open-cycle distillate, gas-fired or hydrogen-fired backup generation, which is what the equipment that we will contract in the coming days or weeks will provide.  We are not providing for it in the Estimates because it is an unknown, but I expect there will be a significant return to the State at the end of this emergency process, when it is unwound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#C00600","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

I have a couple of quick questions.  The first relates to an issue he touched on.  How will those without a meter point reference number, MPRN, get their electricity grant?  It seems from reading his submission that he has not quite figured out how that will be dispensed.  Will he comment on whether that will definitely go to the Traveller community, which did not get to avail of it last time, and how that will be done?  I will raise another matter again, which is a hot political topic at the moment.  How will the Minister guarantee that there are no disconnections of those with prepaid meters or those with hefty bills from district heating systems, where much higher tariffs apply?<\/p> <p>  The main question that I want to ask is about the emergency generation plans and the &euro;350 million that is being voted.  Some &euro;200 million has been spent and there is &euro;150 million for the autumn.  That is all done and dusted.  It is necessary, but it bothers me that there is no scrutiny of why it is necessary.  We need to revisit that.  The Minister is looking far into the future to 2026, 2027 and 2028, when we may still require this type of plant, yet the State is continuing to connect data centres to the grid when we know that they are soaking up increasingly large volumes of energy.  Should we not, at some point, stop scrambling to purchase extra equipment but instead stop the connection of extra data centres when we know that they are the cause of the increase in our energy use?  The Minister mentioned the war in Ukraine, but the data centre issue is extraneous to that and we have information from the CRU that shows our electricity demand has grown by 9% over the past five years compared with 27 EU countries, which have approximately 0% growth in their energy demand.  Ours is continually growing, which is clearly because of the growth of the data centre industry here.<\/p> <p>  My last question is about climate research.  Why do we have money back from climate research?  Why did we not spend the funding when we know from the biodiversity report that there is little hard evidence on the decline of many species in this country and that we should research that and spend the funding to examine how and why this is happening so that we can try to redress the problem and protect endangered species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#D00400","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I confirm that we will make sure that Traveller families will get the cash payments that 99.5% or 99.6% of households got in the first tranche.  We know that it works.  Where there were anomalies or communities were left out, such as certain families within the Traveller community, we will work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and with local authorities to make sure that they get the payment this autumn just like every other household.<\/p> <p>  Disconnections are a critical issue.  We recognise that it may be a difficult period for a variety of different customers, whether they are on bill pay schemes or not.  Many families with pay-as-you-go services find that it is a useful mechanism.  We should be careful not to depict all the problems as being in just one sector.  Many people with bill pay services also have difficulties and we have to protect them.  The mechanisms to help families on pay-as-you-go services first and foremost involve having a good, close relationship with the supplier and the application of the support mechanisms that it has in place to ensure that households do not have to disconnect themselves in a way that they do not want to.  CRU has developed a range of other measures, including the right to access lower tariffs.  One measure that we will look at from our energy poverty action plan, which will be published in the next few weeks, is a review of gas connections as well as electricity to see if there are measures to take there to improve people's situations, particularly the relatively small number of but still important households which have hardship meters.  How do we get better provisions for them?  We have not finished introducing measures to help those households.  We will continue to review and to make sure that the State helps them through what will be a difficult winter period.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why we need to switch off the scheme and why we would not keep generators running in 2028 and 2029.  This is an emergency measure.  It is not the only measure in place.  We also have the T-4 and T-3 auctions.  The majority of the 2 GW of backup gas-fired power will come through those auction processes.  We need a significant investment, which we are now seeing, in battery storage and additional renewables, through the renewable energy strategy.  That is working and it is delivering.  The volume of power from renewable power generation has never been as significant as this year.

Often people may be outside the social welfare system and in various circumstances, and I think it is appropriate they get a payment during these difficult times.  Once we start to do that, then, do we agree to undertake provisions through electricity bills?  I ask this because it would not be possible to do it through gas payments, because only 42% of households have gas connections, or any other mechanism.  It was appropriate to take this approach.<\/p> <p>  The cost to start differentiating, the time delay and the bureaucratic complications involved in trying to change the entire database system, or to try to manipulate it to categorise payments based on income or on whether it is a first or second home, would not have delivered the credit in time.

The payment next month, on 1 November, will come just at the right time.

This strategy was submitted to us last year.  The authors worked out and identified the supports in this regard.  This Supplementary Estimate is now responding to that endeavour.  It has taken the analysis provided to us regarding what capacity requirements local authorities have and has suggested ways of funding it.  This approach encompasses all 31 local authorities delivering phase 1.

We need to change that.<\/p> <p>  The issue of prepay meters is complex.  There are different circumstances for gas and electricity.  Different types of meters are involved.  There are also different types of customers.  Many people are using prepay meters because it provides a very useful service.  It is a very attractive way to manage paying and for many people reducing energy use and their bills.  The complexity of that is that a number of different companies are involved.  Not every company uses prepay meters but those that do have a variety of tariffs, often better and innovative tariffs to support customers.  The standing charge and the per-use charge vary because suppliers try to attract customers with that.  There is an issue with those who are in difficulty.  We need to address that and the CRU has done a lot of work already.<\/p> <p>  Included in that is the requirement to ensure that those who are in difficulty are not paying the highest charges.  As we go through this winter, we will try to ensure that the discounted tariffs are made available to those most in need of them as well as other supports.  In two weeks' time we will publish an energy action plan which will outline further measures that we may seek to deliver in conjunction with the CRU.  We are doing considerable work monitoring the consumer protection measures.  We will not rest with whatever is there.  It means looking at it and ensuring we adjust if people are left in difficulties.  We do not want anyone disconnected this summer, least of all those at risk of fuel poverty who do not have the heat and the power that they need.<\/p> <p>  Officials from my Department are meeting both suppliers and the NGOs to understand the issues on the ground.  The CRU is working with the NGO representative group to ensure we apply the best solutions here.  There is no lack of commitment to getting households through a difficult winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022101800002#G00900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I return to the issue of capping, solidarity and so on.

It is clear that the solidarity contribution will only in effect really apply to one company, the Corrib gas field.  With inframarginal it is complex because there are generating companies, such as wind farms, but they may have sold on power through a long-term contract at low rates to a supplier company or supplier-like company.  We are saying we will not just apply inframarginal pricing to the generating companies, but we will also apply it to those suppliers and supplier-like companies if they are gaining a windfall profit from these very high market prices for fossil fuel and gas.<\/p><p>Then one is into the complexity of each different generator in terms of what its arrangements are.  However, there are many companies which may be purchasing that power and passing on the windfall gain to consumers by reducing their overall bills.

The exact amount will only become more clear when we understand how much of those long-term contracts are in place and now much of the savings have been passed on to consumers.

We also joined by representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, Mr. David Joyce, equality officer, and Ms Mandy La Combre, senior industrial relations officer of the Financial Services Union.  From NUI Galway, we have Dr. Nata Duvvury, director at the Centre for Global Women's Studies.  I welcome our witnesses and thank them for attending.  We invited representatives of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC.  However, due to other diary commitments, they were not in a position to attend.<\/p> <p>  I remind those joining us remotely that the chat function on MS Teams should only be used to make the team on-site aware of any technical issues or urgent matters that may arise and should not be used to make general comments or statements during the meeting.  I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to that constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.<\/p> <p>  In advance of inviting witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I wish to advise them of the following in regard to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses who are participating from the committee room are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses who are appearing virtually before the committee, there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege applies to their evidence if given outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if directed by me to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting will comprise three opening statements.  Each witness has five minutes and we ask witnesses to adhere to that timeframe in as far as possible.  We will start with Ms Baxter, followed by Mr. Joyce and Dr. Duvvury.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#A00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Apologies, Chair, my colleague Ms Jane Ann Duffy is giving the opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Baxter"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>That is no problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#A00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth holds responsibility for the development of policy and legislative proposals on family leaves.  As the committee will be aware, family leaves have undergone significant expansion in recent years.  Since 2019, this has included the introduction of paid parent&rsquo;s leave and its extension to seven weeks for each parent of a child under two years of age and the extension of unpaid parental leave to 26 weeks in respect of a child under 12 years of age.<\/p> <p>  The Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 includes provisions for leave for medical care purposes and the extension of breastfeeding breaks.  The Government has decided to bring forward, as part of that Bill, legislative proposals which will introduce domestic violence leave.  These proposals are based on recommendations made as part of the domestic violence leave report.<\/p><p>The programme for Government contains a number of commitments aimed at addressing domestic violence leave, including the commitment to investigate \"the provision of paid leave and social protection provision to victims of domestic violence.\"  In response to this Private Members' Bill, the Government agreed to examine the feasibility of establishing a statutory entitlement to paid domestic violence leave and to provide a report.  Work on the development of the domestic violence leave report began with a consultation process with relevant stakeholders, in particular service providers and victims' representative groups, through the monitoring committee of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  This consultation had the aim of gathering their views on how best domestic violence leave should operate to address the needs of victims most effectively.<\/p><p> Consultations also took place with social partners, including employer representative groups and trade unions, to get a better understanding of the needs of employers and employees in terms of introducing such leave.  These consultations explored the current approach taken by businesses to support employees experiencing domestic violence, including where there were existing domestic violence workplace policies in operation and lessons from how those operated.  Submissions were also invited through the national equality strategies and other stakeholders who represented minority and other seldom heard voices, including the national strategy for women and girls, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, the national LGBTI+ inclusion strategy, and the migrant integration strategy.  Alongside these consultations, research was undertaken into the international experience around the introduction of domestic violence leave.  A number of countries have some form of leave for this purpose, both paid and unpaid and with different criteria.<\/p><p> The outcome of the consultations and research informed the development of the recommendations in the domestic violence leave report.  Some key considerations were the need for the leave not to operate independently of other supports, that it should be part of a broader workplace awareness and openness around domestic violence, and that it should be available as flexibly as possible, to be taken when and as needed, with no notice period required.<\/p><p> The report's first recommendation focuses on the need for a broader approach to help victims, but also to help managers understand how best they can support an employee who is a victim.  The Department is tendering for a partner who will help us to develop templates and guidance for employers of all sizes.  The report also recommends that five days of paid domestic violence leave be introduced, to be taken within a 12-month period, with a provision that this measure be reviewed within two years of introduction with the option to extend to ten days.  In order to facilitate uptake as needed, it also recommends that no notice period be required.  Further recommendations include that the leave should be available for a range of purposes, including relocation or to seek legal or other supports, and that employment protections should apply.<\/p><p> Committee Stage amendments to the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 are being finalised.  These will be based on the detail of the recommendations that I have outlined.<\/p><p> I thank members for the invitation to meet the committee today.  I am happy to answer whatever questions they may have on the development of the domestic violence leave report or on the legislative proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Ann Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Duffy.

Congress endorses the introduction of paid domestic violence leave as a vital support for survivors.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Mandy La Combre, who will also participate in our discussion.<\/p> <p>  Economic independence from an abusive partner is essential for women experiencing domestic abuse and employment can play an important role in supporting abused women in remaining financially independent.  Therefore, we warmly welcome the Bill.  Indeed, we have engaged with Deputy O'Reilly on its contents.  We also note the recent publication by the Government of the domestic violence leave report, which includes recommendations on how best to support employees experiencing domestic abuse.  I will refer to this in our brief opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  Domestic violence leave has been a priority for the trade union movement, not only here in Ireland but internationally, as evidenced by the negotiation of International Labour Organization, ILO, convention No. 190 on violence and harassment in the world of work and its accompanying recommendation No. 206, which gives further, more detailed guidance on how the convention should be implemented at national level.  One of the most important elements of the convention is that it deals with the issue of domestic violence.  This was a key demand of trade unions.  The convention recognises that domestic violence can impact the world of work - it can affect employment, productivity and health and safety - and that the world of work can be a key point of intervention in mitigating or reducing the impacts of domestic violence.  The convention requires governments to take appropriate measures to recognise the effects of domestic violence and, so far as is reasonably practicable, mitigate its impact in the world of work.<\/p> <p>  The Bill and the recent announcement by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, are in line with the spirit of the convention and recommendation No. 206, which specifies a range of measures to mitigate the impacts of domestic violence in the world of work, including leave for victims of domestic violence; flexible work arrangements and protection for victims of domestic violence; and the inclusion of domestic violence in workplace risk assessments.  We welcome the Government's stated intention to ratify this important convention before the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  While welcoming these moves, congress has from the beginning made our position clear on some of the major issues involved.  We believe that the leave should be a minimum of ten days per rolling 12-month period, which is stipulated in the Bill.  This should not be reduced to five.  In certain cases, ten days may not be enough and additional unpaid leave may be necessary.  We also recommend consideration of a process for additional leave to cover exceptional circumstances.  Ideally, this should be paid leave but, at a minimum, it should be some unpaid leave provision that could work similarly to maternity leave provisions.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of proof, for domestic violence leave to be successful, there should be as few barriers as possible to taking the leave.  Survivors already face an overwhelming number of barriers when reporting or disclosing violence, including sociocultural attitudes and stigma, sexual assault myths and personal repercussions.  Requiring proof for this type of leave reinforces the all-too-common perception that individuals reporting violence are somehow not credible or trustworthy.  Given the stigma that abuse carries and the fact that it is vastly under-reported, there is little reason to believe that any such leave would be widely misused.  In fact, research suggests the opposite.  In Australia, interviews with employers who had had leave in place for several years through enterprise agreements found that the leave was infrequently used even where employers had actively promoted its provision.  Furthermore, since violence thrives in secrecy, there will in many cases be no external way for a service provider to confirm that domestic or sexual violence has occurred.<\/p> <p>  Regarding workplace agreements, economic insecurity is one of the greatest factors inhibiting victims of domestic violence from escaping violent situations at home.  To address this problem, unions and employers have developed paid domestic violence leave provisions that allow victims to attend legal proceedings, medical appointments or other events or activities related to the violence they have experienced without risk of lost income or employment.  Congress believes that paid leave should be part of a broader domestic violence and work policy that would also support survivors in other ways.  My colleague, Ms La Combre, will be happy to discuss what a workplace policy should cover.  Her union, along with SIPTU, the Communication Workers' Union, CWU, and others, has been leading the way in this regard.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of costs, claims that the introduction of such leave might somehow undermine our competitiveness are simply not credible.  An Australian study, entitled Economic Aspects of Paid Domestic Violence Leave Provisions, considered the likely impact of domestic violence leave on the payroll costs of employers and found that incremental payments to workers taking the leave would amount to one fiftieth of 1% - 0.02% - of current payrolls.  The report argued that this argument misunderstood the nature of competitiveness in a modern, innovation-driven economy.  Cementing a reputation as a safe, high-quality and inclusive place to live would be beneficial to national competitiveness, and paid leave for victims of domestic violence would be an important symbol of Ireland's commitment in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to submit our views on this important legislation.  We are happy to respond to whatever questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Joyce.

The Bill is a significant milestone, advancing gender equality in Ireland.  It must be appreciated that the Bill is evidence-based legislation.<\/p><p>It is based on undeniable scientific evidence of the enormous human and financial costs of domestic violence and coercive control to individuals, families, employers, communities and the State.  A recent Safe Ireland and University of Galway study estimated that the annual indicative cost of domestic violence for survivors is about &euro;2.7 billion annually, or the equivalent of &euro;56 billion over a 20-year period, based on the women who we interviewed.  This level of loss is not surprising, given that a KPMG study of Vodafone employees found that 151,000 women employed in Ireland, or about 6% of the workforce, have had a lifetime experience of domestic violence, with 65% saying that domestic violence seriously or considerably affected their career progression, which leads to wage loss and productivity loss.  These social and economic losses have significant macroeconomic implications which could potentially affect overall economic growth and the sustainability of the Irish economy.  In the context of the current housing and cost-of-living crises, the repercussions take on an even greater salience.  Domestic violence represents leakage from the economic system that needs to be stopped.  This Bill goes one step towards that.<\/p><p> The proposed Bill is ground-breaking in its clear recognition that domestic violence is not a private family matter, but rather a public concern which has serious consequences across society, including in the workplace.  Recognition of the collective effort needed by all stakeholders to prevent domestic violence, as well as to mitigate its consequences, is required.  It is particularly important that the Bill is being introduced as part of the organisation of working time legislation.  It places domestic violence as a central economic issue as well as a human rights violation.  The proposed Bill marks a critical juncture in our recognition of the workplace as an important site of safety for women.  If the legislation is passed, Ireland would join a handful of countries globally which have domestic violence legislation.  It is important, therefore, to seriously consider the Bill and pass it.<\/p><p> When we consider legislation, we also need to understand whether there are issues that could affect the effectiveness of the proposed Bill.  We need to consider the universality of the application of the law.  While there is no reference to the size of the enterprise, there is concern about the extent to which this law would apply to small entrepreneurs hiring only one or two employees, or employees without contracts, such as volunteers or other informal workers.  When considering domestic violence, it is important to understand that domestic employment or employment in a family enterprise puts more women at risk of experiencing domestic violence.  These employees are outside the ambit of the Organisation of Working Time Act, so there should be special consideration for them.  This applies equally to whether this legislation will be relevant to gig economy workers, who are often mischaracterised as self-employed independent contractors.  Those who experience domestic violence are the least likely to be able to fight against this mischaracterisation.  We need to consider the impact of this law for gig workers.<\/p><p> The review of legislation across the world has shown that the effectiveness of the law can be limited by the lack of proactive will among employers.  Positive obligations have to be placed on employers to implement the law.  This is done in New Zealand, where there is a financial penalty if the employer does not implement a domestic violence policy or domestic violence leave.  There should be some limitations on employers&rsquo; rights to refuse domestic violence leave.  A significant issue that has been highlighted is that there is sometimes, given that this is between employer and employee, a deference to employers in legislation and to their right to discipline their workforce and fire unproductive employees.  This is not the case for women who are experiencing domestic violence.  There should be adequate consideration of the obligations being placed on employers.<\/p><p> Leave by itself is insufficient.  There have to be other reasonable accommodations.  As ILO convention No. 190 points out, these accommodations include flexible working time, financial support, supervisory support to manage work performance, support to seek protection orders, and clear safety measures to maintain confidentiality and privacy.<\/p><p> The terminology in the legislation needs to be clearer, particularly with regard to coercive control.  No clear definition of coercive control is given.  It is a new concept and it is not well understood by policymakers or even by those women who experience coercive control.  There is a lack of a definition of what constitutes serious alarm or distress.  This is particularly important because women experiencing violence tend to minimise the effects of domestic violence.  We must flesh out this term.<\/p><p> There is no focus on the perpetrator or abuser.  This is important.  As long as domestic violence leave policies only focus on the person experiencing the domestic violence, it indicates that the victim is responsible for addressing domestic violence.  We need to bring the perpetrator into the picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nata Duvvury","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Duvvury.

I have been negotiating workplace policies around domestic violence for some time within my union.  In our sector, no employer we have dealt with is seeking proof.  We already know the statistics that one in four women in the Republic of Ireland suffers domestic abuse and fewer than one in three actually reports it.  We know even fewer report it when it comes to the workplace.  The idea that we are putting more barriers in place such as seeking proof is, from a trade union perspective, a total non-runner, to be honest.  We are not supportive of that and we do not believe that if people have to do it they will come forward.  We are talking about emergency situations and, as my colleague, Mr. Joyce, said, how people can prove things like coercive control and stuff like that.  The proof issue is a dodgy area to be getting into and an extra barrier to put in place for people.<\/p> <p>  In terms of five versus ten days' leave, we have workplace policies which have ten days' leave.  It is a floor rather than a ceiling in the policies we have negotiated already.  Employers have told us they do not want to reduce the number of days or never sought to look for fewer days.  In the review process of policies they are not saying there is something that they want to reduce.  The ten-day period is very necessary when we see the kind of things people need that leave for.  Employment is sometimes the only safe space for somebody who is suffering domestic violence.  People might need that leave for childcare, to meet agencies or for court hearings or meetings with garda&iacute;.  This is the time that those who are suffering abuse are hidden from their abuser and can access services.  The number of days leave is very important and five is too few.  Proof is not adequate.  <\/p> <p>  On the privacy issue, I am a trade union official and a trained HR professional.  I do not believe there should be anybody working in any employment or HR department who is not empathetic or does not have the ability to hold something confidential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mandy La Combre"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>In the University of Galway, we have for the first time introduced a domestic violence leave policy.  We developed the policy after a review of the experience across different countries.  One of the first things we noticed is that ten days has become the international norm as a minimum, recognising that for some women it might be more.  There has to be flexibility with an employer to figure out what the amount of leave should be.  A period of ten days' leave is now becoming the universal standard.<\/p> <p>  It is also becoming standard that proof is extremely difficult to provide in this context and that employers undermine the effectiveness of legislation by even talking about a requirement to provide proof.  In the University of Galway policy, we have no requirement for proof.  We have also made possible that if a woman goes to an external agency for support the agency can contact HR in the University of Galway and say it thinks the person may need to avail of the leave.  HR can then be more proactive.  We have a trained person in HR who will work with women and has been trained in confidentiality and maintaining privacy.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, employers across the world are beginning to recognise that domestic violence is a serious workplace issue because it has significant consequences for productivity.  It is not just about women taking leave.  If women are less present, there is presenteeism and they are less productive while being at work, the purpose of any kind of profit-making business is defeated.  Employers are recognising this has significant implications for their reputation.  It is part of the movement towards corporate social responsibility.

The introduction of such leave enables a range of purposes to be achieved in terms of going to court, medical appointments and so on.<\/p> <p>  The reason we are talking about a review is that it is very hard to know at this stage how much leave somebody will need.

What will be done to help them to understand this is something they can do, that it is non-prejudicial and safe to do and that they will be okay?  From the employers point of view, will there be an onus on them to upskill their staff?

Is there a body or an organisation that can upskill staff?  What is the best way to do this?

My own research into discrimination and sexual violence in our armed forces is over 20 years old and as Dr. Duvvury said, we have the knowledge.  We know this.  In that research from 20 years ago, what struck me was that one in four of the female personnel that I interviewed experienced some form of serious sexual assault, up to and including rape.  As an academic I have been involved with the expert advisory group for the Higher Education Authority on ending sexual violence and harassment on our university campuses and that figure comes up again.  One in four of our students at third level can expect to experience sexual violence and harassment while on campus, in a place of safety, in a learning environment.  <\/p> <p>  Ms La Combre said that one in four people experiences domestic violence.  The majority are female but some men also experience it.  We have heard some really interesting contributions from LGBTIQ and gay men's groups who talked about the additional stigma and barriers to reporting for men.  It is absolutely clear, as Dr. Duvvury said, that we have the knowledge.  We have a crisis.  This affects one in four in this room, outside waiting to go into the other committee rooms and in these Houses of the Oireachtas.  Those of us in Ireland who have experienced or witnessed domestic violence in the home or in our relatives' homes know that this is a crisis.  There is a dynamic at play in Irish society and culture.  The language for it is extensive.  We have a very extensive vocabulary for it.  My own personal bias, based on my life experience and research, is that we live in a predominantly patriarchal and toxic culture that reinforces these behaviours.<\/p> <p>  In that context, I have a number of questions.  First, if a high profile organisation demands proof, when we know what we know, which is that this is a crisis, should that organisation and its spokespersons and leaders not be very robustly and publicly challenged for holding those views or even asking that question?  Second, given the nature of domestic violence, should we not have more ambition?  Five days is the absolute minimum and under any ethical test, whether Platonic or Aristotelian, that lacks courage, temperance and does not serve a wider justice.  Should we not have more ambition?  Rather than taking a minimum of five days, should we not take a more ambitious approach based on the evidence and the knowledge we have?  We should not be bound, necessarily, by what is happening in other jurisdictions, if we know from the research that five is the bare minimum and is not enough, frankly.<\/p><p> Dr. Duvvury raised the issue of coercive control.  Is there research to which she, Ms La Combre or any of the other witnesses can point us that might provide a useful working definition of \"coercive control\" that would assist us in modifying the legislation?  We all know what it is, but it is emerging into the wider public discourse and is being recognised in the political narrative.  It would be useful if there was a working definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#E00700","speaker":"1699","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Regarding the Senator's first two questions, any organisation that espouses a position regarding proof has to be able to stand up to any robust questioning of that.

Dr. Lindsay Stark is one of the main authors who first expanded our understanding of domestic violence to consider coercive control, which can include a range of behaviours from purely control behaviours, for example, wanting to know where someone is, asking who someone is speaking with and so on, to forms of emotional, physical and psychological violence.  It is a pattern of behaviour that occurs over a lifetime; it is not one incident, but a repeated behaviour.  It does not have to be physical violence.  Ireland's coercive control legislation is important and we can take from it.  In its implementation, though, it seems that an element of physical violence is what we are recognising as violence in the cases that are coming forward.  We rarely recognise asking over and over again who someone spoke to, where did someone go, why is someone not at home by 12 a.m. or 1 a.m. or where did someone drive, yet these are as insidious and harmful as physical violence.  We have to bring to the fore the importance of controlling behaviours, which are the hallmark of coercive control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nata Duvvury"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I recognise the committee's interest in being ambitious in the legislation.

I do not think there is any disagreement from anyone at this committee, or indeed any Member of the Oireachtas, about the granting of this leave.  There may be some dispute over whether we should be brave and ambitious in what we do or whether we should try to lag behind others but I think we broadly agree on the need for this legislation.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  The first is for Ms La Combre and Dr. Duvvury.  Victims believing they will not be believed is an absolutely huge issue.  While it is welcome the Government and the Minister have been pushed sufficiently to remove the requirement for proof, it is not totally gone.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said \"if issues arise with respect to misuse of this leave, changes may be made to permit employers to ask for supporting evidence, should they so require it\".  The removal of the proof is welcome but to leave the door open like that is very disappointing.  It sends a very clear message from the 1950s to women to the effect that we are starting to trust them but we might not and we are going to keep an eye on them.  It is very regrettable but from Ms La Combre and Dr. Duvvury's experience, do they imagine that even the threat of this might have a chilling effect on a worker coming forward to access this leave?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#G00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":397,"content":"<p>From my own perspective and from our union, we have negotiated several workplace policies and this issue has not come up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mandy La Combre"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Ms La Combre is saying employers are not looking for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#G00600","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":399,"content":"<p>They are not looking for it at all.

A person who experiences violence is often extremely powerless and is not able to articulate and fight for what is their due because they believe they deserve it, due to the patriarchal notions that fuel violence.  Even the threat you might have to give evidence or proof will have a chilling effect on people coming forward to apply for leave.

To be fair, I think most of the Government Members agree with us but leaving the door open or even slightly ajar is an issue, and one I wish to see dealt with.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about slashing the ten days to five because of an announcement made by Government but the three parties in government, from my reading of it, all support ten days.  I understand that where it is in existence in this jurisdiction it is ten days.  Fianna F&aacute;il first committed to this leave in 2018, supplied a figure of ten days and has spoken about ten days since.  The Green Party in the North brought forward legislation that provided for ten days.  I think it was about a year and a half ago that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science launched a policy in NUIG and it also provided for ten days.  Do our guests from NUIG and ICTU see the ten days as representative of what is rapidly becoming the norm in the public and private sectors and that such an allocation would fit in broadly with what is being negotiated?  The Department officials referenced looking at other jurisdictions, etc., when they came up with the five days, and I am sure they did.  Where in the civil or public service is it established practice that that would be dealt with?  Is the proposal, say in the example of NUIG, to take back five days from those people or is the proposal that there are two tiers of public servants with some who benefit from the ten days and others who do not?  That is confusing to me and if you do any work at all with victims and survivors of domestic abuse, they will tell you the mixed messages that sometimes come from the establishment are deeply hurtful.  On the one hand you might say you support something but on the other it does not actually manifest.  We all support refuge places but they must be resourced so everyone can access them.  Those mixed messages are deeply hurtful to victims and survivors.  If we are going to establish a minimum threshold it should be set at ten, which is why we are here to debate legislation that provides for ten, but I am interested in the officials' views on how we should start with this, how we should build on it and indeed what is the norm in the private sector.

The policies say ten days in 12 months or whatever but they are not prescriptively sticking to that so it is, as I said, the floor rather than the ceiling.  We should not  be legislating for something that is less than the norm.  We also should not be looking at the lowest common denominator or less than what we already have.

I understand how it works as I have a small amount of experience with it.  If the statutory minimum &ndash; I understand what that is and how that works &ndash; comes in at five days, there is slightly more than a convention within the civil and public service that there would not be a hierarchy when it comes to the implementation of statutory forms of leave and that they would actually have something that is the norm right across the sector.  It just strikes me that we are here debating legislation that I have sponsored, which provides for ten.  However, in the event that is rolled back on by the Government or indeed cut in half down to five, that will cause a problem within the civil and public service.  As a former representative for public sector workers, I do not think they would tolerate having a hierarchy or some kind of a tiered arrangement just simply because some organisations chose to be proactive.  I would hope that the Department would reflect on the message that it sends, that ten days is the norm in the private sector where it is negotiated and it is the norm in the public service where it exists, yet the proposal will be to cut that in half.  That is not a great place to start from.  I completely understand that our witnesses are not here to defend the thought process behind it and I am not asking them to do that.  However, some thought will have to be given by the Department to how this will be implemented.

I take Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s point.  That is why I use the Organisation of Working Time Act, because I believe that contains within it sufficient definition.  However, there is a broader piece of work that needs to be done and it is most likely done at the committee of which I am a permanent member &ndash; the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We should look at that definition of what a worker is, because it is not what it would have been when our parents were heading off to work.  It is different when we are heading off to work, definitely different when our kids will go to work and when our grandkids will go to work it will be different again.

We are grateful to Deputies O&rsquo;Reilly and McDonald for developing this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, in contrast to last week, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth tabled the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill without any provisions for domestic violence leave.  He said he will bring those in on Committee Stage, but that would not allow us to discuss them properly or propose the inevitable improvements required.  I do not agree that the Bill reflects the seriousness of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to support people experiencing domestic violence.  In fact, I think it reveals the opposite and the domestic violence leave component is an afterthought.  It is just not being professionally handled in that sense.  <\/p> <p>  Nonetheless, this Bill is the focus for today.  I think we are all in agreement that victims and survivors of domestic violence are especially vulnerable and leave specifically for this reason is important.  It recognises the realities involved and helps people in desperate need. <\/p> <p>  The issue around IBEC has come up in nearly every contribution.  Needless to say, it was embarrassing and a disgrace for it to come out with those comments.  We are all kind of in agreement that it is not relevant to the discussion that we are having here today.  We are not going to introduce anything along those lines.  However, it speaks to a kind of broader issue that is relevant to today, in that people do not seem to have an understanding of domestic violence for that suggestion to come out.  People were wondering what it meant by &ldquo;prove it&rdquo;.  Imagine - does one turn up with visual injuries?  It is important to highlight as well some of the things that the witnesses said today, such as &ldquo;private matter&rdquo;.  We still see it as a private matter and not a public concern.  That is very true.  The focus is on the victim and not the perpetrator.  Despite the fact that domestic violence affects so many people, there just does not seem to be that awareness, as shown when we had IBEC coming out and saying that.  <\/p> <p>  The discussion around the five days speaks to that problem as well.  It is as if we still do not seem to quite grasp the reality of what it is like for somebody leaving domestic violence.  I have encountered it, for example, when people are fleeing domestic violence and going to the local authority in need of emergency accommodation and then being asked to prove that they are homeless.  If a person has just left a violent situation and has their children, bags, potentially their pets and whatever with them, it is not possible to prove that.  Being met with that kind of hostility very often results in people returning to those violent situations because they feel that they have nowhere else to go.  We have had witnesses before this committee and one of the ones that I just want to rewind to for a moment is Marie Mulholland, who came to speak to us from the West Cork Women Against Violence Project.  She highlighted the unique barriers that women face in rural areas when they are fleeing domestic violence and the court days, trying to get the safety orders and all the different things.  It is not a neat five days and the five days do not necessarily come one after the other.  We also have to take into consideration that people are often making the transition into single parenting and doing things such as managing school runs and other extra-curricular activities.  Five days is just not going to cut it in all reality.  I just wanted to start with that.<\/p> <p>  My first questions are for Dr. Duvvury.  She outlined the role of other reasonable accommodations, such as flexible working, a support to seek protection orders and clear safety measures to maintain confidentiality and privacy as being key comprehensive domestic violence leave legislation.  Can she elaborate on the importance of the suite of measures that we might need to look at?  In her briefing document, she outlined larger issues that surround this type of leave, such as lack of awareness or survivors perhaps not being able to take leave because of a feeling of insecurity around losing their job.  Can she share some more insights from her research or other jurisdictions that could help address those issues?  Her briefing paper also referred to protection for workers from their abusers while they are in the workplace.  Can she outline what that would involve?  Are there examples from other jurisdictions that we might be able to look at?<\/p> <p>  We know that know that the labour market traditionally has been a hostile place for women, with many ingrained malpractices and cultures that still remain.  It is not that long ago that women had to leave work when they simply got married.  In what material ways does Ms La Combre think domestic violence holds working women back today?  She rightly highlighted how leave should be part of a broader domestic violence and work policy that would also support survivors in other ways.  Can she expand on that point and give examples of those supports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#H00600","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a number of questions.

New Zealand has flexible working arrangements.  It is also articulated that if a woman experiencing domestic violence requests flexible working arrangements, the employer must try to facilitate this.  Interestingly, this is also an element in many state-level policies in the United States.  As Deputy Cairns knows, the US has no federal legislation on domestic violence.  Everything in the US is under the Family and Medical Leave Act.  At the state level, many states have specific domestic violence leave measures.  They have articulated the importance of ensuring that flexible working arrangements are possible for a domestic violence survivor to request and that this request must be seriously considered by the employer.<\/p><p> Financial support is also important.  This has been well-articulated in Vodafone's policy and by some of the businesses that have domestic violence leave policies.  They have either given loans for accommodation or to meet the costs of moving.  It can be a loan, a grant or any kind of financial assistance.<\/p><p> The third idea comes from the US.  It involves employers supporting women to get safety orders to address harassment by the perpetrator at the workplace.  We know that for a majority of women who experience domestic violence, the act of violence does not stop at the home.  It travels to work and to the office.  Employers have seen their employees be killed at the workplace.  It has created a great concern.  Employers can play a role in seeking protection orders for employees.  It may involve support for the woman to seek an employment protection order or the employer reaching out to services to help the woman to get a protection order.  Employers also need to interact with and have a vast referral network to other services.  These are some of the accommodations.<\/p><p> I am sorry.

Much research shows that women lose their jobs as a result of suffering domestic violence.  In ICTU's research a number of years ago, there was much commentary about how women lost their jobs.  In cases where managers are unaware of or unsympathetic to the reasons for persistent lateness, unexplained absence or poor performance, employees can find themselves disciplined or even dismissed.  Losing a job and an independent source of income is a disastrous outcome for anybody suffering from domestic violence.  We know there is documentation correlating vulnerability and loss of income.  People suffering domestic violence are more at risk of this because of the disrupted nature of their employment.  If they are consistently losing jobs and in precarious work, the chances of them being able to get away from their abuser or to get themselves out of the situation are lowered since the financial part is so important.  The employer supporting them with policies and paid leave is a significant issue.  Keeping a job is keeping a path to freedom.<\/p> <p>  Regarding domestic violence workplace policies and practical supports, I refer to everything that Dr. Duvvury said.  I have plenty of examples of practical supports where no negative actions would be taken for poor performance, excessive absence or anything like that.  That is in keeping with looking after people.  Supports include making flexible working arrangements available and offering temporary or permanent changes in locations in work roles if they are front-facing.  A significant matter arising in the ICTU survey was that 80% of people surveyed were abused at work on their phone or email, so another support might involve diverting phone calls and emails.  We have salary advances in our workplace policies too.  Some are financial institutions, so if there is coercive control because people's partners are financially controlling them, the institutions can set up separate accounts for them.  There are different things that some employers can do.  We have seen three or four nights in a hotel being paid for by employers.  That is in my own policy at work and possibly in the Vodafone policy and supports people who are escaping violent situations, possibly at a minute's notice.  It is about ensuring that they never work alone, safety planning and so on.  All of this has to be in tandem with the leave.<\/p> <p>  I know I am a big promoter of workplace policies.  I think they are an important part of this.  In the absence of good, robust workplace policies where the organisation understands the issue, it is talked about and the stigma is broken, I cannot see people taking up paid leave.  I cannot see situations where people will go to human resource managers to ask if it is not spoken about in the workplace, not signposted or not something that other colleagues can talk about.  Much research shows that people disclose this to a colleague rather than to a manager or to someone in HR.  Everybody in the workplace knows that it is happening.  That is why policies are so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Mandy La Combre"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I have to leave shortly, so I apologise.

I could listen to her all day.  We do not hear very much about the point she made in her statement about the tendency among people who have experienced domestic violence to minimise it.  They tend to feel that it was not that bad, that they had a lucky escape or that it was worse for a previous person.  We do not talk about that part of domestic violence enough.  It comes back to ensuring people are believed and supported.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that before we had legislation in place on coercive control, people associated domestic violence with physical violence and did not look at other forms of violence, such as emotional abuse and coercive control, and all of the negative impacts they have.  The legislation has been positive in two respects.  Obviously, perpetrators can be brought to justice when there is legislation in place.  In addition, this legislation has changed the conversation in society.  There are even advertisements about it.  One often hears Safe Ireland talking about somebody being on the phone saying he or she is sick, has a headache or cannot make it.  We all seen such situations in some way, shape or form.<\/p> <p>  The ten days' leave is important because it is not just about the days; it is also about having the conversation, over and again, until people in society realise that domestic violence is a real situation and a real problem.  We have to figure out how to tackle it from way beyond getting to the fact that ten days' leave is needed.  We have to tackle it from an early part of life by letting children know what a healthy relationship is and what red flags to look out for.  The more we have legislation, conversations and support, the more the conversation is widened.<\/p> <p>  All of the members left in the room are female.  I know men experience domestic violence, but it is primarily women who experience it.  These women might be more likely to come to us more than to a male Deputy.  The conversation has moved on a great deal, even from when I was first elected in 2016.  We can often dwell on how long it takes to make changes, especially in this institution.  Even though the change can be small, at least it is progress.  I always hope that one or two women tuning in will ask whether they are in that situation and look at what has been happening to them for years, which they have been accepting and seeing as the norm.  Perhaps all the gaslighting and conditioning makes them think it is normal when, in fact, it is not.<\/p> <p>  It is not just about the ten days.  They are crucial, but having legislation for ten days will show that people will be believed and allow them to have the confidence to come forward, even if they never actually need the ten days and are able to work around it.  From a practical point of view, if somebody in an abusive relationship seeks a protection order, that is at least one full day in court.  The case will obviously be heard during Monday-to-Friday hours.  The person then has to apply for a safety order, which may take more than one day.  Deputy Cairns touched on this with regard to a lady from west Cork.<\/p> <p>  Safety and protection orders fall under the family courts.  It might be different in the cities from in rural areas, but in Kilkenny we have one family court sitting per month.  If a person is on the court's list, it may get to him or her, but the person has to be in court for the entire day and may have to come back on a different day.  Three days are gone straight away before the person ever contacts the Garda.  It could take hours, days or weeks to give a statement to the Garda.<\/p> <p>  When one looks at all that, it is not surprising that only one in three women report, which I did not realise was the statistic until today.  That is why.  It is overwhelming and the person has to keep trying to prove domestic violence in various ways, even if proof is not sought.  The ten days are absolutely vital not just from a practical point of view, but also from the point of view of us changing as a society.  We may be getting into difficulties in that it may be unfair of us to legislate for five days when some very good private sector employers such as Danske Bank and Vodafone and others are already providing ten days and are, in fairness, leading the way.  Where does that leave people?  Will those employers go back to five days?<\/p> <p>  I understand I have not asked any questions.  I sought to make the point to the Department that it should look at those ten days in the Bill and see how important they are.  I acknowledge the work that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has done, and especially the work of Dr. Duvvury.  I acknowledge the work she has done, in general, but the points she has made today are very important.  We need to speak about those points much more often.<\/p><p>Does anyone want to make any closing remarks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#K00400","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank the members for the opportunity to come and speak before the committee.  I do not think I could put it any better than the Chair has in terms of the upheaval caused to the lives of people trying to deal with this and the importance of creating a safe space where they can withdraw from work for a period and get the support they need.  For us, ten days is key in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Another point we touched on was trying to ensure this has as broad a scope as possible in respect of employees.  You might say that as a trade union official, I would say that, but it is really important in this context because it is women who are more likely to be in part-time, less secure employment.  For women with a history of experiencing domestic violence, their work history will be impacted by this also.

It is very meaningful to be able to bring research that informs policy making.  I want to end with one very important point, which is that in most economic policies of governments, violence against women is seen as a cultural and, at most, a human rights violation.  It is not seen as an economic issue.  In times of crisis, the first things that are cut are services for survivors of violence.  Domestic violence-led policy is very important because it provides the recognition that this has economic consequences and that is it a working woman's issue, which is very important.  That is the first thing to acknowledge.<\/p> <p>  Second, the policy will be ineffective if it is not connected to a fight against cutting back on resources for services.  We need the wraparound services.  A cost-of-living crisis is coming around the corner.  There will be austerity and budget cuts, because most governments do not see that the inflation we are experiencing today is not caused by workers' wage demands.  It is because of excessive profits, mark-ups and windfalls in the corporate sector.  The first policy the Government will introduce is austerity, and austerity means cutting services to survivors of violence.  This must be connected to the broader argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nata Duvvury"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Do Ms Baxter or Ms Duffy wish to make any closing comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#L00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022101800002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Baxter"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I should say again, as I did at the start, that IBEC had a scheduling issue today and, to be fair to them, it is possible that representatives were not able to make it due to diary commitments.

It is clear that these problems have escalated considerably since the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  My staff and myself, the vast majority of whom are parents, do our utmost to care for and help these children but we are not experts; we are not psychologists and we are not mental health professionals, and that is the type of help many of our pupils need.  The services providing mental health support to children, while excellent when we can access them, are completely inadequate and understaffed.  Children are suffering and getting worse the longer they must wait for expert help.  This must change.  The way I see it, a number of key areas must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The first is the provision of supports to help children to access learning.  The second is the reduction in long waiting lists and waiting times to access external support services.  The third is to increase capacity for early intervention.  Above all, there needs to be joined-up thinking.<\/p><p> I am a member of the Irish Primary Principals' Network and I am representing it today.  I echo the calls in the IPPN submission for a seamless, integrated approach across health and education and for teams of health and education professionals to work with school clusters and individual schools to support children directly in the schools where they learn.  Sufficient capacity and timely access to supports for children are key, while training and support to develop a culture of well-being in schools are also needed. <\/p><p> While the pandemic has made things worse, it is not as though things were great before March 2020.  We have children who are bereaved or whose family unit has fallen apart due to addiction, mental ill health or divorce and separation.  There are children who are homeless, who are living in direct provision or who have fled war-torn countries.  My school has supported children in all of these scenarios.  Some of those children have experienced several of these adverse childhood experiences and traumas simultaneously.<\/p><p> However, there are times when the needs of these children lie far beyond that which schools alone can provide.  This is the point where external support is needed and, too often, it is the point where children are failed.  We know that for children who are experiencing mental health issues, early and appropriate intervention works.  Delays in service provision have a very damaging effect on those experiencing mental health difficulties, their families, communities, schools and other State services.  Children with mental health difficulties cannot afford to wait.  Invariably, the longer the wait, the more entrenched the problem becomes.<\/p><p> Why is this happening?  First, there are acute recruitment challenges across a range of services, including the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, children's disability network teams, CDNTs, and Tusla.  The longer it takes to fully staff these services, the worse the outcomes for these vulnerable children will be.  This is urgent and the system needs to do better.   <\/p><p> Waiting lists are another issue.  Our understanding is that waiting lists for services such as CAMHS, which were already overstretched in 2020, have increased by almost half.  In fact, in our experience, a significant proportion of referrals to CAMHS do not even meet the criteria to be placed on a waiting list so many children are left with nothing.<\/p><p> In schools, there can be issues regarding what we call \"behaviours of concern\" in classrooms and school yards and these behaviours can be severe for the children in question and those around them.  Schools struggle to manage cases of extreme behaviour due in part to a lack of relevant training as well as capacity issues in the support services such as the National Behaviour Support Service, NBSS.  Managing the behaviour becomes the focus and the cause of the behaviour is not addressed as schools and parents do not have access to the professional supports or guidance needed for the child.  Early intervention is essential.  It is our assertion that the services provided under the Departments of Health and Education are completely separate, disjointed and without linkage between the services provided by either Department and with little or no communication about the children accessing the services.<\/p><p> The IPPN has made five recommendations, which are detailed in the submission.  Let us develop a culture of well-being, ensure seamless support from health and education, form teams of health and education professionals, provide appropriate and timely training and pilot approaches to support children's mental health.  The IPPN believes these recommendations would go a long way to addressing the current shortcomings and alleviate the suffering of children and we urge the committee to consider them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda McGorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the committee for the invitation to present.  I am the director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.  The NAPD is the professional association for post-primary school leaders in Ireland and provides a united voice for principals and deputy principals on issues of common concern across all three post-primary education sectors.  I will speak from a practical perspective to identify current practice and to outline some of the challenges facing schools as they endeavour to support students with mental health difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Outside of the family, post-primary schools play one of the most significant roles in the lives of young adults.  Schools recognise this and, as such, create the structures to support all students to try to help them to reach their full potential.  Schools acknowledge that their role is to meet the needs of their students academically, socially, holistically and pastorally.  This means that schools are recognising the person at the centre of the learning, which is the student, and the significance of the relationship between the student and the teacher in order to achieve successful outcomes in learning.  Students learn better in a positive and supportive environment and the creation of this positive learning environment is at the core of the culture in every school.<\/p> <p>  The majority of students will engage with their learning without any major or persistent issues.  However, an increasing number of students are encountering difficulties, which impacts on their ability to engage positively with their learning.  Schools recognise this and endeavour to respond to support their students.  Most schools have a student support team in operation.  This team involves all of the significant school personnel to support the student, for example, the principal and-or deputy, the career guidance counsellor, the year head, the special needs co-ordinator and other qualified and interested teachers.  The student support team will meet regularly and implement school-based interventions to support the engagement of the student with his or her learning in school.  There are, however, limits to what the student support team can do to support students.  Schools are only available to students during their opening hours from Monday to Friday and for 166 school days in the year.  In addition, it is particularly concerning if a student is not attending school, which is a common consequence for students who are impacted by mental health difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Students who are experiencing mental health difficulties and have withdrawn from attending school very often fall between the cracks.  It is fair to say that the majority of schools do not have access to a home school community liaison, HSCL, teacher and this presents particular difficulties for schools connecting with the home to positively collaborate in the best interest of the student.<\/p> <p>  Schools get significant support from NEPS and it is very interesting to hear from its director in her forward to the Department of Education publication, Student Supports in Post-Primary Schools, published in 2021.  In this document, she writes \"many factors that influence a young person&rsquo;s wellbeing are beyond the reach of schools\".  Schools acknowledge this and they continue to work to support their students in the best way they can.  She continues by stating that \"a strong support system in a school can be a vital first step in addressing difficulties, whether through providing inschool interventions and\/or through involving specialist services\".  Therein lies a significant issue for schools - linking with and working with the professional services in the best interest of the student.  Schools can only do so much and then require the support from professional services for the student.  Schools do not have the expertise, facilities and qualified staff to deliver mental health supports to their students.  Schools are not medical establishments, treatment centres or counselling clinics.  They are in fact schools whose primary responsibility is the delivery and support of learning.  <\/p> <p>  This does not, however, undermine the responsibility that schools have to support their students to engage them with their learning and schools generally do this well.  The NAPD would support a call for stronger links for schools with the professional mental health support services, the medical professionals and therapeutic services in a collaborative way to help students to participate fully in their learning and to reach their full potential in their school.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I reiterate a message in my written submission.  There is a need to expedite senior cycle reform to ensure it is more student-centred in its content delivery and assessment practices.  This must be coupled with a reimagined procedure for the selection of students for places in higher education.  The terminal assessment and the higher education selection process, in my opinion, are significant factors that contribute negatively to student mental health.  I thank the committee for listening and I am very happy to answer any questions that it may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Crone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  In the past number of years, we have become aware that mental health impacts have been significant in our adolescents.  Access to guidance counselling and pastoral care or student support teams within schools remains the first port of call for many of our young people.  In the absence of readily available mental health supports within the community or in clinical settings, schools act as a de facto emergency department for mental health and well-being difficulties.<\/p> <p>  The guidance allocation for schools is set out by the Department of Education.  The role of our guidance counsellors has changed and evolved enormously in the past decade.  With the introduction of the new junior cycle, the whole school guidance plan now covers just that - the whole school - in which the guidance allocation forms part of student support and is a pillar of well-being, both as a curricular item and as a tangible for our students&rsquo; lives.  That is a lot.  The ACCS would also note that our community and comprehensive schools with further education programmes do not get a career guidance teacher allocation for those programmes.<\/p><p>Providing schools in our sector with this allowance is essential if our learners are to benefit from the SOLAS national further education and training, FET, strategy.<\/p><p> Many mental health difficulties manifest in adolescence.  In addition, we can now see a measurable increase in mental health difficulties.  That increase is to crisis levels.  In our submission, we have cited a study that lays out \"a growing need to implement policies that will help children and adolescents cope with the short-term and long-term psychological effects of the pandemic\".  Schools see these issues every day, and every day we have to triage our time and attention based on what we know about those we already support educationally and pastorally and what we may need to do for the broken child in front of us now or for the terrified parent on the phone.<\/p><p> The physical activity and well-being study, PAWS, showed an increase in depressive symptoms across adolescents during school closures.  This is borne out in our schools too.  It is a significant challenge.  We are finding that, even outside the overwhelmed guidance counselling support we can offer and that can only be spread so thin, our special education teaching, SET, allocation remains stretched beyond breaking point by the surge in academic and well-being needs brought about by multiple school closures.<\/p><p> We look for help outside our walls, and we acknowledge the work of organisations and agencies that listen to us and try to help.  Formally, links between schools and NEPS continue to be good on an individual basis, but schools observe that the level of day-to-day support is compromised by the small number of referrals that schools can make to a psychologist in a given year.  The current focus of NEPS on emotionally based school avoidance is necessary and welcome and it is working, but the service's time is finite and its resources are meagre, which means that other areas are not being addressed at the level they were before 2020.<\/p><p> Links between the education sector and health services through local CDNTs are inconsistent and the provision of CAHMS remains different from region to region.  In both cases, staffing means that waiting lists vary but are always prohibitively long and students in senior years can age out of services before they reach the front of the queue.  It should never be the advice of any principal or education professional that bringing a self-harming child to an emergency department is the quickest way to access significant services.  On foot of these issues, the response of schools will continue to be individual and often based not necessarily on best practice, but on the practical availability of care for the students in our respective geographical areas.  A large amount still remains reliant on the relationships that school staff have with individuals in local services rather than on developed and established pathways.<\/p><p> Schools are fortunate.  Every year, we get an allocation of teachers based on our enrolment numbers and, in general, schools can appoint teachers to fill those posts.  We know how strongly that contrasts with therapist roles in the HSE across all geographical areas, which are both under-resourced and underfilled.  Unless and until mental health services are brought to a level that matches the increasing needs of our young people, schools will continue to bear the brunt of this.<\/p><p> When we train our new teachers, it could be that basic training in mental health would be of benefit to our students.  It makes sense for this training to be given through initial teacher education or through the Droichead qualification process.  Our teachers of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and our student support teams are conversant in this and have experience working with adolescents who might suffer from poor mental health.  It could be a good thing that all of our classroom teachers would know that this is something for them to understand and assist with, in the same way that education for students with additional needs has moved into the wheelhouse of the classroom teacher rather than just being the job of the support teacher.  However, in doing this, we might normalise the idea that schools are the place for this intervention.<\/p><p> Student voice initiatives in schools are important and can help the development of student-centred and student-led solutions, but we are the adults in the room and it is important that we deal with issues around poor mental health.  Schools cannot keep carrying this.  We do not have the professional expertise.  We are juggling with students' health and we are terrified of dropping a ball.  We do not have the time.  As long as we continue to act in place of proper services, students will continue to fall between the cracks and schools will continue to have to choose whether we support a child in mental health crisis at the cost of the child with a specific learning difficulty.  Some of these choices will have a cost.  In our submission, we have pointed to a need for policy, for pathways and for adequate people to be in place across services, of which education is just one.  We all need a co-ordinated approach to this if we are to help our children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Craig Petrie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in the discussion on this most important of topics.  My opening statement will be a summation of a more comprehensive submission that we have made to the committee.<\/p> <p>  No one in this room needs any lecture on the reality that there exist high levels of damage to young people's mental health due to the isolating and anxiety-inducing effects of the Covid-19 lockdowns and school closures, the impact of technologies on teenagers in particular, the relentless pace of change, and the shortage of community-based services and supports.  Recent reports of dramatic increases in cases of online bullying, the vast majority of which occur outside school settings, demand urgent action.  The social and emotional effects of these anxieties are reflected back into our schools through the attitudes and behaviours of students.  It must be accepted by policymakers that seeking to site both the problem and the solution solely at the door of our schools and colleges represents neither a realistic nor an honest solution to this challenge.<\/p> <p>  While the challenges and solutions are multifaceted, I wish in this brief statement to argue that one of the most effective and, indeed, cost-effective measures the State can provide is to bring our guidance counselling services up to a level where appropriate supports can be given exactly where and when our young people - 1 million of them - are to be found, that is, in our nation's schools.  The JMB's 2023 pre-budget submission is clear about the challenges facing our schools in terms of their guidance counselling provision.  The recent chief inspector's report makes repeated reference to the need for system-level supports to enhance provision for guidance and counselling in our schools, saying: \"Continued enhancement of system supports will be required in the area of Guidance and Counselling to address challenges related to recruitment, curriculum and increasing levels of anxiety among students\".  This call for enhancement of the service predates the announcements regarding senior cycle and the arrival of students from Ukraine.  As these emerging demands collide with the already inadequate allocation of hours for guidance counselling, which are not yet fully restored from before the financial crash cuts of over a decade ago, the capacity of schools to cope will be unsustainable and cases relating to young people in crisis will spill over into the already overwhelmed CAMHS.<\/p> <p>  Speaking of such services, one of the greatest challenges facing school management in making provision for students' mental health support is the discontinuity across the health and education systems in terms of access, availability, tracking and interagency communication.  While each service - NEPS, CAMHS, social workers, the HSE and the Garda - is working intensively to provide relevant and timely services, they all suffer not only from capacity challenges and long waiting lists, but also a lack of coherent provision from a school's perspective.  In this respect, the JMB recommends that the Government initiate a review of interagency co-operation, connectivity and communication with a view to supporting schools in their referrals of students in need of mental health supports and interventions.<\/p> <p>  At school and community service levels, the State must begin to recognise the need to invest in fit-for-purpose interventions to support young people professionally with psychological and psychiatric conditions, those facing LGBT-related mental health challenges, victims of cyberbullying, victims of racism and those engaged in drug abuse, and with tackling the damaging effects of economic disadvantage and social exclusion.<\/p> <p>  School principals need to be freed from excessive workloads so that they can properly attend to student well-being.  In this respect, the most effective solution lies in the allocation of additional deputy principals, DPs, across schools of all sizes and sectors.  I refer members to the JMB pre-budget submission where the case for additional DP allocation is set out.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its attention to this issue and we look forward to the report and recommendations that will emerge from this important conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>The NABMSE welcomes the opportunity to speak on this issue.  We represent the boards of management of special schools and mainstream schools with special classes.  Our schools work with and support students with special educational needs, SEN, from four years of age to 18 years of age with mild, moderate, severe and profound disabilities, with autism, with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, SEBD, and also with complex medical needs.  Meaningful access to education and the physical and emotional well-being of our students are always central considerations of our boards of management.<\/p> <p>  The NABMSE considers that school mental health services are wholly inadequate at post-primary level where students consistently need to be referred to outside agencies for support, where they remain on lengthy waiting lists, even when in crisis.<\/p><p>This happens because the availability and allocation of qualified counsellors to schools is utterly inadequate given the rise in levels of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide ideation, eating disorders, body dysphoria, gender dysphoria and so on among teenagers today.  These are significant issues that, if not addressed early and appropriately, will lead to lifelong difficulties for each of these individuals.<\/p><p> There is no access to mental health services at primary level or in the special educational context.  Even in a crisis situation, for example, where students talking about suicide and self-harming, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is unable to provide any form of concrete support.  Why do we not have suitably qualified child counsellors in primary schools and special schools as members of school staff?  Many children&rsquo;s difficulties could then be identified and that child could be given early support, thus cutting down on more urgent need for intervention when things have significantly deteriorated for that child.  Sadly, when a critical incident occurs in a school in Ireland, NEPS is only allowed to provide support to the teachers at that school.  Its intervention is designed to assist teachers in counselling and supporting the other children in a school, for example, where their friend has died.  In a special school, staff include teachers, SNAs, care workers, nurses, part-time teachers and bus escorts.   All these staff develop friendships with the pupils and often becoming the first confidante when concerns or difficulties arise.<\/p><p> In the case of a critical incident, for example, when a child who attends a special school passes away, which happens often in schools where students have complex medical needs, the other pupils and parents understandably become frightened and disorientated.  Their lives are shaken by the enormity of death.  For children, the concept of death - the \"never again\" - is difficult to comprehend.  SNAs, bus escorts and all the other support staff are not provided with training by the Departments of Education or Health.  The role of trainer and identification of training needs is left to the board of management, principal and teachers in an individual school.<\/p><p> NABMSE, calls for an immediate review of the critical incident policy in schools in Ireland.  This review must examine how counsellors can be deployed to special schools in emergencies.  We need counsellors with specialised training who can work with children, develop staff skills and assist parents with coping mechanisms.  We need to provide direct training to all the support staff surrounding children in special schools.<\/p><p> School attendance is an important contributor to the well-being and general mental wellness of our students.  A small percentage of pupils with special educational needs disengage from school for a variety of reasons and others miss substantial time in school due to prolonged illnesses and hospitalisation.  These pupils need to know there is a future for them in further and higher education.  Supports must be put in place early enough to prevent this drop-out or disengagement, which prevents these students with additional needs from ever having the opportunity to engage with further education or training.<\/p><p> NABMSE also suggests the need to appoint special school liaison teachers who can support families who are often under extreme pressure coping with a child with complex needs.  This teacher would support the children and families in liaising with other agencies, and the positive link with the school could help maintain their child&rsquo;s attendance, positive engagement and achievement in school.  In NABMSE&rsquo;s opinion, the concept of lifelong learning needs to be resourced as early as possible for all pupils presenting with special educational needs in our system.<\/p><p> Our members' board of management reports that it is difficult to co-ordinate services with the HSE and Department of Education, despite the fact there are established and historical links between them.  We understand that pilot programmes are a way of examining how links can be strengthened.  We are, however, concerned that many pupils in our schools across the country suffer silently without support as they have no interventions for as long as pilot studies takes place elsewhere.  We call for an immediate review of all existing pilot programmes with a view to extending interventions and supports to all pupils with special educational needs.  A strong, consistent, accessible multidisciplinary approach has been severely lacking to date.<\/p><p> As I said, a small group of children with additional and special needs disengage from school for a number of reasons.  These can be health, family issues, cultural misunderstanding on the part of the school and staff and mental health issues.  We suggest a special school liaison teacher in every special school, continued support for distance learning and the provision of targeted learning to students who cannot attend due to illness, vulnerability, school refusal and mental health issues.  We also call for cultural awareness training for all our staff in our schools as there is a need for emphasis on knowledge, acceptance and celebration of different cultures and blending these cultures into our everyday learning.<\/p><p> We also need to ensure that students work with other students and look at how groups are formed.  We must develop flexibilities so that students are involved in a wide range of activities and, therefore, in more peer groups.  Children with emotional difficulties currently do not have proper access to psychiatric services.  NABMSE believes this service, along with counselling in schools, needs to be an urgent focus for the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Rourke very much.

ETBs are currently patrons of 27 community national schools alongside being patrons of schools that cater for one third of all second-level schools, which is 100,000 students in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We work in primary, post-primary and tertiary education.  Those schools are welcoming, cater for learners from diverse backgrounds, are learner-centred and attempt to be holistic in everything they do.  We try to support students not just academically but on a range of issues that present, one in particular being mental health issues in the past few years.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has definitely added to that issue although before that, we were severely challenged.  Early intervention is key in preventing children from developing more complex mental health issues later in life.  When schools are adequately resourced, they can play a vital role in the promotion of positive mental health.  We have to recognise that at primary level, however, there are no formal access routes to in-school counselling services and there are no formal structures in all primary schools for supporting students' mental health.  We call for the establishment of student support teams in primary schools to be fully supported.  This could be achieved through a consultation process with the relevant bodies at primary level.<\/p> <p>  At post-primary level, we are very lucky to have the guidance counsellors who all work hard in this area.  However, we need extended training in more therapeutic counselling rather than career guidance.  Many schools at both primary and post-primary level have significant difficulties accessing supports for students with serious mental health issues.  We heard from other contributors today on the increase in waiting lists to services such as child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Ultimately, however, many of these issues fall to the school to address.  No matter what the level of resources or expertise, parents call on schools first.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, ETBI is of the view that a child-centred approach to mental health services is needed yet currently, various mental health services are working in isolation or in silos.  We have a recent example in County Kerry where a number of agencies including NEPS, the counselling services and Jigsaw came together along with the schools.  They have been brought together to provide training to the student support teams in our post-primary schools in the county.  This multidisciplinary approach to training, which was led by NEPS, has led to significant improvements in the ways that student support teams in the county operate.  We call for this to be looked at and extended.<\/p> <p>  We also have the challenge of school leaders not being fully sure on who to bring in to support students.  It is the view of ETBI that mental health initiatives should seek approval from a national body such as the Department of Education or NEPS with clear criteria in order that schools can be confident the initiatives and the people they are bringing in are backed and authorised.<\/p> <p>  ETBs have a proud history of running professional learning networks, PLN.  Teachers and school leaders come together to learn from the best and bring that back to the schools to extend out that learning.  We ask and request that these PLNs be extended into the area of mental health.  Teachers would need to be released to attend the PLNs and paid substitution would be needed for that.  We also see NEPS having a role in providing these PLNs as the resident expert in this area.<\/p> <p>  We echo the call from previous speakers regarding initial teacher education, and mental health should be part of that.<\/p><p>However we also believe that all teachers need to be adequately trained on an ongoing basis to enable them to identify students and families who are struggling in terms of mental health and to provide the most appropriate ways to support them.<\/p><p> What ETBI is calling for is the establishment of student support teams at primary level and the backing of them at post-primary level, which would include an interdisciplinary approach to training those student support teams.  We ask for the establishment of those professional learning networks to ensure that mental health is at the forefront and that this would be supported by NEPS.  We ask that we develop an accredited mental health initiative which is overseen by either the Department or NEPS.  We ask for increased investment in NEPS to allow for further training of school staff and the expansion into counselling services.  We also ask for further exploration into establishing the school-based mental health support teams, which this committee has already started to look at.<\/p><p> As a former principal who has only been out of the position 14 months, I know the role that schools can play, which we have heard about today.  The key thing for me is that schools are nearly always the first stop for parents when they have an issue with mental health.  They go to schools, which do their best to support that.  However, we need further training and resources in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark McDonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe uilig.  I thank the witnesses for their important presentations on this issue of great concern.  It is fair to say that the call for resources would be a significant common denominator in all their presentations.  I am sure they would have support from everybody in this room on that.  I will throw a few hot potatoes of varying levels of heat at the witnesses.  There are some issues I am thinking about and some questions I have.  While I support all the calls for resources, I worry that if we only talk about resources there is a danger we will never have enough resources because we will be subject to the ups and downs in the economy and so on.  That is all the more reason that we are able to ask ourselves if there are ways in which the system is failing and if things could be changed that might enhance those resources or prevent the need for them.  For example, I mention the graduate exodus.  Is it a part of the problem that we are not able to get the people we need?  Do we need to think brave thoughts about reserving places for people who commit to staying in the country after they qualify, for example, in the context of the repayment of fees in the future?  Perhaps there could be some way that a debt could be incurred if they do not stay because it seems to me that the brain drain is part of the story.<\/p><p>I will turn to issues relating to how the system works.  There is an understandable tendency to think in terms of having resources in schools, but that is probably predicated on schools being larger in size.  I question whether that could be a problem.  I mention the concept of Dunbar's number, namely,that people can only relate to 150 other people.  That is an idea that is out there.  Should we be concerned about schools being too big?  Could that be a negative contributor to student mental health?<\/p><p>In recent days, I was struck by all the talk of the great role that the chaplaincy and spiritual support played in Donegal in the context of the terrible tragedy there.  I am sure the witnesses will have seen various articles on that by various commentators.  In addition to talking about the important role of guidance counsellors should we be saying more about chaplains?  I often think of Victor Frankl's book <i>Man's Search for Meaning<\/i>and Nietzsche&rsquo;s quote: &quot;He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.&quot;  The Education Act 1998 talks about physical, moral, spiritual and social education.  The SPHE consultation document is much more stripped down and talks about physical and emotional education.  I wonder if we are missing something in the system and if we are, I wonder if we are brave enough to talk about that.  My impression is that what is proposed in SPHE is fairly stripped down and does not talk about much to do with friendship, nor does it mention bereavement at all.  I was interested in what Ms O'Rourke had to say on that subject.  Do we need to start asking questions about the things we discuss and the things we do not discuss?<\/p><p>I was glad to hear what Mr. Crone had to say about the points system.  The tail of the high points courses is wagging the dog of the whole system.  We have discussed this in this committee before but I refer to preventing student anxiety and mental health problems at whatever level of the scale they are experienced and we have to say that the CAO and the colleges have a responsibility here.  Those are my various potatoes and I would be glad to hear what the witnesses have to say on any or all of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#F00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>The Senator made some interesting points.  The issue of the graduate exodus troubles us because on one level we are looking for extra provision in the arena of guidance counselling but we know we have a teacher shortage as well so where will we get these guidance counsellors?  It can be planned.  We know the surge in pupil numbers in post-primary education will peak in 2023, so we would imagine that perhaps we should be planning now for the fact that we will have extra teachers on board at that stage.  The graduate exodus is perplexing because we do not know where all the teachers are going.  If you look at the figures we have from the Teaching Council for registered practitioners, there are many more teachers on the books than we have in play.  This year it has not been as acute as it might have been last year, but we need to do a little bit of thinking on where we might get the extra guidance counsellors from.  We would say that some of the training courses we have need to be augmented and we would say the financial assistance for teachers who might want to engage in guidance counselling courses should be put in place.  We would have some solutions that we would be able to suggest in that arena but it is an issue for us.  Even in preparing the submission, the duality we came across was that in talking to the Department, we acknowledged that there is a teacher shortage.  If we bring down the pupil-teacher ratio at this stage in post-primary schools it will cause us difficulties.  We should be planning forward two or three years.  If the Senator looks at our pre-budget submission he will see what our thinking in that arena is.<\/p> <p>  Schools do not necessarily need to be bigger in the context of giving schools the provision to help students in this sphere.  We made the point on extra help for schools around deputy principal provision.  If the school leader can be freed up as much as possible from some of the administrative duties that the principal will have, the care will trickle down and the principal will be able to spend more time looking after the students in his or her care.  Some kind of change and help for principals around deputy principal provision is hugely important.  When you talk about chaplaincy you are making a point and we have made that point to the Department in a number of engagements.  Schools in our sector do not have chaplains and it would be a fantastic addition to the school system if we could enhance that provision and give it to schools that do not have it.  There would be great value in that.<\/p> <p>  The SPHE programme will be augmented as we move through it.  The training that will be given to teachers in the SPHE space will allow them to deal with issues such as relationships in a fundamental way.  I am very hopeful that the new SPHE guidelines will help us in this regard.  On the senior cycle, we all hope that the demands on our students might change over the years.  A great deal of work is needed in that space in the coming years but we are all of the view that we need to bring in senior cycle reform to help the mental well-being of our students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which all basically say the same thing.

That has changed, and those referrals now have to be made through the GP rather than the school.  The nature of how referrals are made has moved such that they are parent and family centred rather than school centred.  This means it is the parents' responsibility to make the referral, but that assumes parents are agentic and in control and can manoeuvre the web of waiting lists that is out there.  Parents will then ask us whether we can intervene on their behalf, so we need to get written consent from parents for every service under the GDPR and all the other barriers that are put in our way.  There was a time when I could ask for a case conference in respect of a child, where the child was at the centre of the table, and I would speak figuratively before the meeting about the child being at the centre of the table, where I could draw in those services.  That has been diluted to the point where it just does not exist anymore, and that is down to staffing levels and to the cuts that were introduced ten years ago not having been reinstated.  The service has been absolutely skeletised.  We have talked about balkanisation, the need for integration and joined-up thinking and silos.  We have an amazing vocabulary but we have not made the connections we need to make.  I work in a children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s services committee, CYPSC, the young people services committees that try to bring together the health and education services, such as Tusla, CAMHS and primary care.  The Department of Education will not even turn up to discuss these issues.  It tells us it is a matter for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, or NEPS.  We cannot get it to engage.  I am working on a pilot project in my area, in Dublin 15, to see whether we can get back to doing what we used to do, namely, family-based services.  The one thing we know about almost every child in the country is that they attend school, so let us pull services in around those children in order that we can make a difference.

Deputy Conway-Walsh is correct in that a lot of the statements reflected the same kinds of issues and problems, although, obviously, they have had differing experiences.  It struck me that they are calling for teacher training in the area of mental health services, which demonstrates that this is not just about looking for more resources.  It is about a whole-of-education-system approach, so it is reasonable to say we need more resources as well as believing that all teachers should have training.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Petrie stated that the school is the first port of call.

Not only must we look at mental health services but we must also focus on the difficulties faced in modern life by young people and how we address that in schools, particularly around tolerance.  In some schools I have come across, there is a difficulty with hearing all voices and respecting everyone's opinion.  When that opinion is damaging to another person and the expression of that opinion undermines another person's rights, teachers can feel trapped between two constitutional rights, in some ways.  What can we do before the mental health services get involved?  Are there other things we can do to support teachers in addressing those conflicts, for want of a better word, between students that lead to mental health problems?  I am referring to bullying and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#G01500","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":471,"content":"<p>A lot of good work has been undertaken in schools in recent years to try to help students who might be having difficulties.  The well-being guidelines produced in conjunction with junior cycle reform are very important.  A review of anti-bullying policies in schools is under way and is also feeding into that.  The document, Looking at Our School, which is a blueprint for best practice in schools, was reviewed this year.  Its initial iteration was in 2016.  Well-being is mentioned 28 times in the document.  We have moved from talking about student voice to student participation.  A lot of good work is taking place in the school communities to try to address some of these issues.  I would like to think that schools are increasingly becoming kinder places because of these kinds of interventions.  We need to that ongoing work at school level to be matched with resources.  While I do not want to come back to resources all the time, it is very important to free up school leaders as much as possible to give them time to reflect.  Augmenting guidance counselling would also be hugely important.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked for priorities, and I take her point.  We could do more in initial teacher education.  That is a tick box and a recommendation from this committee would be very important.  The review of services between CAMHS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not dealing with a simple area.  We know from dealing with social workers and staff in CAMHS that they are, like us, overstretched.  There is no magic solution for this.  We just have to work through it systemically.  We have found that GDPR and confidentiality have closed down certain avenues for us where we used to have informal engagements.  We could reflect on how we can improve on that area.

I take the point that a chaplain can be enormously supportive resource in a school.  However, many of our schools do not serve Catholic populations.  We have a wide range of Educate Together schools, community and national schools and non-designated schools in the ETB system.  I do not mind what an extra support person is called in the school but if we are to be truly inclusive, we need counsellors who are trained to support a wide range of students.  We should perhaps widen our thinking a little.  Do we need to take a teacher out of a school in order that he or she can return as a guidance counsellor or counsellor?  Can we train counsellors who are not necessarily teachers to go directly into schools?  I know staffing is a huge issue at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Another point that was raised, one to which I referred in my opening statement, was cultural awareness training.  If our schools are to be meaningfully inclusive in the way they operate, we need to address a lot of issues.  Professor Dympna Devine published a study not long ago which showed that over 95% of our teachers are white and Eurocentric in their views.  We have black children and children who are gay or may have a disability who can go through the entire system and never see themselves positively reflected anywhere.  I am doing a small study at the moment.  Students, while they acknowledge black history month and cultural awareness week, say that when they return to the classroom where the important stuff happens the curriculum is white, fully-abled and straight.  There are very practical things we can do around that to help people feel less othered, more included and positively reflected in our system.  Obviously, that will help with students' level of engagement and their self-worth and self-esteem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Rourke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>To respond to Senator Pauline O'Reilly's point on resources - I think Senator Mullen made the same point - it is important to say this needs to be properly resourced if we are to meet the challenge.

We have given some examples from the ETBI submission, which has been echoed elsewhere, about initial teacher education.  That needs to be looked at but there is also the ongoing training of staff.  That is very resource light but its impact can be huge.  We spoke about the PLNs where one person is trained in bringing that network back to the staff.

I thank the schools, school communities and boards of management around the country.  I have no doubt this is a complex and far-reaching issue on which so much needs to be done.  I know all involved are doing their best to try to grapple with where we are.  There is no doubt that pupils are experiencing emotional distress, trauma and bereavement, as was highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is fair to say that there is no one size to fit every situation.  We need supports in place for students and teachers.  There is no doubt we also need to look after the mental health of teachers.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge that there has been a shift.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, sought and received funding of &euro;5 million for a pilot scheme for a programme of counselling supports for children.  That is ground-breaking in the development of school counselling.  Those supports offer an opportunity for early intervention, which is of great importance.  More important, this also brings recognition that mental health in schools is an educational issue.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McGorman stated that in his experience education has not come to the table.  That concerns me and it is important that we try to do something about it because the particular link that was made indicated a divergence from the opinion that this is a health issue and not an educational one.  I hope that will herald change.  I acknowledge Se&aacute;na Brady who did a of work in my party on that issue.<\/p> <p>  We should have preventative measures in place to ensure positive mental health as opposed to dealing with crises when they arrive.  I have some experience of restorative justice.  My understanding had been that this was a process that teachers and principals could bring in to schools when negative behaviour arose and that it could provide support in that way.  It was a very good system.  I was in a school recently in Newbridge where the teacher uses different forms of this throughout a school lesson and I was greatly impressed.  This was to check in where students were and they could give a number.  I am sure many of the witnesses are familiar with this.  It was excellent and gave every pupil an opportunity to be heard with respect to where he or she was at that particular time point in time.  I ask the witnesses to respond on that.<\/p> <p>  I agree that the whole-school, community-based approach is important, with stakeholders coming together.  I am from Rathangan, which is a small town, and we had a very difficult situation approximately 12 years ago, which I will not go into now.  We had a fantastic response from all the State services.  They came together and formed a circle with the school and community.  It very much worked in preventing further suicides and trying to ensure the young people felt heard, whether they needed to have positive mental health examples in their life or were in crisis themselves.  I agree with the importance of home school liaison teachers and I am conscious of schools that do not have such a teacher.  I completely agree with NABMSE on having a special school liaison teacher appointed to support families.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to comment, including on preventative measures and supporting positive mental health if they so wish.

I note as well that the Sub-Committee on Mental Health met this morning.  Balkanisation was mentioned.  It is interesting that even in the Houses of the Oireachtas this morning, three different committees met to discuss more or less the same issue.<\/p> <p>  As a former primary school teacher, I share some of the frustration I have heard from members that teachers are often the last to hear and the last to be listened to, despite the fact that they spend 25 or more hours a week in the company of these children and often, apart from their parents, are the people who know these children best.  Yet there does not seem to be a way to make those teaching professionals heard in respect of provision of mental health services, and that is a huge opportunity missed.<\/p> <p>  The thing that jumped out at me from the IPPN presentation was that we should have teams of education and health professionals to work with school clusters and individual schools to support children directly in the schools where they learn.  To give a concrete, real-world example of that, I know of an inner-city Waterford school where there are three different CDNTs represented within that school community.  One of them is based out of Dungarvan for those in Waterford west, so some of the children there are supposed to access their services in Dungarvan.  That is an hour from the school each way, plus the appointment time.  That is a full day for the parents.  For God's sake.  The school is open to this and has talked to me about it.  Why on earth would we not host the services in the school building?  I know that creates the issue of competency and who is in charge of that, and there is already a heavy load on school principals without having to become health professionals as well as everything else they are supposed to do, but there are opportunities there as well.<\/p> <p>  I think Mr. Crone said that schools are really good at supporting the many and that it is the few we need the specific help with.  Mr. McGorman said we see the role tapered.  That really is the case.  We have a huge resource in respect of our teaching profession, notwithstanding that we are losing teachers and they are going abroad or moving to other areas.  One of the strengths of education in Ireland, however, is that we have continued to attract really good candidates into the profession and that our education system is built on the quality of the teachers we have rather than other things.  We are making progress on the pupil-teacher ratio and issues like that, but the fact that we have good-quality people in the sector is the foundation stone of our education system.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to career progression and allowing and enabling people to move into something like educational psychology or provision of other services.  Other than that, when someone enters a teaching career, he or she will either do 40 years in the classroom or take a principalship.  Many teachers I know are not interested in a principalship because those who take them stop teaching.  For a walking principle, that is the end of it.  The day teachers enter a principalship, they become administrators and can forget about teaching.  They will occasionally get to interact with classes, but most of the time they are giving out to bold people, which is probably not why they got into teaching in the first place.  We have a huge resource there and people who need other progression pathways.  It seems clear as day to me that we should be pointing them in directions where they can support, interact with and teach children in a different way in our school systems.<\/p> <p>  As for educational psychologists, it would be such a huge resource, even while people are training, if they could provide, for want of a better word, that triage service of looking at people's needs and just making sense of them.  Then, by the time the children are sitting in front of the educational psychologist, they are making best use of that time and not engaging in form-filling.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if anything I have said has amounted to a question in terms of punctuation marks.  I do not know if I quite got to a question mark at the end of that.  It was mainly observations.

As for the CDNTs, it is exactly as the Deputy said.  That is a massive frustration for us.  If I may give an example, we have one special school in our area, Dublin 15, that has five CDNTs working with it, so I can talk about one child with speech and language difficulties but not another child.  The other child does not have a speech and language therapist in his service, and there is one principal dealing with all of five different services.  We said at the start, when CDNTs were being reconfigured, that this was the wrong way to do it.  We are proactively working on that.  We have convinced the HSE to come on board and put in place one service for the school in question, see how it works and put all the resources into that in one case.  Then, if we can show that it works successfully there, let us move it out beyond that.<\/p> <p>  As for the notion of teacher career progression, we have to grow up about this.  We have to be mature about it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has hit the nail on the head in respect of teacher progression.  Not everybody wants to be sitting in sixth, fifth, fourth or third class for 40 years.  We have different routes.  It is a question of having that talent and availability there and the need to match them up.  There is also the idea of getting people in training - and we have said this to speech and language therapists as well as psychologists in training - out and working in schools to assist and to do some of the lifting along the way.  That that would be really welcome as well.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator O'Loughlin, I emphasise again the huge amount of work going on in schools.  The Senator is absolutely right.  I had in my school a tragedy when we had five deaths in one year, one by suicide.  Every single time people looked to the school community for leadership.  Every single time they asked, \"Where is the principal in this?\" and \"What can we bring to the table?\"  Schools are more than willing to bring that expertise, compassion and, dare I say it, love with them, but when we put our hands out for the supports, that is when the support has been found lacking.<\/p> <p>  I hope that answers some of the issues Senator O'Loughlin and Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda McGorman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>If I may, the issue of fluidity is very important because what we find in our schools is that oftentimes the principals are the leaders in the school.

We have huge problems at the moment, especially in the area of guidance counselling.  We just do not have enough people out there.  I absolutely take the point about fluidity.

The new assumption, especially under the HSE model, is that the parents are agents who are able to command all the services are their child and draw the services in.  That is not the reality and parents experience massive difficulties in trying to negotiate their way around these services.  It is similar for GPs.  For me to talk to the GP of a child, I have to get the signed consent from the parent and email it to the receptionist to pass on the GP before the GP will take a phone call from me.

They ask whether we have the permission of the parent and when we respond that we have, they ask whether we have it in writing and even if we do have it in writing they still will not discuss the needs of the child.

She mentioned that we were coming with solutions.  I will talk about special and primary schools together because, as the committee knows, special schools are seen as a subset of primary schools, which I do not always think is appropriate but I will go with it for this comment.  We all know that our children are given phones at earlier and earlier.  That means they are open to a toxic and destructive habit, which brings them down rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, items on the dark web, all sorts of websites encouraging eating disorders and very harmful and destructive behaviours.  That, combined with Covid-19, means there is a crisis brewing in our primary schools.<\/p> <p>  In special education, one of the two practical solutions we could put in place very quickly is administrative deputy principals for special schools.  Our special schools do not really meet the numbers border for any of the general allocations given out to mainstream primary schools.  This is because in special schools, it is about need rather than numbers.  The other thing that would be incredibly helpful to special is the reintroduction of something along the lines of class hours.  That was incredibly beneficial because of the flexibility built into it.  We do not have substitution now for the first day of absenteeism, which is enormously problematic in special education where you cannot divide classes out among other teachers.  It was mentioned earlier that we know who the caring person is in our schools and who can be there when a child needs someone that minute, when they are incredibly anxious or they are having a crisis or an anxiety or panic attack or whatever it is.  You need the flexibility to have somebody there at that moment.  Something along the lines of the class hours would give schools that flexibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I could write books on mobile phones; I have children myself.

They have a principal and the vice principals are kind of teaching; there is no walking vice principal in that size of a school.  When you go to a secondary school, where there could be 350 students, there is a principal and a walking vice principal.  What is needed to get the larger primary schools the same services as the secondary schools?  I mean no disrespect to the secondary schools, they need them and deserve them, but so do primary schools.  As you said, specifically in the senior cycle in primary schools, they are now having similar issues and problems that secondary schools had a number of years ago, in that children are now having anxiety problems and are facing issues in life, whether it involves mobile phones or whatever.

It is a real question for us as school leaders at primary level.  There are two priorities for school leaders at primary level, from a leadership development point of view.  The point about the role of the teaching principal has to made as well.  Up to 40% of our schools have teaching principals, meaning that the principal in those schools has teaching duties, as well as the deputy principal.  It would be remiss of me to address this issue without addressing that as well.  It is not just large schools that need the support of an administrative deputy principal.  If you are a teaching principal in-role as a teacher, you have all of the responsibilities is that have been laid out here as well.  Chaos and stress do not choose when they arrive on a particular day.  All human life is represented in our schools.  Our teaching principals are right at the coalface concerning this issue.<\/p> <p>  On administrative status for deputy principals, again, our post-primary cousins have been very successful in raising that and having that addressed as an issue.  We have had to balance between a call for administrative deputy principals and support for our teaching principals, who get one administrative day a week now.  That is something for which we were fighting for years.  As a result of the pandemic, it was given and we have retained it.  However, that does not diminish the call for administrative deputy principals.  If we were to ask the why of it here at this committee, it is about supporting the co-ordination of special education needs because it has become so complex at primary level.  It has become the catch-all for everything.  Special education needs has been used to cover every single thing we have talked about here, as well as the cognitive developmental issues that children have in mainstream education and their educational needs.  If we were to make a recommendation around this, it would be to support the co-ordination of special education needs.  That would be one massive area which could encompass or include or allow for the management of special education needs as part of the role of an administrative deputy principal.<\/p> <p>  It is down to economics, resources and priorities at the end of the day.  The Department will consider an administrative deputy principal in very large schools, but we would be anxious for that to be pulled down.  If there are schools where there are more than two special classes or a class for children with autism, those schools also get administrative deputy principals.  The principle has been conceded and it is down to budget and priorities, ultimately, as to how it is allocated on a year-to-year basis.  Certainly, every year the IPPN makes submissions as part of the budgetary submission in relation to our teaching principals and administrative status for larger schools as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda McGorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Take the example of St. Aidan's primary school in Enniscorthy.

It is a very important issue.  It is only really coming into play in the last ten years during which time the number of SNAs in schools has increased.  The extra staffing that principals have to manage is not reflected in any way, shape or form in the context of allocation to the schools or the salary earned by a principal.  This is something that will have to be looked at.  Fundamentally, what has been said about deputy principals is correct.  In our submission, we made three fundamental points.  One was around provision of guidance counsellors, one was around inter-agency co-operation and the final one around trying to give time to principals, as leaders in the school, to deal with the problem kids and the students in their care.  Any way we can augment the provision of deputy principalships in our schools, we think that is huge.<\/p> <p>  We are very concerned about burnout among principals at the moment.  During Covid things settled a little at school level because things quietened down to some extent but we are becoming more concerned now that there is burnout.  Principals put up with a lot during Covid, they did an awful lot and they gave a lot of themselves.  We think the best supports for schools come in at the deputy principal level, whether at primary level or post primary level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101800002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I have three examples in Wexford where the principals retired and I was sure the deputy principals would take up the positions.

I am Chair of the Psychological Society of Ireland&rsquo;s special interest group in perinatal and infant mental health, SIGPIMH.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. Jillian Doyle, and she is a committee member of the special interest group.<br\/><br\/>Perinatal services are where the earliest interventions begin for mothers, care givers, and infants.  These are the interventions that set the foundation for the mother-child relationship and, indeed, provide the blueprint for much of a child&rsquo;s later emotional development.  We know that investing early and smartly by supporting parents and family systems is likely one of the more cost-effective ways to promote mental health.<br\/><br\/>The focus on mothers, infants and relationships in the context of the broader family.  Today, we will advocate for a broadening of the model of perinatal health in the following ways: to invite the infant into the perinatal services and the services into the world of the infant; to include those who have been largely excluded; to provide a continuum of care between perinatal and community services; and enable perinatal services to become trauma informed.  <br\/><br\/>As the perinatal model of care takes root, psychologists increasingly recognise the need to provide services that cater to the needs of the mother-child dyad.  Perinatal teams are at capacity in meeting the mental health needs of pregnant and postpartum people.  We know that the first 1,000 days are the most significant in a child&rsquo;s development and, therefore, we believe that each of the perinatal teams would benefit from an infant mental health practitioner.  We also strongly advocate for the provision of mother and baby units that cater comprehensively for the needs of the mother, child and family.<br\/><br\/>We must move towards a model of combined care that alleviates the mental health burden on parents and encourages the global development of children.  The current iteration of the perinatal services is not equipped to carry out work with babies.  Services are in portacabins and in shared office spaces.  We need to expand perinatal services so that both mothers and babies are supported, and clinicians have the appropriate tools to do the therapeutic work.  <br\/><br\/>To date, no service has been developed for partners in the perinatal period.  Evidence suggests an unmet treatment need for paternal depression and anxiety.  Lack of support from the partner is one of the strongest predictors of postnatal depression in women.  This is a service gap.<br\/><br\/>Teenagers are at high risk of developing perinatal mental health disorders.  Due to their age this cohort cannot access perinatal services thus denying them access to timely and appropriate care.  We advocate for the provision of psychological care to this cohort and believe that a working group could be formed to explore how best to provide this care.<br\/><br\/>Unsurprisingly, parents of premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, are at high risk for depression, anxiety and acute traumatic stress with negative implications for parenting and infant development.  Researchers recommend ongoing assessment of the perinatal mental health needs of parents as part of the network of services available in NICU.  Adequate staff resourcing of the health and social care professionals team, as highlighted in the neonatal model of care, would help actualise perinatal and infant mental health across NICUs and paediatric intensive care units or PICUs in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Primary care psychology services are ideally placed to meet the unique experiences of the perinatal period.  The perinatal model of care advocates for primary care psychologists to prioritise pregnant women.  Prioritisation has been impacted by restrictions on public health nurse screenings, which limits referrals, and by long waiting lists.  We believe that investment in primary care psychology will ensure a continuity of care for women and families.<br\/><br\/>Finally, best practice tells us that care offered to women should be trauma informed.  Trauma-informed care prioritises safety, choice, decision-making and control.  Healthcare professionals also need to be supported via the provision of adequate staff, regular training and supervision about how to communicate with and care for women.<\/p><p>The Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, recognises that operating from this value base will require significant systemic change.  However, we believe that the benefits to women, infants, partners, healthcare staff and society will ultimately greatly outweigh the cost of change.<\/p><p> According to the eminent psychologist John Bowlby, &ldquo;If a community values its children, it must cherish their parents&rdquo;.  In the PSI and our special interest group, we strongly believe that perinatal and infant mental health services offer a unique opportunity to cherish both parents and children in Ireland.  We urge you, the leaders of our country, to invite in the infant, the mother and the family.  As a State, we have birthed these perinatal services; now it is time to parent them and help them to reach their full potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eithne N&iacute; Longphuirt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the committee very much for the invitation to talk about the issues relating to perinatal mental health.  My colleague, Dr. Margo Wrigley, the national lead for the specialist perinatal mental health programme, and I are here on behalf of the HSE.<\/p> <p>  In my role as national clinical adviser and group lead in mental health, I work with national leads and programme managers on the design and implementation of the clinical programmes in mental health.  The specialist perinatal mental health programme is one of these.  Other programmes we look after include programmes on: self-harm in emergency departments; early intervention in psychosis; eating disorders in adults and children; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, in adults; and dual diagnosis, which is where addiction issues and mental health issues present together.  We also support service improvement programmes such as those on mental health services for those with intellectual disability and older persons.  <\/p> <p>  All of these clinical programmes and service improvements have certain things in common.  One is that they address unmet clinical need.  Most of the mental health services are delivered by primary and secondary care services but there are certain cohorts of patients that need bespoke specialised services.  Clinical programmes and service improvement programmes plug that gap.  We have an overarching aim of standardising quality, evidence-based practice across mental health services.  This means that the service provided in Dublin should be the same as that provided in Cork, in Donegal or anywhere else in the country.  We try to step in early.  Early intervention is key.  Community orientation is one of our focuses.  Rather than bringing people into acute units, we try to manage them in the community as much as possible.  Most of our models of care and initiatives involve work with training bodies and voluntary organisations.  We take a holistic approach with all of these programmes.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, most mental health services are delivered by primary and secondary care services.  Only those patients who require a bespoke specialist response to ensure their needs are met promptly by skilled mental health professionals are referred to these clinical programmes.  The specialist perinatal mental health programme specifically meets the mental health needs of women during pregnancy and up to a year post delivery.  This programme was launched in 2017 and implementation started in 2018.  Dr. Wrigley will brief the committee on the services now available for women.  We have prepared a few slides that give an overview of the service.

The next slide aims to put the programme in context.  On the numbers side of the slide, we see the number of women likely to develop mental health problems each year.  These figures are based on an annual birth rate of approximately 60,000.  To give on example, approximately 2,000 women might be expected to develop a severe depressive disorder.  The other point to be made is that women may suffer from a whole range of mental health problems.<\/p><p>My colleague, Professor McCarthy, will give members a bit more of a feel for that.<\/p><p> When we started this programme, there were just four whole-time equivalent staff working in the area of perinatal mental health, all based in Dublin.  There were three part-time psychiatrists.  One was working with a mental health clinical nurse specialist, the second was working with two perinatal mental health midwives and the third was working alone in the Coombe hospital.<\/p><p> It is really important to identify these problems not only because of the impact on the mother, which is substantial, but also because of the impact on the infant, which can be lifelong, causing a range of emotional, behavioural and cognitive problems.  Naturally, of course, there is an impact on the wider family.  There is a very strong economic argument for providing services.  A very reputable study carried out by the London School of Economics showed that for each birth in the UK, there was a cost of &pound;10,000 in terms of perinatal mental health problems.  This was for each woman, irrespective of whether she had such a problem.  It was found that the cost to remedy the problem would be just &pound;600.  In that context, there is an enormously strong economic argument for dealing with the problem.<\/p><p> The seminal event in developing this programme was the publication of the Government's national maternity strategy in 2016.  At that time, we had a mental health division within the HSE and considered the strategy.  That then national director decided it would be appropriate for us, as the providers of secondary care mental health services, to consider how we might meet the requirements associated with the seven mental health points outlined in the strategy.  As Dr. Niazi has already said, we worked on the strategy and it was published at the end of 2017.<\/p><p> The working group was multidisciplinary, as one would expect with any mental health strategy, but, crucially, we had service-user input provided by the Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services - Ireland, AIMSI, through Dr. Krysia Lynch.  While we had been asked to look at the specialist perinatal mental health response to women with moderate to severe problems, on foot of the strong advocacy of AIMSI we expanded that to ensure there would also be a response provided to women with mild to moderate problems.  We covered those two areas.  The aim was to have both responses integrated with the maternity services because it is in those services that pregnant women and women whose babies are to be delivered present.<\/p><p> The next slide is to show members exactly what we have developed.  We had two challenges to start off with.  One was that there are actually 19 maternity services in Ireland.  The second was that the number of births ranged from a high in the Rotunda last year of over 9,000 to a low of 950 in the south Tipperary maternity service.  A number of the services have a high number of births, a couple have an intermediate number, and most have about 1,500.  Therefore, in order to provide a national service, we recommended the development of the service according to a hub-and-spoke model in line with the maternity networks recommended in the national maternity strategy, which are modelled on the hospital groups.  The idea was that the hub hospital maternity service would host the multidisciplinary specialist perinatal mental health team, led by a perinatal psychiatrist.  I have listed in the slide where the six services are based.  In the spokes, the psychiatry service is provided by liaison psychiatry.  We recommended that both elements have perinatal mental health midwives working within the 19 services.  The map shows the hub-and-spoke model.  In Galway, for instance, the team is based in Galway University Hospital maternity service and it is working with four spokes: Portiuncula, Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny.<\/p><p> The only point I would like to make on this clinical pathway is that when a woman arrives at a maternity service for the first time for her book-in clinic, she meets a midwife.  The midwife asks her not only about her physical health but also about her mental health.<\/p><p>The two specific questions asked are if she has in the past month been feeling low, depressed or down in herself; and if she has in the past month lost interest or pleasure in doing things.  If the woman says \"Yes\", she is asked if this is something she would like help with and can then be referred on to the service.  Other questions are also asked about current and past mental health history and family history.  Who the woman is seen by depends on the severity of the problem.<\/p><p> The responsibility of the hub team is to provide advice to the spokes - specifically the perinatal mental health midwives and the liaison service - offer second opinions on women attending those spoke services where this is clinically indicated, organise monthly network meetings and organise relevant education for the staff in both hub and spoke services and the maternity service as a whole.<\/p><p> We are almost five years on from the implementation of the programme.  I, as clinical lead, and Ms Fiona O'Riordan, as programme manager, were asked by the national director of the mental health division to stay on and oversee the implementation of the programme.  We were very fortunate in that, right from the start, there was some funding allocated to implement the model of care.  The division allocated &euro;1 million.  A further &euro;2 million was allocated by the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health at the time.  Subsequently, &euro;1.2 million was allocated to us by the national women and infants health programme.  That was specifically for the perinatal mental health midwife posts.  Last year we got another &euro;0.6 million from the national women's task force.  We have a total of &euro;5.8 million to implement part of the programme.  What we worked on in the early days was recruitment, training and induction of new staff.  We were very lucky that though we only had four people working in the area, they were all very highly skilled and very supportive of the programme, particularly Professor McCarthy.  They were involved in providing induction and people came to visit the services and stayed with them for periods of time.  When the first two full-time perinatal psychiatrists were in post in April 2018, we set up a national group.  That has expanded to encompass all six hubs and ensures spoke representation and representation from each discipline.  For instance, we have Dr. Niamh O'Dwyer from Limerick representing psychology.  We developed a data set to capture clinical activity and we have worked on advancing the development of a mother and baby unit.<\/p><p> To give the committee an idea of the staffing that is in place, we now have a full staffing of all the multidisciplinary staff we recommended for each of the hub teams.  We have included the administrator in the hub team because they are the first point of contact for women and their families so it is important to have them working with us as part of our team.  In addition to the recruitment for the hub teams, we also recruited perinatal mental health midwives for each of the spoke sites, with 13 in total.  They are all in place, as well as perinatal mental health midwives for the hub sites.  I have listed the sites on the slides.<\/p><p> As to how we were able to implement all of this, we had an implementation mechanism that was put in place by the division.  Ms O'Riordan and I have done that.  We also had funding allocated because we would have gotten nowhere without funding, to be quite honest.  We had the existing highly-trained staff, as I have already mentioned.  We were able to work collaboratively with the national women and infants health programme, so that is very much in line with Sl&aacute;intecare principles of integrated care.  A key part of this was developing the perinatal mental health midwife role.  That started in the Rotunda but is now available at all 19 sites.<\/p><p>We also have good working relationships with hub and spoke sites and the HSE national recruitment service.  We have provided two tranches of bespoke training.  We had a link with Maudsley Hospital in London, which was very helpful in that regard, but now have our own very highly trained staff.  We have developed a map for all staff who are in contact with women in this period.  In a recent development, we now have six full-time higher training posts in perinatal psychiatry which means that we can provide our own psychiatrists who are trained in this specialist area to work with women during the perinatal period.<\/p><p> Moving to the next slide and without wishing to paraphrase a very famous man who was previously in these Houses, we have done a lot but there is a lot more to do.  I will mention our key priorities.  We are still not happy with the clinic accommodation for the three hub teams provided on HSE sites in Galway, Cork and Limerick.  To give the committee an idea of the situation, we have eight clinical staff in Galway.  From Monday to Thursday, inclusive, they have just one clinic room for eight staff, which obviously does not compute.  On Fridays, they have three rooms.  That is a big problem.  We have introduced video-enabled care but that does not meet the needs.  That is a major issue.<\/p><p> A national mother and baby unit is absolutely key because now, if a woman develops a severe mental health problem, a postpartum psychosis for example, and requires in-patient care in a mental health unit, she has to be separated from her baby.  That is very traumatic for the mother and I cannot even begin to describe the effects on the baby, which Dr. N&iacute; Longphuirt has already touched on.  The effects are not just immediate.  For the infant, they are lifelong and have an impact into adulthood.  We would like to develop support from perinatal psychiatrists through the spoke links by providing a ring-fenced perinatal psychiatry session for each spoke link.  With the funding we got from the national women and infants health programme, we are going to be able to do that in the Galway spokes.  Each of those four spokes will have a ring-fenced session.  The perinatal psychiatrist will be linked in to the liaison service, the perinatal mental health midwife, to provide supervision and advice to the psychiatrist, where necessary.  The psychiatrist will also provide a virtual second opinion for women attending the spoke sites.<\/p><p> The next slide brings us back to what this programme is all about, women and their infants.  We would like women to be aware that mental health problems are common during this period.  They affect up to one in five women during pregnancy or in the year after delivery.  They are not the women's fault and are not nothing to be ashamed of.  We would like women to be compassionate towards themselves and to seek help.  We have tried to reform the system but it is only part of the system.  As Dr. N&iacute; Longphuirt said, there are other parts that need to be developed, for example, primary care psychology.  However, we have tried to reform the system to meet the needs of women and their infants and to ensure that the services we provide are recovery-focused, imbued with hope, accessible to women and provided by skilled staff.  We hope the outcome will be an enhancement of resilience in women and the development of resilience in infants.  The mother-infant bond is the focus of the interventions we provide within the specialist perinatal mental health services.  That, in itself, will be of lifelong benefit for infants into childhood and, eventually, adulthood.  <\/p><p> The picture at the top of this slide shows a World Mental Health Day event the Limerick hub team organised in Castletroy Park Hotel last Monday.

I have been a consultant psychiatrist in perinatal psychiatry at the National Maternity Hospital for more than 26 years.  During this time, I have seen and been responsible for the care of more than 15,000 women, including those in health difficulties in pregnancy or in the postpartum period.  I previously addressed Oireachtas committees on the subject of perinatal mental health.  I addressed the citizens' assembly on the protection on life in pregnancy legislation.  I am an associate professor of psychiatry at UCD.  I am also an expert psychiatric assessor for the confidential inquiries into maternal deaths in Great Britain and Ireland.  I thank the committee for inviting all of us to address the members today.  Trying to fit my contribution into five minutes will be very difficult.  I completely agree with everything that has been said by the previous contributors.  I will try not to repeat was has already been stated.<\/p> <p>  The specialist perinatal mental health services are a vitally important component of our mental health services.  Why are they so important and necessary?  First, pregnancy, birth and the demands of new motherhood can be seriously challenging for any woman's mental health.  Second, a mother's mental health difficulties can have very significant negative impacts on obstetric outcomes and on the baby.  It works in both ways.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the challenges of pregnancy for women's mental health.  A mother is 19 times more likely to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the first six weeks after the birth of a baby than in any other six-week period in her whole life.  It is a particular window, but it does not stop there.  Post-natal depression affects 11% of all new mothers - which in one in nine - and is the commonest complication of pregnancy.  It is more common than infections, trauma or bleeding.  A psychotic illness post-delivery occurs in one in 500 mothers.  Although the image of mothers in pregnancy is often of women glowing and contented, in reality pregnancy is frequently an extremely challenging time for women's mental health.  Normal pregnancy can be very physically and emotionally demanding.  Any women in the room who have had babies will know all of this.  While having a child is joyful and meaningful too, many women may have to deal with miscarriage, still birth, haemorrhage or pre-eclampsia, not to mention complicated deliveries, traumatic deliveries, hormone changes, the demands of breast feeding and other complications and demands.  That is the physical side.<\/p> <p>  The psychological and social challenges of pregnancy are considerable for so many.  There are unplanned pregnancies, unwanted pregnancies, or the discovery of major abnormalities.  There are previous difficult pregnancy experiences and the woman is pregnant again or there have been pregnancy losses before.  There may be complications in relationships due to pregnancy or the massively significant increase in domestic violence associated with pregnancy: men are much more likely to be violent or have affairs when their partners are pregnant.  Previous psychological or psychiatric issues are frequently exacerbated by pregnancy, and very often new and seriously challenging issues, as listed above, present for the first time.  Previous mental health difficulties, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar illness, and post-traumatic stress disorder do not disappear in pregnancy and are often complicated by it and frequently worsen after it unless addressed and appropriately treated.  All of these pose considerable risks to the well-being and sometimes the safety of the mother, her baby, and her whole family.<\/p> <p>  The other side of it is that mental health difficulties affect pregnancy outcomes.  Mothers with significant mental health disorders frequently present differently to antenatal clinics, post-natal clinics and emergency rooms.  For example, those with depression, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc., are less likely to attend for appointments or scans and will therefore have issues missed.  Others with major anxiety disorders may present over-regularly and obsessively and may exhibit risky behaviours as a result.  I will list the latter afterwards.<\/p> <p>  Those with major mental health issues can struggle with adherence to advice regarding medication, whether it is for medical conditions such as diabetes in pregnancy, eating disorders in pregnancy, or hypertension in pregnancy, and they are less likely to take vaccines or psychotropic medication for their mental health disorders.  Similarly, advice around diet, baby care, and safety are sometimes more likely to be ignored, misunderstood or misinterpreted.<\/p> <p>  Women with mental health difficulties are also more likely to be victims of domestic violence and abuse.<\/p><p>There are increased rates of termination of pregnancy among women with mental health issues.  They are also more likely to have premature deliveries and instrumental deliveries, such as deliveries requiring forceps.  Caesarean sections and traumatic births are more likely.  It works in both ways: traumatic births can affect women's mental health and women with mental health difficulties are more likely to have traumatic births.  Again, it is circular and we must always address both sides.<\/p><p> At-risk behaviours are more common in women with mental health difficulties.  I refer to increased rates of smoking, drinking and drug abuse during pregnancy, possibly resulting in withdrawal syndromes among babies or foetal alcohol syndrome.  Women with eating disorders may have a very poor diet, be vomiting or use purgatives.  Those with anxiety may physically over-check their babies.  Women who are highly anxious about their babies not moving may press on their stomachs to check for movement, maybe at 3 a.m., 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.  After a baby is born, an anxious mother may wake it up constantly to check on it because she fears it will suffer a cot death.  Such mothers cannot deal with their anxiety or obsessional worries.  All of these issues are associated not just with obstetric complications but also with subsequent developmental and attachment issues, to which my psychology colleagues have been referring.<\/p><p> There are also the serious mental health issues leading to suicide and infanticide.  Suicide is the second most common cause of maternal death in the country, although it is still uncommon.  Despite many of the advances in obstetric care, it is still a huge issue.  Infanticide, while fortunately rare, is always a tragedy, and the rate is probably underestimated.<\/p><p> The other major mental illnesses that can present at this difficult, key time, including psychosis and depression, have all been shown on the slides.  Frequently, these can have lifelong effects, not just on the mother's mental health but also on that of the infants.  There can also be lifelong effects on the mother's relationship, her relationship with her baby and sometimes her relationship with other children.  She may never quite recover.<\/p><p> What are the functions of the perinatal mental service?  Dr. Wrigley has listed these already but I wish to flesh the subject out a little.  One function is to assess and advise women referred to the specialist mental health teams with mental health difficulties through pregnancy and the first year after birth.  Another function is to assess, diagnose and treat effectively those mothers with moderate to severe mental health problems through pregnancy and the first year after birth, and also to carry out expert risk assessments because the risks are huge.<\/p><p> Treatments may include psychological interventions, social interventions, psycho-education, parenting supports and skills training.  Also included are safe prescribing and advice on the safe prescribing of medication in pregnancy and after birth.  We do not stop treating people with major mental illnesses with their medication during pregnancy or if they are breast-feeding because the balance of risks is huge in such circumstances.  We must proceed safely and be able to give expert advice to mothers and psychiatry services throughout the country, certainly those in our spoke hospitals.<\/p><p> Treatments also include referring for psychiatric admission those mothers who are most at risk and in need of inpatient treatment.  As mentioned, the absence of a mother and baby unit for mothers who require admission is the single biggest deficit in our services.  We also make referrals to key community services, whether these involve primary care psychology, services in the voluntary sector, Barnardos, mothering skills supports and supports for mothers in the community.  We have to be experts.  Our social work team is very good at knowing who to refer to outside the hospital.<\/p><p> Assessment of risk also includes assessment of the mother&ndash;infant interaction.  That has been listed.  The team also gives pre-conceptual advice to those mothers with serious mental illness who are considering pregnancy.  That may be advice on mediation, or it might be advice for those who have had a traumatic experience or eating disorder.  We also provide specialist assessment and advice as per the requirements under the Termination of Pregnancy Act 2018.<\/p><p> I hope the importance of these issues is understood and appreciated.  We certainly understand and appreciate them.  The development of the specialist teams and services has represented a considerable advance in care.  We are so grateful to the HSE and the Department of Health for supporting all that.  Obviously, we need a mother and baby unit and would like to develop more support for smaller maternity units.  Obviously, we would also like to develop all the services my psychology colleagues referred to, including supports for infants, fathers and families, and to keep growing them.  The need is great.  The perinatal period is vital.  If it starts off well between mothers and babies, and families and babies, and if babies are securely attached at the beginning and their mothers are well, it is such an investment in the lifelong well-being of the children, their families and our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Anthony McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.

For example, reference was made to eating disorders and how they interact with perinatal mental health.  For everybody here, one of our questions would be about how good we are at identifying two intersecting issues and providing the right kind of care in such instances.  As well as eating disorders, there is the question of how the issue we are discussing may affect particular cohorts, such as Travellers, who might have particular mental health issues.  Another example is people living in consistent poverty, who may have particular requirements, as well as members of new communities in Ireland.  There was also reference to people with ADHD and those kinds of issues.  How do we deal with that?  What about issues around disability?  I refer not just to women who have disabilities themselves and obviously have tonnes of challenges and mental requirements of their own, but also women who give birth and it becomes obvious immediately, as is my own experience, that a serious disability is in play for the child.<\/p> <p>  I have included a lot in that question, for which I apologise.

I have been reading some of the research on this and it seems to be very common that people would not necessarily hide their illness but they may underplay it during a pregnancy because they are worried they might be identified as problematic.  I am trying to get a sense of when such people are identified.  Is it at the 20-week scan?  Are people being encouraged to talk about having an eating disorder, say, or something else that is happening in the woman's life, such as disability or ADHD?  Are we encouraging a moment where women could say to their caregivers, \"This is an issue for me and I need support\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#J00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":586,"content":"<p>In the hospital, there is no particular time at which this might happen.  People can be referred at five weeks into their pregnancy.  Some women who come to the antenatal clinic are asked some woolly questions, which may be an opportunity to raise such issues.  Their weight will be taken.  Many women with eating disorders have excessive vomiting during pregnancy.  Unfortunately, vomiting is a very normal part of pregnancy for lots of women and they often have different patterns of vomiting.  When somebody presents with vomiting, people are thinking about weight issues.  It sometimes depends on the woman coming forth with the issue and, very often, women with eating disorders have recovered to become pregnant.  Many will have recovered to a certain extent, which is how they are able to get pregnant.  Those with severe anorexia cannot get pregnant because ovarian function switches off.<\/p> <p>  For many, there is an opportunity for such issues to be raised and they start to worry about that.  They may admit they are taking laxatives.  They might begin to talk about it or sometimes we or the dieticians pick it up.  We cannot say we always pick it up but we often do.  The women are then referred to us.  We have a number of patients we are seeing who are also, for instance, seeing eating disorder teams elsewhere.  It comes up in all sorts of different ways.  The Deputy raised a question as to whether there is a direct pathway for that.  The system certainly could be improved but the issues involved present the same difficulties as with every issue.

We are all aware our disability services are understaffed and it depends on the service and the team whether it has the space, training or opportunity to pick up on parental wellbeing.  Sometimes the disability services look to primary care psychology to pick up that piece.  Primary care psychology may receive a referral to support parents who have come into the disability service with a child who is seriously unwell and has significant disabilities and to help them through that.

I also want to acknowledge the hard work my team has done.<\/p> <p>  All options are being looked at for the mother and baby unit.  For example, when the Minister of State, Deputy Butler visited The Coombe earlier this year, she was told a unit was being closed and she asked us whether we wanted to develop the mother and baby unit there.  The problem was that a mother and baby unit, which is a national unit, has specific requirements.  It must be on a site where mental health doctors are on duty 27-7; near an approved centre; and where maternity services are available on the ground.  Services for mother and baby must both be available on the ground, so we thanked her but told her it was not ideal or not where we want it to be.  Options have been looked at.  St. Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park is a site we have recommended as it has an acute mental health unit, maternity services and all of that.  The challenge with that site is there are two options.  One is to build on a third floor site along with an eating disorder unit in that facility.  The second option is to build it on a green field site in the unit and now people are discussing the possibility of putting the new maternity hospital on the same site.<\/p> <p>  We are between those, but we are engaging with the estates department in the HSE to see what will fulfil our needs because this is a once-off opportunity and we want ensure we can stand over what we develop and say this is delivering exactly what we are looking for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Amir Niazi"},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Dr. Niazi raised the issue of the two sites in April 2022.

We started with just four whole-time equivalents and we now have 74 staff in place.  With the passage of time, staff leave and we are able to fill posts as well.  The person to explain this is my colleague, Ms Fiona O'Riordan, but she is not here.  The voluntary hospitals do their own recruitment so we cannot take any credit for that.  Ms O'Riordan is a master at working with the national recruitment service to recruit staff.  We have been able to develop bespoke competitions say, for instance, for mental health nurses, psychology, occupational therapy and social work.  We have developed those panels.  The staff then know that they are not applying for one massive situation where any job can come up but are applying for posts in perinatal mental health.  That initiative has been helpful.<\/p> <p>  We have had to work on things like having job descriptions that are clear so once staff come they know that not only are they working in an area that is lovely to work in but it is also a workplace where there is a lot of training and support provided for them.  For instance, with the psychologist that came on board, we provided supervision from the UK because we do not have that expertise within the country although we are nearly there.  We provided monthly supervision for a period of a year for our own six senior psychologists working for perinatal mental health.  When one wraps it all up together as a package, it encourages recruitment.<\/p> <p>  The clinical programmes are attractive areas for staff to work in because they know that they will get a wraparound support when they come in to a clinical programme.

I will make some comments because many of the questions have been answered.  If there is something the witnesses want to take up in that regard, I am happy to hear it.  I found both presentations had different emphases and were quite evocative.  Sometimes you think you have processed losses and suddenly you get ambushed when people start discussing some of the issues.  I found myself very moved and touched by that.<\/p> <p>  A point I have made at meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health is that I am very struck by the difference in approaches in Scotland and in Ireland to healthcare generally.  The Scots seem to adopt, ever since the foundation of the National Health Service, this concept of having an embracing health service.  We have a health service that to some degree likes to keep things at arm's length, which is a pity and that is a necessary step change.  I am thinking about immigrants, towards whom Dr. Doyle gestured, who do not have granny and grandad or the aunts and uncles and that support network that translates into childcare, and it translates into so many aspects of their lives.  For example, it translates, as we know, into the ability to go back into study or to take on work etc.  In this particular area, it is an especially acute loss.<\/p> <p>  I am a psychotherapist by training and some of my favourite clients were pregnant women or women who had lost their pregnancies or miscarried.  One of the things that would have caused me to reflect was the awesomeness of the whole pregnancy piece.  To me, depression, as opposed to clinical depression, is quite understandable and a logical conclusion when a woman has carried by herself a growing baby and the awesome responsibility of that.  Then there is the great birth event, but the baby is no longer part of the mother, and that represents a loss, I imagine.  The idea of being depressed and feeling a sense of loss and dislocation makes an awful lot of sense to me but can be news to a mum.  About 20 years ago I spent two weeks in hospital, and I remember on the journey back home feeling this sense of complete isolation because I had become very used very quickly to the institutionalisation and the care of nurses, and now I was on my own to care for myself and what if something happened?  Multiply that by an infinite amount with a mother who is coming home with such a fragile delicate piece of life.  Perhaps the witnesses would like to comment.  Maybe somebody can note it and come back on that issue of the speed of the turnaround of pregnancy in hospital.  It seems to be really quick in terms of delivery and then home.  I do not know what the witnesses' views are on that.  If I was a mum I think I would find it quite scary being in care and surrounded by professional care, even for a very short period, and then I am back home.  A lot of this comes back to the rights of the child, and maybe that should be the point from which we start, once they are born.  Obviously, there are the rights of the child in the womb in terms of being a caring environment and reflecting that, but it is just that turnaround period I am thinking of.<\/p> <p>  I am probably one of few politicians who have read John Bowlby's books on attachment, separation and loss.  I know when we talk about attachment, people often think of that clinging behaviour.<\/p><p>One of my favourite images is of the baby crawling out of the room and exploring, and then going back in to check.  The certainty that the parent and caregiver is there allows the baby to explore further.  It is one of my favourite images of attachment.  I ask the witnesses to address the issue of the turnaround time.<\/p><p> When I hear our guest use the words \"mental health\", there is a voice screaming in my head that we would be better to use the term \"well-being\".  There is still a stigma attached to it.  I would welcome their views in that regard.  <\/p><p> I was interested in the witnesses' remarks on facilities.  I visited the new children's hospital satellite in Tallaght, which is in my constituency.  The health committee was fortunate enough to go there to see the developments in the new children's hospital.  I was struck by the lengths that have been gone to, even in the satellite hospital, in terms of  things such as the scent.  The place does not have the classic hospital scent.  Quite a bit of work has been done in that regard.  Children had a significant input into the environment, art, colour scheme and all those kinds of things.<\/p><p> My next point is for Professor McCarthy of the National Maternity Hospital.  Breast-feeding is a significant issue when it is encountered by professionals in terms of the lack of support and the sense of guilt or failure that some women may feel.  They find it quite difficult to overcome that.<\/p><p> I refer to the mother's environment or the environment in the room.  I ask Professor McCarthy to develop that theme as well.  I refer to housing or the lack thereof.  Anxiety and distress are experienced by women who are living in cramped conditions or on a housing list while pregnant.  In some cases, they are coming home from hospital not to their own home but to a shared home environment.  Some women are not lucky enough to even have that.  I liked the fact that Professor McCarthy outlined that the National Maternity Hospital is clear about the functions of specialist perinatal mental services.  The witnesses will all have a chance to respond when I have finished my questions.<\/p><p> Moving on to the PSI, I refer to the first year of care.  We know the damage that is caused by separating infants from their primary caregivers.  Do we still not do that well?<\/p><p> Going back to the needs of the child, the PSI in its written submission states: \"We must learn from our history of separation and move towards combined care that supports early relationships between caregiver and baby.\"  Where are we in that regard?  That sentence arrested me.  It made me wonder whether we are not a million miles away from the awful stuff that we read about.<\/p><p> There are one or two new primary care centres in my constituency.  I like the idea of it being the model but the staffing issue in that regard is quite tricky, even in terms of GPs, never mind any of the specialist pieces.<\/p><p> Dads do not get a big mention.  There is a gesture towards dads.  It is like there is a picture of a helpless onlooker.  There could have been more emphasis on moving from that to a really supportive role.  What is the PSI's view in that regard?<\/p><p> There is the piece in respect of being out of control.   Professor McCarthy made the point that suicide is the highest cause of maternal death.  He referred to maternal death rather than women's death.  I ask him to develop that point as I did not understand it fully.<\/p><p> I will finish on the point relating to the health system in Scotland.  Dr. N&iacute; Longphuirt urged the committee \"to invite in the infant, the mother and the family\".  What do our guests think we actually do?  What is the chasm?  That is food for thought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#S00200","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>There were plenty of interesting questions there.  The Deputy is an unusual politician in that he has read Bowlby.<\/p><p>I am an unusual psychiatrist in that I trained as a psychoanalytical psychotherapist and a cognitive analytical therapist.  I have read Bowlby as well.<\/p><p> We could talk all day about the baby being inside or outside, whether is it lonely and that separation issue that was mentioned, but it is especially important that we see an individual mother.  For some mothers, when the baby is inside, they feel that it is safe in there.  When the baby comes out, they are terrified or worried or there is a sense of loss.  For others, they feel completely out of control with the baby inside and want the baby out so they can hold it.  A mother who has lost a baby before from a stillbirth or miscarriage wants that baby out.  Some women are desperately attached to the baby inside.  Some are not because they have three other children and people are telling them they should be attached, but they do not have time.  Those women know that once the baby is born and they have a few weeks of sleep and toast and tea, they will love their baby in the long run.  Everybody is different and it is desperately important to deal with the individual mother and not think that this is traumatic.  It is about what is the issue for this particular woman with her history, circumstances and family, etc.<\/p><p> The Deputy made a reference to clinical depression to being almost normal.  To be challenged by birth is very normal.  All of the experiences are demanding.  Some 60% of mothers are struggling.  When we use the term \"post-natal depression\" for 11% of women, that is a very useful label simply to highlight that it is a serious time of struggle for so many women.  Post-natal depression is not a thing.  It is a very useful label that says, \"This is a struggling time.\"  Some women are depressed, anxious, distressed, adjusting, traumatised or have had a very difficult birth experience.  For the majority of those women who are depressed, it is understandable depression, not clinical depression but it triggers clinical depression in some women.  One of our jobs in terms of risk assessment is to ask if it is the normal depression everybody has had at different times in their lives if they are sensate human beings who have any cop on and life experiences versus clinical depression that we need to address.  Understanding the difference is important.<\/p><p> On speed of delivery and leaving hospital, some women cannot wait to get out.  They did not want to be in there for the birth in the first place and they want to get home, and that is a good place.  Others want to get out because they are terrified and anxious; that is a sign of something else.  For still others, they could benefit from the support in the hospital and, yes, because the wards are very overstretched, they are leaving earlier than they should and things are missed because of that.  Again, it is always about looking at the individual person in front of us.<\/p><p> We could talk about mental health versus well-being until the cows come home.  It is sometimes a bit like changing the name of the Windscale nuclear reactor.  You can change the names, but at the end of the day, there will be a lifelong issue regarding how to name normal mental distress and difficulty and not stigmatise that versus recognising that sometimes it has moved into a situation where someone's brain is in trouble.  In one person stress gives them an ulcer, in somebody else it makes their eczema or psoriasis come out or their immune system crash, and sometimes stress and challenges get into the brain and create a brain problem.  It is about trying to find labels that are going to catch that accurately without stigmatising or making people react to it.  I would love the time to come when people will recognise that it is not just equivalent to physical health difficulties, but equally important and valuable, and we will not get hung up about the approach to it;, we will just want to make it better, rather than worrying about stigmas. Within the five minutes we had today, I would have loved to talk about dads.  When I first started in the National Maternity Hospital 26 years ago, my wife's first question was, \"Will you do anything for dads?\" I said, \"Oh my God, the services for women are so appalling, I am just starting.  Dads are going to have to wait\".  They are a hugely important part.  We see dads frequently and accessing and supporting them is also a key part.  We should have much more resources for them.<\/p><p> I will finally deal with maternal death.  There is a difference with a death caused by birth.  This classification occurs in the first six weeks after the birth or within the first year - there are different classifications.  The second most common reason a mother died during the first year after birth last year was suicide.  It varies from year to year.  There have been years where in Britain and Ireland suicide was the most common cause, but it is always one of the top two or three causes of maternal death.  That is a death within the first year after the birth of the baby.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Anthony McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I agree with everything Professor McCarthy said.  I do not want to repeat anything others have said.<\/p><p>On the questions about dads, we are seeing LGBT+ people and families who do not look like the traditional family more often in the health service.  The other piece is having a service and training that allows the clinicians working with people to feel competent, able and resourced.  We have Dads, Mums, Moms and many people who go by lots of different labels and it is important we learn how to provide those people with a good service.<\/p><p> Two issues we were talking about come to mind in respect of the combined care of the mother and the infant.  The perinatal services could do more both structurally and with the staff we have to be accessible to infants and mums.  We are working in portacabins.  We have a lack of spaces and are not able to see all of the different pieces that need to be seen.  In our statement we mentioned the idea of infant mental health practitioners and what we mean is practitioners who can work with the dyad - mums and infants or dads and infants together - to ensure the early relationship is nurtured.<\/p><p> The other piece relates to when children move from the neonatal intensive care unit, NICU, to the paediatric intensive care unit, PICU, for example from the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin when they are very sick.  If their mother is still in the maternity hospital, they are separated.  The fact that those resources are in separate hospitals has a major impact on the mother's ability to visit her infant.  That was exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic when parents were separated from their infants and were not able to visit them.  That happens within hospitals sometimes because it can be difficult for staff to support parents to visit their child in the NICU and to be present when the child is feeding or at other crucial points so they can realise the role of being a parent from the start, no matter how sick their infant might be.  Again staff training on that subject is required, but the co-location of hospitals also has a major impact on parents when their child is very sick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eithne N&iacute; Longphuirt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I will pick up on a few points.<\/p> <p>  As regards well-being and mental health, when I am working with people, I often think I am initially treating their mental health.  An absence of a mental health difficulty does not necessarily mean people are feeling well or are happy with their quality of life.  I am always trying to think about how to work with both and help people build a life they feel is worth living that gives them joy and contentment.  We need both because that helps them access their threat or \"fight or flight\" system in a way that helps them live their life in a way that is beneficial.  We do not want to get rid of the ability to detect danger or to respond to threat, but we want people to be able to move out of it when appropriate and to access support and resources that nourish them.<\/p> <p>  It is important for people from other countries who have come to this country to be able to access supports.  One of the supports we can provide therapeutically is group work.  I feel a bit like Oliver Twist asking for more because we have some clinical space in the Rotunda Hospital, but not enough and none of us has access to group rooms.  Groups are important for mental health.  If I had a magic wand, I would make a nice baby-friendly group-room where we can get down on the floor.  Babies do not like to sit on chairs.  Small babies cannot sit on chairs and it can be hard for a mother to have to keep her baby in a buggy for an hour.  Babies are good communicators and it can impede the mother's communication if her baby is crying.<\/p> <p>  We also do not have baby changing facilities in our fancy portacabins.  That is a practical issue.  A mother needs to have easy access to a toilet and baby changing facilities.  We were talking about bricks and mortar.  That is what we need to help people access services.<\/p> <p>  Thinking about becoming a mother, matrescence or the journey towards motherhood, happens throughout pregnancy and in the perinatal period.<\/p><p>We become mothers throughout the life span of our children.  A woman is learning a new part of this identity of being a mother in each milestone of development.  When Deputy Lahart spoke about that, I thought about teenagers, whom we highlighted in our report.  It can be difficult being a teenage mum.  The people in your social circle are not going through the same experience as you, so who do you have to bounce this developing identity off?  It is an opportunity to bring that to the fore again, that these young women, these mothers, really need our support and our help.<\/p><p> When Deputy Lahart talked about turnaround speed, I thought about trauma-informed care.  Some women would very much appreciate an extra few nights in hospital, but some women want to get home to their family as soon as possible.  That is one of the things over which we need to give the woman control.  What works best for them, what works best for their family and how do we support that?  Community midwives have such an important role to play where women are maybe leaving hospital faster than would have happened historically, and of course there are the public health nurses for continuity of care.<\/p><p> It would be amazing to have accommodation that does not smell like a clinic or hospital and that is baby-friendly.  On accommodation, we are seeing people coming into our services who are living in really difficult circumstances.  In the Rotunda we have people coming from direct provision centres where a woman may have come through unspeakable trauma and is now living in a place she feels is not ideal for her and her circumstances and she does not know where she will be going next.  The importance of giving people certainty cannot be overlooked when we are thinking about how to make someone feel safe.  If you do not feel safe, how can you help your baby feel safe?  Something I always think about when someone is referred to me is where they are living.  That is the starting point.  If we go back to the basic hierarchy of needs, we need to make sure someone has somewhere to live where they feel safe.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned people feeling out of control.  Thinking about birth trauma, oftentimes if someone has an experience of birth trauma, they are left feeling very out of control and very disempowered.  It is a very important function of all our services to give a woman back control and to educate her antenatally about what is going to happen.  This involves giving education around babies and what it is like to have a baby, that women might feel depressed and overwhelmed, and where that goes from being normal to abnormal.  It is also helping someone think about the fact there is a point during birth where they are out of control because the body takes over, and in our society we are so in our heads and we want to know and to be in control.  This is probably the most in your body experience a person will go through.  It is a case of trying to explore what it is like for them when they are out of control and how we help them to stay with themselves in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jillian Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I hope my colleagues have answered to Deputy Lahart's satisfaction many of the points he brought up.  One area I would like to mention in the context of the early discharge after a day in hospital is the small but nevertheless very important number of women, probably around 120 per year, who develop postnatal psychosis, which is a very serious mental illness.  I use the word \"illness\" in this context.  That occurs typically within days or so of birth, and if a woman is out of the hospital within a day, it may be that it does not happen when she is in the maternity service but it may happen when she is at home and she has less support.  Where there has been a previous episode of postnatal psychosis, obviously there is very careful surveillance kept specifically by the perinatal service mental health services to make sure the woman gets the care she needs.<\/p><p>If it is a first episode of postnatal psychosis, it can be a very worrisome time for women.  It is something I am aware of because women are only staying in hospital for a short time after giving birth.<\/p><p> There has been some discussion of terminology with regard to mental health problems, including terms like \"mental illness\", \"psychiatric illness\" and \"well-being\".  I will make a general comment on the difficulty we experience in that regard.  Dr. Niazi would experience this more than me in his current role.  While people are much freer about saying they feel unwell mentally and talking about feeling anxious and depressed and so on, when you are talking about people who have severe and enduring mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, there is not as much of an acceptance of that.  The acceptance needs to be there so that it is followed by an impetus to develop services to meet patients' needs.  That needs funding as well.

I also want to ask about the performance indicators we put in place for the various programmes.  I know every person in clinical care knows about the importance of compiling data on these issues, but compared to other jurisdictions are we doing well in terms of gathering data when, as we have just been discussing, people sometimes will not be forthcoming about their difficulties?  It was mentioned that we might not always record particular deaths or instances correctly.

What we are working off at the moment are Excel sheets.  Essentially, we are looking at who comes in and who goes out.  It is a completely inadequate system and we have been working on it since we started.  Dr. Niazi has been wonderful in supporting us in trying to get a bespoke data system.  We would like it to have a unique patient identifier number, obviously without knowing the patient's name, so that we could follow the patient's clinical pathway from start to finish.  This would enable us to know how and why they came in, what sort of help was provided for them and by whom, what sort of an outcome they had and, very importantly, what they thought about what they were offered by the service.  We were making some headway with that until the cyberattack happened and then progress went backwards.<\/p><p>Due to the concern about a further cyberattack, a tight process is in place and we are not allowed to look at a bespoke data system at all.  We are looking at alternatives and most recently, as Dr. Niazi knows, we set up a little subcommittee within our perinatal world to look at the data we are collecting and refine it.  We now have a link in with the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre in University College Cork.  It already collects data for the national women and infants health programme on things like perinatal deaths, brain cooling and so on and because it is already involved with the HSE, we can use the centre.  We hope to be able to provide better data but we will still not be able to provide the unique patient identifier and, therefore, it is still not enough.  We absolutely need that because unless we have data like that, we do not know whether we are doing the right thing or not.  We hope we are.  We talk to women and we have a project in place where we will get feedback from women.  Parts of the system like the Coombe Women's Hospital did a study looking at feedback from women accessing their perinatal mental health service,  but we need to have a whole-system view of it so we can get exactly that data.

The self-harm programme, which works with the National Office of Suicide Prevention, had its own needs as did the perinatal programme working on women's health.  We tried to put all of those needs together and to look for a system that could collect those data.  Money was even allocated for us to go out and buy the software to develop our own data system and then when the cyberattack happened, we were told that the HSE was currently using approximately 2,000 different types of software in different parts of the country on different programmes.  Everything was halted.  We were told that the skeleton system, the integrated community case management system, ICCMS, which will use the unique identifier number, was being developed and when that system was in place, the 2,000 different types of software would have to be looked at as regards speaking to the main skeleton.

One of her conclusions, which she laments, is that the Spanish flu occurred in a period of revolution towards the end of the First World War and people did not want to know or talk too about it much.  As such, we forgot about it as a society and, as Dr. Milne wrote, did not memorialise it.  Memorials take many different manifestations.<\/p><p>I sense an appetite in Ireland to try to move on from Covid very quickly.  It looks as though we could have more than another pandemic in our lifetime and we are not completely free of this one.<\/p><p> All Deputies heard heartbreaking, heart-wrenching and awful stories about dads or partners waiting in a car outside the prenatal clinic and not being present at labour.  What have we learned?  Where can we learn about that?  The papers have not been written about this yet.  This is not about looking for headlines to point the finger of blame but, if in ten years' we had another pandemic that necessitated interventions such as those we have just had, what could our prenatal and postnatal care system have learned?  Was the response proportionate in hindsight?  How would we do it again?  Part of that paper, whenever it is written, is about acknowledging the awful trauma experienced by mothers and their partners and, equally, the trauma of the nurses and nurse managers who had to say \"We are sorry\".  I am sure they put up with considerable abuse and trauma.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#AA01100","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666047600,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Someone rang me about getting advice from public health nurses around partners.

There are best practice standards from the UK but I would have to find them.  I do not want to misquote them.  One of the foremost pieces is around training and awareness and upskilling staff with regard to LGBT+, in particular.  That does not just mean the perinatal teams.  All of the staff in maternity hospitals need support and training, because there will be more and more people from that community who need to be supported and to be treated equally, yet differently.  They have had disproportionate amounts of mental health difficulties and suicidality, by comparison with the general population, and all of the research says they have had difficulties accessing health services in general in this country and internationally.  We need to care for that population but the foremost piece is around training and support of staff as a start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022101800002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eithne N&iacute; Longphuirt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666047600,"counter":728,"content":"<p>A number of us who were working within the mental health programmes during the first year of the pandemic in 2020, including Dr. Niazi, got together to write a paper on the psychological impact of pandemics and specifically Covid.  There were very little data from the flu epidemic after the First World War, or the Spanish flu as it was called.  However, there is considerable information on the subsequent SARS pandemic in south-east Asia, in particular.  The paper talks about a tsunami in the later stages of the pandemic.  After getting over the physical aspects, there can be a tsunami of psychological impacts of the pandemic.  This is not well recognised but has certainly been documented in previous pandemics.  There is evidence of such an impact now.  I do not know of any work that was done but we were very keen, within the mental health programmes, to flag it rather than have people say the pandemic is done and dusted and we do not need to worry.  Many people are still suffering.<\/p><p>We see this business of coronaphobia and being afraid to go out all around us and in our own families.  It is a very real phenomenon.

Some of the more qualitative research on the pandemic has talked about uncertainty and the impact that has had on women, that is, uncertainty about what services would be provided for them; whether they would be lucky to see a month where restrictions had been lifted; whether restrictions would be lifted in the hospital they were to be in; and whether their partner would be able to come in and for how long.  Such uncertainty has had a considerable impact on women.<\/p> <p>  As people who provide a service, we have seen a much higher influx of postnatal women accessing our services, many of whom will say they do not leave their house except to come to the service or that it is their first time and their beginning.  It happens less than it did a year ago but it absolutely happens.<\/p> <p>  We talked about infant mental health.  There are women who worry about their infants and whether the lack of community involvement in those first few years has had an impact on their two- or three-year-old.  It can be very hard to decipher whether it has had an impact and what we are looking at.  People need support.  There has been a considerable increase in anxiety.

We are all learning and continue to learn.  The evidence base will keep changing.  We had a recent support meeting in Holles Street hospital about Covid.  Our clinical director was describing how when Covid hit in March 2020, he was having to tell staff they must come into work in our beautiful and old, but cramped, building which was designed for 2,000 pregnancies per year but actually has 9,000, while thinking that if Italian figures were to go through that between 35 and 45 of the staff in the hospital would die.<\/p> <p>  Medical staff often die in pandemics.  If one looks at pandemics all over the world, medical, nursing and other staff die.  I was past retirement age but I was going into the hospital, as were many others.  We were very aware of the risk to ourselves.  We were also very aware of the risk to the mothers.  We were doing everything possible in our cramped building.  The Deputy mentioned there may be another pandemic within ten years.  I hope the new national maternity hospital is in St. Vincent's hospital within ten years where we will have single rooms at that stage and will be able to allow dads in.<\/p> <p>  We were very aware of the safety of the mothers.  Can we win?  We did not want to give Covid to mothers and we certainly did not want to give Covid to babies.  It was pre-vaccines.  We were aware of how dangerous it would be in pregnancy for mothers who were not vaccinated.  We did not have vaccines yet.  We were worried about ourselves in that context but, more important, we were worried about the mothers and the babies.  We do not want even more court cases with people suing the hospital for giving Covid to a mother because we did not protect them well enough.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic has had all sorts of effects.  Many mothers and parents missed out.  Some were thankful that there would not be loads of husbands, partners, grannies and others and that they would have their own space.  Others were delighted to go home and not have family visiting all the time.
