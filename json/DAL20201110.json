As Members will be aware, it is a long-established ruling of this House that members of the Judiciary are independent, by virtue of the Constitution, and may not be criticised or have their rulings referred to in the House, except on foot of a substantive motion.  Without prejudice to how this matter may proceed, I must point out that Members of this House are in a different position from others in the context of commentary insofar as they may ultimately have to adjudicate on the matter in accordance with the Constitution, legislation and Standing Orders.  Any such adjudication must be carried out in a manner that conforms with the principles of basic fairness of procedures and the requirements of natural and constitutional justice.  It is crucial, therefore, that Members do not comment on the matter, either on the floor of the House or elsewhere, in such a way as could give rise to a perception of bias because this could act as a serious impediment to their ability to discharge their important constitutional functions, if so required, in the future.  Accordingly, I ask Members to exercise the utmost care in any comments they may make on the correspondence and the issues arising and I request their full co-operation in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000008#H00100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1605018900,"counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000008#H00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1605018900,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I am sure the Taoiseach will join with me in sending our sympathies to the Palestinian people on the loss of Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who died this morning.

The world is a poorer place for the loss of him.<\/p>  <p>  Joe Biden was elected as the next President of the United States on Saturday last.  Mr. Biden's election is good for Ireland in many ways.  He is, as we know, proud of his Irish roots and he is, without doubt, a long-standing friend of Ireland.  During the presidential election campaign and throughout his time in office, he has acted to promote and protect peace, progress and the Good Friday Agreement.  He comes to the office of President at a time of threat from the British Government, with both Brexit and the refusal to honour agreements looming large.  The President-elect and both parties in Congress have made clear that there will be no trade agreement with Britain unless the Good Friday Agreement is safeguarded in all of its parts.<\/p>  <p>  The election of Joe Biden has, I believe, the potential to reshape the nature of the Brexit negotiation, particularly with regard to the aggressive and arrogant approach taken by the Tory Government and Boris Johnson to Irish interests.  Throughout this process, Tories have actively sought to undermine the Good Friday Agreement and, most recently, Mr. Johnson has played a reckless game by using as a bargaining chip the protection secured for Ireland as part of the withdrawal agreement.  Central to this game-playing has been Mr. Johnson's dangerous Internal Market Bill.  The latter undermines protections that are absolutely vital to ensuring there will be no reimposition of a hard border on our island, safeguarding the all-island economy and protecting the Good Friday Agreement and our hard-won peace.  The recklessness of this Bill is such that even the House of Lords last night voted to strip out powers that would allow Tory Ministers to break international law.<\/p> <p>Instead of preparing for an end to the transition period, Mr. Johnson used the smoke and mirrors of this Bill to sow confusion and mistrust in negotiations.  Perhaps this was an effort to buy time to see where the chips landed in the US election.  Now that election is over and in President-elect Biden, Ireland and the EU negotiating team have a very formidable ally, one who has already impressed upon the British Prime Minister that playing fast and loose with the future of this island simply will not be tolerated.  It is time for Mr. Johnson to realise that the best way forward for all of us, including Britain, is to engage in what remains of negotiations in good faith, to respect international law and their agreements.  A very necessary first step is that the British Government drop its dangerous internal market Bill.<\/p> <p> Throughout the Brexit process, it has been critical to defending Ireland's interests that we have spoken as one.  I believe this unified approach in the D&aacute;il has yielded much success and I believe this is how we must proceed as we enter the Brexit endgame because the decisions made in the closing stages of negotiations will have ramifications for years, indeed, for generations, to come.

I share that sympathy with all in that organisation and those of his loved ones.<\/p>  <p>  We are particularly pleased that President-elect Joe Biden has won the confidence of the American people.  It is an outstanding personal mandate - the largest ever in the history of US presidential elections.  It is fair to say he is the most Irish of Irish-American presidents since John F. Kennedy.  During the campaign, he nailed his colours to the mast in terms of his absolute commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and to the upholding of the Good Friday Agreement, and to his resistance to any measures, mechanisms or developments that would undermine the Good Friday Agreement and peace on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, fundamentally the negotiations that have been under way for quite some time between the EU and the United Kingdom are ones that, in our view, must yield a sensible outcome, which is a comprehensive free trade agreement without any tariffs or quotas that would limit the damage of Brexit to jobs, the Irish economy, the UK economy and the European economy.  Given the enormous negative impact that Covid-19 has had on our economy and on jobs, the last thing that our respective economies need is a second seismic shock via a no-deal Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the decision of the House of Lords last evening on the internal market Bill.  The talks have intensified over the past week or so and they are at a crucial point.  We would like to see an outcome to those talks on the basis of a deal being arrived at and that deal, essentially, then would lead to the neutralisation of the offending clauses of the internal market Bill and strict adherence to the protocol and to the withdrawal agreement because those are international treaties that the UK Government signed up to and that the British Parliament approved of.  In our view, the EU was correct in taking infringement action against the UK in respect of those legislative proposals.<\/p>  <p>  The key end objective for Ireland is that the future relationship between the UK and Europe would be a progressive one that has solid foundations that could lead to a fruitful engagement into the future, but, above all, one that would protect jobs and protect our economy.  That is our objective.  I intend to consult party members.  We met last week on related matters.  We discussed Brexit and the implications for the operation of the protocol.  I believe there were constructive discussions on the protocol in the joint committee over the past while and important progress was made.<\/p> <p>I am conscious that the First Minister and deputy First Minister have written to us about the issue of Northern Ireland goods' access to the European Union free trade agreements.  That is something that has been raised with us by stakeholders as well.  A joint letter has been received from the First Minister and deputy First Minister on practical arrangements around the application of certain aspects of the protocol.  Those practical solutions are being explored by the United Kingdom and the European Union to address specific concerns regarding some specific supply chains from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.

There are many issues on which the Oireachtas will divide, that is in the nature of our system and of our political differences, which are honestly held, but on this issue, and particularly since the edifice of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process itself cannot be disrupted, undermined or weakened in any way, that it is absolutely essential we act as one.

It is becoming one of the longest strikes in Irish labour history.  My colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, raised this issue with the Taoiseach last week and the Taoiseach acknowledged that the talks in the WRC did not deliver a solution.  The Taoiseach said something has to be done.  Regardless of political affiliation, I think we all agree that something has to be done because this cannot go on.  What the workers are looking for is very just: a fair redundancy.  That is the cornerstone of this fight.  Many TDs, of all political affiliations, have visited the picket line and the workers want to see a solution.  They want to see a meaningful settlement to which they are entitled.  Some of the workers worked for the company for decades.<\/p> <p>They feel as though they have been robbed by their employer and they feel let down by the State.  This should never have happened.  If we look back at what happened in Clerys, the Government should have implemented the Duffy Cahill report and this should never have happened.<\/p> <p> A solution can be found at this late stage.  This could go on indefinitely and we want to see a settlement by the Government.  The Taoiseach can intervene personally.  Sometimes the last people to get paid as creditors are the workers themselves.  They are the people who made all of that money in the first place so it is a terrible injustice.  The Government can waive the fees that are owed to the State, which could accumulate up to &euro;20 million.  To sort out the strike would cost between &euro;12 million and &euro;14 million.  The Government has the power to waive these fees with regard to final settlements.  The strike has to end, and it will end, but it has to end with workers feeling they have not been robbed.  That is very important.  They should not be robbed and they feel they have to have a settlement.  This could go on forever.  It is in the Taoiseach's power to intervene in this personally and end the strike as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000010#K00400","speaker":"1565","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605019800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the Debenhams workers.  It is very difficult and unsatisfactory from the workers' perspective that it has dragged on for so long and they have not received their redundancy entitlements as per the collective agreement they entered into with their employer.  The Government will, of course, honour the statutory redundancy but that is not the issue at stake.  The recent exploratory talks at the Workplace Relations Commission ended without agreement.  The Ministers of State, Deputies English and Troy, jointly chaired a forum with the social partners on 4 November to discuss the legislative provisions that deal with redundancy and insolvency from a company law and employment law perspective.  I am already on the record of the House saying we need to change the legislative situation, particularly in terms of liquidations and the parity and status given to collective agreements.  That in itself may not be of much use to the workers here and now in the current situation.<\/p>  <p>  I am not quite clear regarding what the Deputy said about the Government waiving fees but I take it he might be referring to State agencies or arms of the State that stand to get something from the liquidation, such as Revenue or the Department of Social Protection.  The challenge facing the Government in situations such as this is the creation of a precedent for other situations.  We do not want a situation emerging whereby the Government on an ongoing basis picks up the tab for rogue employers or, indeed, for employers who never honour their commitments irrespective.  The legislative framework is fairly clear in this regard.  That said, we have not stopped looking at ways of seeing whether we can be of some assistance here, notwithstanding the legal constraints.  A liquidation takes place within a legal framework and it is not that simple or easy for the Government to just waive the legal issues to one side and intervene in a manner that could ultimately create a precedent that would allow other employers to get off the hook from their obligations.  I do not think anybody in the House wants that either.  We are supportive of the best outcome possible for the workers but the issue is trying to get the mechanism to secure that.

Of course, there are rogue employers but there are some good employers as well and some very good workers.

Essentially, that means creating a new statutory redundancy scheme in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>way and simply saying the State will pick up the tab anyway, which would then incentivise employers to prioritise other issues for themselves and other creditors.

It is the part of the supply chain that plans, controls and implements the efficient and effective flow of goods and services from the point of origin to the point of consumption to meet the customer's requirements.  That is not contained within the IMDO document.  It is called the Irish Maritime Development Office but there is no development within this review - none.  What we are doing is trying to replace an efficient and effective route, the landbridge, which currently takes 13.5 hours for the 150,000 freight movements per year.  The IMDO did not feel the need to talk to the people who operate the trucks, the Irish Road Haulage Association, which had no part in this review.  Yet, the office of the Minister for Transport can release a press statement, headlined: &ldquo;Sufficient capacity on existing continental services to accommodate displaced landbridge traffic&rdquo;.  Nothing changes.  We seemingly have capacity just sitting there, waiting for Brexit to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I have been in the D&aacute;il for nine months and not one word I have said has been listened to - not one.

It is not efficient and effective.<\/p>  <p>It is the worst solution I have ever seen.  The Taoiseach, in his opening remarks in reply to Deputy McDonald, said that the Government is in the business of protecting jobs and businesses.  That report does not do that for this country.

Representatives from many political parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il, were at that meeting.  The workers were filling us in about the outcome of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, negotiations - or non-negotiations, as such.  They raised serious issues about what can be done under the legal framework of insolvency.  They said that it looks as if the ongoing impasse will mean that the current asset value of the liquidated Debenhams business might be depleted by the end of the year.  This will affect not only the workers but also the State, which would potentially forgo many millions of euro due to it as a preferential creditor.  It was also explained that the workers had been offered &euro;500,000, down from &euro;1 million.<\/p>  <p>  This dispute is now into its eighth month.  The Taoiseach talks about his sympathy for those 1,000 workers but he still does nothing.  We are eight months on.  The Debenhams workers' union, Mandate, have written to the Taoiseach twice, on 22 October and 2 November, and he has not replied on either occasion.  Words and sympathy are all well and good but what the workers want is action.  We are now 215 days into this dispute.  It is clear that the liquidators, KPMG, are not going to meet the workers' legitimate redundancy claim.  The Taoiseach could act.  He could move with urgency to establish a public State insolvency fund to deal with the situation faced by the Debenhams workers, a situation that will, most likely, be faded by other workers in the future.  It has been faced by workers in the past.  The Taoiseach could establish such a fund and make the payment to the Debenhams workers a priority.  As I have stated previously, such a fund could be financed by a small increase in employers' PRSI.  This could have been included in the recent budget.  A figure of &euro;10 million is a modest amount compared with the supports being given to businesses through loans and grants during the Covid crisis.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to act now?  This matter will only be resolved politically, it will not be resolved under the insolvency legislation.  The Taoiseach should try to resolve this dispute and protect workers into the future.<\/p>  <p>  It is now 1,715 days - in other words, four years and eight months - since the Duffy Cahill report was issued and still no action has been taken.  The Taoiseach promised yet another review but where is it?  When the Duffy Cahill report was issued, it was strongly opposed by IBEC.  Is that still the position?  Is IBEC still opposing it?  Is it because of lobbying by employers that no action has been taken on this matter?  Perhaps there is a whistleblower out there who might let us know what is really going on.<\/p>  <p>  I had another point to make but I will come back to the Taoiseach on that another time.  The Debenhams workers cannot be left out on the picket line for another week, two weeks, three weeks or four weeks.  The liquidator is saying it will potentially walk away on 23 December.  What will that mean for everybody involved?  The Debenhams workers need to be protected and we need political intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000014#O00300","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1605020700,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I discussed the matter earlier with Deputy Gino Kenny.  The situation has never been simple in terms of resolving the dispute since the liquidation occurred, as I have acknowledged and been honest about from the beginning.  People may have been given expectations during this dispute that could never be realised.  Simplistic solutions were offered which never had any prospect of being realised.  The liquidation process, in itself, was never going to replace the legitimate redundancy entitlements of the workers.<\/p> <p>The company treated the workers very shabbily.  I accept that saying that is not enough for the workers.  There has been no lobby by anybody against any resolution of this so let us not create another conspiracy.  I have had general discussions with the head of ICTU and I have met workers on this, and there has been ongoing consultations with Ministers.  The Mandate trade union has done everything it possibly can and it has not been easy for the union either.  <\/p> <p> With regard to the fund the Deputy mentioned and the increase in PRSI, that again would have far-reaching consequences as this cost would be on every employer.  Whether they are doing well or not in the middle of Covid-19, they would still be charged that.  <\/p> <p> The more important point on that is that what we are essentially proposing here, if we are to go down that route, is that one would be getting others to bail out the shoddy behaviour of some parties.  That is a general point we cannot ignore.  Once this is done once, it has been done a second and a third time, and let us be under no illusion that are creating a precedent then.  Whatever mechanism is arrived that, we all better be clear if it has far-reaching consequences and could tip the balance the wrong way.  Employers should meet their obligations and the law should be changed to ensure that collective agreements are given higher priority in liquidations.  That should certainly happen.  I will discuss this with colleagues across Government again with a view to seeing if there is any way we can develop a resolution of this and a way of bringing it to a conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000014#O00400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605021300,"counter":96,"content":"<p>A public state insolvency fund is a matter of course in European countries so it is not unusual and this proposal is not being plucked from the sky.

All sorts of reliefs have been brought in for the very wealthy in this country.  There was the special assignee relief programme where &euro;28.1 million was forgone in taxes in respect of only 1,000 top executives. The key employee engagement programme was brought in in 2017, which has cost &euro;10 million in tax incentives for top executives.  The Government is, therefore, able to bring in certain measures and to bail out the banks.  It can bring in guillotined legislation to seal the records of mother and baby homes.  When it comes to workers, creative and exceptional measures have to be put in place to deal with them.  We should also bring in longer-term practices and amendments to company law and so forth.

The census of population is a unique count of everyone present in Ireland on census night and provides essential information for planning and decision-making.  It is vital that the census enables everyone in Ireland to participate in order that the information gathered reflects all our needs and can be used to make decisions that benefit us all.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to postpone the census scheduled for 18 April 2021 until 3 April 2022 was not taken lightly and was based on a number of factors.  First and foremost for consideration was the need to ensure the safety of the general public and CSO field staff, coupled with the need to deliver a census that achieves the highest possible response rate across all facets of society.  Furthermore, the census of population is a major logistical operation and Covid-19 restrictions have prevented or delayed many key planning activities from taking place over recent months.  On consideration of these challenges, the Government decided to postpone the 2021 census until April the following year in order to enable the CSO to undertake a comprehensive, inclusive and safe census in 2022 that will provide valuable and accurate data for our country in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Between censuses, the CSO produces annual population estimates rolled forward from the previous census.  In this instance, the CSO will roll the 2016 estimates forward for an additional year until they can be recalibrated with the new detailed census data, preliminary results of which will be available in mid-2022, with definitive results coming on a phased basis from April to December 2023.  It is expected that the delay of one year will result in a similar delay in the next report of the Constituency Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Under Regulation No. 763\/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council, implementing Regulation No. 2017\/712, Ireland is required to transmit census data to EUROSTAT with a reference date in 2021.  The transmission must be made by March 2024.  The CSO will work closely with EUROSTAT to mitigate the impact of the changed census date and will consider the introduction of additional methodologies and data sources in order to satisfy EUROSTAT's requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Work on planning for census 2022 is under way.  This involves revisiting project timelines and investigating the introduction of new approaches, including online interviewing and training, to reduce further potential disruptions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000022#W01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1605024000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>We understand the public health concerns of the CSO's director general and agree that it makes sense to postpone the census.

I take it that he is saying that the CSO, for public health reasons, feels it cannot go ahead with the census.  That is perfectly understandable in the current circumstances.  However, the Government could use the interregnum to prepare for a census to take place a year later and ensure we use the information provided by it.  The census offers an enormous wealth of information that is underutilised much of the time.  It provides us with enormous detail about the changes that are happening in our society and the changing needs of our society.  If we use that information properly, we can plan for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there is often no joined-up thinking in terms of the information that is provided.  The census tells us about birth rates, for example, and it should tell us about the infrastructure we need for childcare, education and housing.  It should allow us to plan for those things, if we are using that information properly and linking it to our policy objectives and plans.  However, that does not happen.  Looking back to the 2016 census, one of the things it told us was that there were a lot more people living in households, which should have told us that we had a housing problem we needed to deal with and plan for, if we did not know that already.  It told us that we needed to plan for things like childcare provision and infrastructure, of which we are desperately short.  We have not used the information the census provides us with to plan properly for the needs of our society, particularly in areas like the provision of housing, decent school infrastructure and childcare infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000022#W01600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1605024600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I did not hear any reference to the question that I put in which is, obviously, grouped with these questions.

We have seen a large amount of pubs close which have left the isolated even further isolated around the country.  We are seeing hundreds of cr&egrave;ches, childcare services, shops, caf&eacute;s and restaurants all closing for good.  Individuals invested vast amounts of money and their own time and sweat into sustaining these businesses up until now and those businesses are being closed completely and all the jobs that exist in those businesses are being lost as well.  One of the questions that we in Aont&uacute; have been putting to the Government over the past while is that we need to be able to quantify the cost of the restrictions to know adequately whether or not the restrictions are disproportionate.  Indeed, Ireland has the sixth strictest restrictions on the planet at present even though we are third from the bottom with regards the level of Covid that exists in the country in European terms.<\/p>  <p>  Fifty-one per cent of retail has migrated online.  That is an astounding figure.  The majority of retail that exists in these twenty-six counties is currently happening online.  Many of those who have gone online will never go back to physical retail in the future.  Amazon is booming while many small Irish businesses are going bust.<\/p>  <p>  We in Aont&uacute; have put forward a Bill that looks for a 25% decrease in the wages of TDs and Senators during this period.  The sentence, \"We are all in this together\", is being thrown around like confetti and it is plainly not true.  The wages of TDs are going upwards and everybody else's wages are going downwards.<\/p>  <p>  What I am asking the Chief Whip to answer is, given that they are making serious decisions on so many people's lives, if he will quantify the number of businesses that are closed for good as a result of these restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000023#X00500","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1605024600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thought we were taking Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question separately.

The CSO is working closely with EUROSTAT to mitigate the impact of the changed census date and will consider the introduction of additional methodologies and data sources in order to satisfy all EUROSTAT's requirement.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question around engagement between the CSO and the HSE, I understand there has been extensive engagement in relation to contact tracing and around the utilisation of field officers, as the Deputy has referenced and which is a constructive suggestion.  I will ask my officials to send the Deputy a detailed note on that.  On the public health response, we need to have all pillars of the State trying to support contact tracing, particularly when there is an escalation of the epidemiological position on how we can respond to it.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I agree that we should use next year.  We should always use every occasion to look at all our data sources to inform public policy objectives and the CSO has not in any way stopped doing that.  It is continuing its work and its regular reporting to Government and its public reports and its data sources are a key objective in public policy and in responding to the changing needs of society as the Deputy referenced.  Perhaps next year there will be additional time to do that when the census is not happening.  I will bring the Deputy's feedback to the CSO in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, the CSO annual business demography figures indicate that there were 270,300 enterprises in the private business economy in 2018.  Of these, some 269,700 were small and medium-sized enterprises, 248,300 of which had less than ten persons engaged and 21,400 of which employed between ten and 249 people.<\/p>  <p>  Between April and August this year, the CSO collected and published six waves of its Business Impact of COVID-19 Survey to provide insights into the impact of the pandemic on businesses.  The result of wave six of the survey indicated that an estimated 2.5% of enterprises had ceased trading temporarily while 1.2% had ceased trading permanently at the end of August.<\/p>  <p>  The survey also asked businesses how confident they were in being able to continue trading.  It found that 3.4% of enterprises were only confident of having the resources to continue trading for another month and 1.6% were not confident of having the resources to continue trading.<\/p>  <p>  Annual statistics on business demography are compiled with a considerable time lag as they depend on processed tax-return data which enterprises may submit to the Revenue Commissioners up to 11 months after the reference year to submit.  To provide early information about the situation in 2020, the CSO is currently developing a business signs-of-life analysis which will link Covid-19 related support payments and other administrative data to the business demography statistics to identify how many businesses are continuing to trade.  The first report by the CSO on business signs of life will focus on the effect on business of employee-related supports, such as the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage support schemes.  The CSO aims to publish this report in December and to follow it up with reports on the numbers of businesses which are continuing to trade.  The CSO is also preparing to collect a larger-scale business impact of Covid-19 survey in January 2021 which will provide structural information on the impacts of the crisis on businesses throughout 2020.<\/p>  <p>  There have been significant supports in the context of budget 2021, for example, the reduced VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sector from 13.5% to 9%, the commercial rates waiver for Q4 of 2020, the 9,000 upskilling and reskilling opportunities and the extraordinary expenditure response around Covid-19 and the horizontal supports that are there in terms of the wage subsidy schemes.  That support will be ongoing to support our SMEs.  We are happy to provide further data to the Deputy from the CSO related to his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000023#X01000","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605024600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.27 p.m. and resumed at 5.39 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Confidence in T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment: Motion","time":1605025200,"counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000024#Y00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1605025200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has confidence in the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Leo Varadkar T.D. <\/blockquote> <p>The decision by Sinn F&eacute;in to table a motion of no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste was based on that party's hope that something would turn up that would help it use today for an aggressive political attack on the Government.  It was a 100% cynical move and, unfortunately, it reflects the reality of its four months as the largest Opposition party.  It has been left scrambling by the reality that nothing significant has changed since last week's two-hour session.  Let no one be in any doubt the situation relating to how the nearly-completed contract for general practitioners was given to a doctors' organisation is a legitimate point of public concern.  It occurred during the previous Government but it is a matter which this Government and D&aacute;il have a right to ask questions about.  As I have said repeatedly, it was inappropriate and it should not have happened.  When the T&aacute;naiste informed me of the issue he outlined the details of what happened and these details have remained consistent subsequently.  He also accepted without any issue that political accountability required that he come before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and answer detailed questions at length.  In substance, no one has demonstrated any personal gain from how the document was distributed and public policy was not adversely impacted.  The T&aacute;naiste has acknowledged his error and all details have been published.  Lessons have been learned all round and Ministers realise such situations should not occur during this Government.<\/p> <p> In recent days, Sinn F&eacute;in representatives were busy telling anyone who would listen that today's debate would be preceded by some blockbuster revelations that would justify the tabling of the no confidence motion.  This, of course, has not happened.  In fact, there is mounting evidence that we should be very wary of placing weight on claims made in texts between third parties.  The D&aacute;il has exercised its political oversight of this case and there has been accountability.  A number of Deputies have referred matters to regulatory and legal authorities, clearly more in hope than expectation that their legal assertions are backed up.  That is their right and the independent structures involved will carry out their work.  It is a tiresome part of debates such as this that attacks are thrown at other parties and Deputies as being somehow complicit or lacking independence.  The fact is that Ireland has a multiparty system.  Everybody who actually wants to achieve progress for the people has to be willing to work closely and constructively with others.  I profoundly reject the idea of putting partisan manoeuvring into every issue.  Sinn F&eacute;in is entitled to practise the politics of always looking for an angle and both participating in and attacking a government at the same time.  I, and my party, simply do not agree.  Quite frankly, I have no interest in playing the \"politics as usual\" to which Sinn F&eacute;in is committed.  I see no purpose in using my time in this debate to address the ever-rising examples of Sinn F&eacute;in ignoring basic ethical standards.  True republicanism is about working in the interests of all of the people and my absolute focus is showing the Irish people that their Government is working for them.<\/p> <p> At the moment our country is, with others, going through a dramatic social, economic and public health shock, which is unprecedented in the modern world.  I am happy to propose a motion of confidence in the T&aacute;naiste who is part of a coalition Government that is implementing an urgent and progressive programme to help and work with all sections of our society.  Tackling the pandemic remains ouur first priority and the House will note that this morning's report from the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC, states that Ireland now has the third lowest incidence in the EU.  We still have more progress to achieve if we are to limit the impact of the virus in the time before a vaccine is approved, manufactured and distributed but there is no doubt that the measures put in place by the Government are helping Ireland get through the pandemic's second wave.<\/p> <p> Every Minister and every part of government have been working tirelessly to respond with action to address new issues as they have emerged.  Within weeks of taking up office, we prepared and implemented a job stimulus programme to protect jobs and businesses, support our schools in reopening and respond to the urgent needs of many sectors.  The budget we introduced last month goes further and puts in place a comprehensive range of actions to support the hardest hit sectors such as hospitality and culture and is, according to every independent review, highly progressive.  People and communities whose needs are the greatest are receiving the biggest benefit of the budget.  The left and the far left in this House refuse to acknowledge it but this is a simple fact and is backed up by all independent research.  Even with the priority we must give to the pandemic, in only four months we have begun moving forward with a major programme of change and investment.  Ministers are participating in a range of Cabinet committees that are delivering an unprecedented period of policy review and development.<\/p> <p> In health, on top of resources for responding to Covid, next year will see an entirely new level of activity to deliver fast and sustained progress, including action on cancer, maternity and trauma care, a new public-only contract, 1,200 acute hospital beds, major advances in mental health services, access to diagnostics and access to new medicines.  This is not small incremental change; it is substantive progress after only a few months.  In education, the Minister and her officials have, together with the partners in education, succeeded in overcoming a series of major policy and logistical challenges and are now moving ahead to implement longer-term action, including a lower pupil-teacher ratio, a significant expansion of special education supports and a new push for inclusive schools.  These and many other actions are at the heart of our work on education.<\/p> <p> We, of course, continue to give a priority to helping to protect as many jobs as possible and secure a comprehensive and inclusive recovery.  The Government has introduced a comprehensive range of measures to support businesses of all sizes and, in particular, the small and medium-sized businesses that are bearing the biggest impact.  The T&aacute;naiste has played a central role in delivering these initiatives and continues to proactively consult many stakeholders across business to help create and retain jobs.  We have continued intensive work to secure and maintain high-valued inward investment.  As part of this, I have held a range of meetings with key employers and potential new investors.  The announcement we made last week with Pfizer of 300 new jobs confirmed that this Government is succeeding in showing that Ireland as a place to invest and to grow.  The establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was a further example of this and a signal to the inward investment community that Ireland is serious about investment in fourth level and in research.<\/p> <p> On housing, a new era of sustained support for social housing has begun.  We have also begun action on the existential threat of climate change.  Strong new legislation has been published and is going through the House and a wide series of initiatives on energy, biodiversity and sustainability are under way.  At European level, we have continued our intense engagement with our partners concerning the critical Brexit negotiations and we played a constructive role in securing agreement on the breakthrough new EU funding mechanisms.  On the future of this island, North-South interaction at ministerial level has been restored and is moving forward in a new spirit of cooperation.  The new shared Ireland initiative is under way, built on the core principle of fulfilling the vision of the Good Friday Agreement and creating a new era of cooperation, understanding and contact between communities North and South.  The &euro;500 million fund created to support the initiative marks the largest sustained investment in this area and will benefit some of our most marginalised communities.<\/p> <p> I am very pleased with the work the new Government has undertaken in only four months in office.  The three parties that formed the Government have different views on many things but we have agreed to work together in the interests of the Irish people and this is what we are doing.  At this critical moment in our country&rsquo;s history we are focused on action, not politics.  We are working with the Irish people to get through this pandemic, to build an inclusive recovery and to deliver sustained progress on critical social, economic and environmental issues and that is why I and my party will vote confidence in the T&aacute;naiste and in this Government this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000024#Y00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605025500,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I want to take this opportunity to speak to express confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.

We are here today because of a Sinn F&eacute;in attempt to continue to sow division within Government and capitalise on a mistake made by the T&aacute;naiste.  As became clear last week, Leo's motivation in bringing the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, into the fold on a new GP contract was well-meaning but it did take a shortcut.  He should not have mailed the document to the NAGP president.  He should instead have had the association briefed officially.  The T&aacute;naiste has apologised for this and said that it was wrong and not best practice.  However, if one were to read the abuse that faceless online trolls and their backers have drummed up, one would be forgiven for thinking that the T&aacute;naiste had acted for personal gain or to sabotage something instead of landing widespread support for a deal done with GPs that he cared about.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has already been before this House to explain himself thoroughly and to take questions.  It is obvious now that for some what is ongoing is not about establishing facts or truth but about sustaining a political smear campaign masquerading as whistle-blowing to inflict maximum political damage.  Let us talk about whistle-blowers.  In 2014, as Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe&rsquo;s reputation stood in tatters and as he was labelled as &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo; by his superior, who in this House stood out from the crowd and said no, the actions of Maurice McCabe were not disgusting but distinguished?<\/p> <p>The Charleton tribunal said that remark came from a brave politician, a member of Cabinet and a senior individual within the political system and it was a break for Maurice McCabe that someone of that stature was brave enough to come out and call it as it was.  That is the Leo Varadkar I know.<\/p> <p> The timeline of April 2019 shows the truth and context, for those who want to see it, on this issue.  The contracts were negotiated and done.  The detail was widely briefed to the media by the IMO, the HSE and the Government.  The Cabinet was updated.  Hundreds of GPs were at organised meetings around the country discussing the detail, with briefing documents from the IMO.  Only then did the T&aacute;naiste give the document to the NAGP in an effort to try to bring GPs together.<\/p> <p> Last week was about accountability to the House, and rightly so.  What is Sinn F&eacute;in's game here this evening?  Is it using this issue to try to sow division in a coalition during a global pandemic and as Brexit negotiations reach endgame, or is Sinn F&eacute;in's strategy simply to harvest and nurture online hate and bile regardless of the truth and cost, the politics of division and resentment?  I will let those listening to the benches opposite judge for themselves but I have no hesitation in voting confidence in Leo Varadkar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000025#Z00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605026100,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I have no hesitation in standing before the House this evening to express my full confidence in the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar.

His claim that he was acting in the interests of the taxpayer, or that the information was already in the public domain, are threadbare.  Those defences collapsed on the floor of the D&aacute;il last week.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is there is no acceptable reason for what happened.  This was not incompetence.  It was not a mistake.  This was a conscious decision by Leo Varadkar to leak inside information to his friend, and now the current Taoiseach stands idly by and Miche&aacute;l Martin's failure to act is a failure of leadership.  The Government claims that expressing no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste is disproportionate to the conduct of Leo Varadkar but here is the truth.  The truth is that if a junior civil servant or any departmental official leaked a confidential document they would be sacked, end of story.  When Leo Varadkar leaked this document he was the Taoiseach.  He was the head of government and that position comes with the highest level of responsibility, with the greatest need for ethical and honest conduct and, therefore, it comes with a greater demand for accountability.<\/p>  <p>  What angers ordinary people is that the Fine Gael leader's actions are par for the course, and part of the insider cosy club politics that has done so much damage to our country.  This is a broken politics, one that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il want people to believe has been left behind, but the politics of the cosy club really never went away.  There are favours for friends, connections to pals in the world of high finance and access to power through a simple text message, while Debenhams workers and survivors of mother and baby homes are frozen out, fighting to have their voices heard.  This is a very Fine Gael thing.<\/p>  <p>  The Government argues that Deputy Varadkar's behaviour was a technical or procedural error; \"not best practice\" they called it.  They say it bears no relevance to the bread and butter issues facing ordinary people but how very wrong they are.  The Fine Gael cosy club culture is very relevant to the bread and butter reality of people's lives because it is about access to power.  It is about what decisions are made and in whose interest, whether in the interests of ordinary people or vested interests, Ministers' friends and personal contacts.<\/p>  <p>  As we debate the motion this evening, workers and families are struggling.  Many are coping with the loss of life and the loss of livelihoods as a result of a once in a century pandemic.  They also face the uncertainty of Brexit and we are coming to the end of what has been an extraordinarily difficult year for our people.  Our people are entitled to much better from the Government than those in power playing by the rulebook of the old boys' network.<\/p> <p>The cosy club insider culture that dominates Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il is why those parties fail workers and families again and again.  It is the reason why governments come and governments go, but nothing really changes for ordinary people.<\/p> <p> I could stand here and delve into Fine Gael&rsquo;s past episodes with corruption and insider connections.  I could list the scandals, the tribunals, the abuses of power and it would take me all night, and it would get us nowhere.  This is not about the past.  This is very much about how Government is run today.  Here is what I know for sure.  As long as housing policy in this State is designed for developers and landlords, we will never fix the housing crisis.  As long as health policy is driven by profit and privatisation, we will never have a strong public health service.  As long as economic decisions are made to favour the golden circle, we will never have a fair economy that delivers for workers and families.  The truth is that for so long as this rotten insider culture is tolerated, nothing will ever change.  Houses will remain unaffordable, rents will keep going up and up and a generation will have to settle for the box room in their parents&rsquo; house as a home for themselves and their own families.  Our health system will continue to struggle with overcrowded hospitals, citizens on trolleys and children left years waiting, sometimes in agony, for treatment and for care.<\/p> <p> That is the price of government for the privileged few at the expense of the many.  It is a price that generations have paid and it has cost us dearly.  It can no longer be tolerated.  It is the politics where Fine Gael&rsquo;s Brian Hayes moves seamlessly from Government to chief lobbyist for the banks and then sits across the table from his Fine Gael friends in government when denying mortgage holders breaks for their mortgage.  It is the politics where Fine Gael&rsquo;s Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, having failed miserably to rein in the insurance industry and its crippling premiums, moves from the Department of Finance to the world of high finance.  The people we represent demand change - it is as simple as that.  They look for a future of fairness, of kindness, but above all, of equality.  They look for the possibility of better politics, where we can finally begin to realise the Ireland of the Proclamation and the vision of our better angels, a real republic that prioritises ordinary citizens and upholds the principle of good, honest government.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael clubbed together to deny that change.  People now see these parties, which desperately cling to the past, back doing what they do best: looking after the well-connected and the well-off, while ordinary people are left behind.<\/p> <p> It is lamentable that the Green Party, in which so many placed hope for change, have remained so quiet in all of this.  Their silence speaks volumes.<\/p> <p> After four months in power, this coalition has been riven with scandal.  Deputy Leo Varadkar&rsquo;s actions have undermined politics, they have undermined the Government and they have undermined the State.  Sinn F&eacute;in said the old ways would not be tolerated on our watch in opposition, and we will be held to that commitment.  We are now calling time on the politics of the cosy club.  Former Taoiseach and serving T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar, has asked for a fool&rsquo;s pardon.  Deputy Varadkar is no fool.  The people will not be fooled by the guff, bluster and bravado of bullish Government Members, whose sole concern is self-preservation.<\/p> <p> This scandalous behaviour that we have discovered, by the way, cannot be solved by Ministers simply picking their friends more carefully.  Leo Varadkar, when Taoiseach, leaked a confidential document to a friend.  He was caught and now he must be held accountable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000026#AA00300","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605026700,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000027#BB00150","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1605026700,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The Government is asking us to vote confidence in the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Government is asking us to accept his explanation for his behaviour in leaking a confidential document to a friend and head of a rival representative body, completely outside of normal procedure and appropriate practice, during a multi-million euro negotiation process.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party told the T&aacute;naiste to come clean, to tell the truth, to dispense with the incredible yarn he had been peddling and to apologise, and perhaps there may have been a way out for him.  However, the T&aacute;naiste chose not to do that.  He persisted with the line that he was leaking the document for the good of the document, a statement that takes the entire country for fools.  Then, his cheerleaders go on the public airwaves and repeat the same lines.  One Minister even suggested that the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; was printed on the document for the benefit of Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail.  The question is not only should the D&aacute;il have confidence in him, but should any trade union have confidence that they can negotiate with this Government in good faith, or should any Minister have confidence that they can share a confidential document with the T&aacute;naiste in good faith.  The fact is, in all honesty, they cannot. <\/p>  <p>  We also have no confidence in the Minister because he has shown no interest in protecting the rights of workers throughout this pandemic.  When sectoral pay agreements were struck down by the High Court, my colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, introduced emergency legislation to reinstate them, and the T&aacute;naiste dismissed this move as &ldquo;virtue signalling&rdquo;.  When the Labour Party introduced a statutory sick pay Bill, the T&aacute;naiste and his Government colleagues kicked it down the road for six months.  When ICTU walked out of the Low Pay Commission after it advocated a paltry 10 cent increase in the minimum wage, the T&aacute;naiste accepted the increase without question.  The same week, he humiliated a public official and NPHET on national television and dismissed their recommendation because they had not thought things through.  The Debenhams workers and others have been screaming for the implementation of the Duffy Cahill report, to which he is clearly indifferent.  We are quite sure the Bill we launched today on working from home and the right to switch off will be treated with similar disdain by the same Minister.  So, we have no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.  He is not a friend of the worker and now appears not to be a friend of transparent politics.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party has spent generations championing ethics in public life.  From freedom of information legislation and lobbying legislation to tackling corporate donations, Labour has worked tirelessly to clean up politics from the grubby dealings of others.  Not one Labour politician has ever faced any accusation of improper behaviour at any tribunal of inquiry.  Labour knows what it is like to have to run against Fianna F&aacute;il money, to have to run against Fine Gael money and to have to run against Sinn F&eacute;in money.  Sinn F&eacute;in now wants to present itself as the ethical left.  It says it wants to stand against insider politics and the old boys' club.  We in the Labour Party offer it some advice.  It is not good enough to describe a convicted tax cheat as a good republican because he is a member of their old boys' club.  It is not good enough to accept &pound;4 million from England to fund political activity in Ireland and then to move it around so they do not have to pay tax on it.  It is not good enough to take racist American money from bigoted Trump supporters like Congressman Pete King of New York, who was one of the architects of the Muslim ban, but who supports Sinn F&eacute;in - an insider, one of your old boys' club.  It is not good enough to have the Northern Minister for Finance send documents of the renewable heat initiative to one of its own insiders and member of the old boys' club in Belfast before it got sign-off.  Ethics in public life is important, not just when it is somebody else's old boys' club but when it is your own.<\/p>  <p>  This debate suits both Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael.<\/p> <p>They want the public to think politics in Ireland is a choice between the Varadkar conservatives and populist nationalism.  It is not.  There are enough of us in this Chamber who want to focus on the dignity of the worker and the eradication of homelessness, poverty and Covid-19 and who value the liberation of education and the well-being of all our people.  We will continue to work with others to bring honour and ethics to Irish politics.  Despite often harsh words between us, we have confidence in many individuals and groupings in this Oireachtas.  That confidence does not extend to the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000027#BB00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605027300,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I am glad to address the House on this serious issue.

The Green Party stated that it was important that these issues were addressed in the House, as they were in detail last week.  We welcome the opportunity for that to occur again today.  We stand for parliamentary accountability in our democracy.<\/p><p>We also welcomed, having listened to the T&aacute;naiste set out his version of events, his admission that what had happened was not right and his apology for such an error of judgment.  We accepted that apology.  The disclosure of information in this case was not right and he acknowledged that.  There is a reason we have the Cabinet rule book and codes for how we must do everything through official channels to protect the public interest and, in the end, to protect the political system from accusations of partisanship or patronage.  It is important that we follow those rules, treat documents with the highest confidence and make that work.<\/p><p>I have confidence that this Government can and will engage in that other method, partnership.  We need to work collectively and with every section of society and a variety of interests in order that we deliver the Government's goals of tackling the health and housing crises and preparing this country to face the climate challenge ahead of us.  That partnership has to work.  We referred to that partnership in our statement last week.  It was not silence, as Deputy McDonald stated.  It was us listening and trying to give our assessment in our response, which we did, that we need to learn lessons from such occasions, as the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged.  He wished, as he said, he had done it differently at that time.  We in Government commit to doing things differently and in partnership with the people of this country, the various institutions and vested interests, not just for their vested interests but for the public interest.  We do that by being open in how we share data but also by making sure we treat data in confidence and with competence and that those we work with do the same in every section of society.  That is our responsibility.  We are in a coalition; it is not a club.<\/p><p>Confidence in the Government and the T&aacute;naiste extends to the confidence and ability to ask questions and say, as we have said, &quot;That is not right&quot;.

I have served in government with the T&aacute;naiste since 2014 and knew him for many years before that.  The personal and political qualities I have known in him in that time have been apparent again in recent weeks - his openness, honesty and accountability; his genuine commitment to advancing the public interest; and his willingness to acknowledge a mistake.  Leo Varadkar's politics are those of decency, progress and doing the right thing by our country.  His track record is clear in the leadership he demonstrated in delivering the best outcomes for our country in the many challenges of Brexit; his empathy and decisiveness in leading our country through a demanding and dark phase of Covid-19; and his unstinting support for the management of the economy, public pay and public finances, which has enabled us to meet this moment of challenge from a position of strength.<\/p><p>Contrast those qualities and that record with the record of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party.  Its attack today is the same as it ever was and ever will be.  It is a single transferable critique of our political system, a claim that others act in the interests of elites and insiders.  Sinn F&eacute;in would have us believe it occupies the high moral ground and is interested only in the public good.  I suspect its Members know this is rhetoric.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin recently described this as the political tactic of left populism.  Position oneself as the real representative of the real people and condemn the rest of the political system as acting in the interests of others.  We can see the dark places that this kind of politics can lead to.  It is not, I believe, the politics of the majority of this House or the majority of our country.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in does not appeal to the better angels of our nature.  Instead, it seeks to arouse the darker spirits to make its case.  It is a deeply cynical politics that Sinn F&eacute;in has practised for too long.  It is for EU membership but against every treaty that has brought our country closer to Europe.  It is for jobs and business but against every economic decision pursued by this State in our modern era.  That is the politics of division.  It is the defining feature of Sinn F&eacute;in's politics and it is encapsulated in the motion today.<\/p><p>While Sinn F&eacute;in positions itself as the only party on the side of ordinary people, it is more in bed with big money than any party in this D&aacute;il.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the richest party on the island of Ireland, as its finance director confirmed earlier this year, with many staff and an extensive property network across the island.  This network comprises 50 properties, which does not compare with any other party.  Equally, no other party funds itself like Sinn F&eacute;in.  Was the banning of corporate donations by a previous Fine Gael-led Government, which has been maintained by recent Governments, the act of a political party that wants to protect an inner circle and keep an old boys' club going?  That type of behaviour better matches the description of Sinn F&eacute;in.  As its finance director told <i>The Irish Times<\/i>earlier in the year: <\/p> <blockquote> \tWay back, we brought the bulk of it [which is money] into here [which is the Republic].  It helped us build ... the party a lot.  It was a lot of money. <\/blockquote>  <p>Sinn F&eacute;in always wants to point the finger rather than point the way.  It speaks - and Deputy McDonald spoke - of undermining the State.  There is no party less qualified to warn this Government of undermining the State than Sinn F&eacute;in.  It looks to provide heat, not light.It looks to provide sound and fury, signifying and advancing nothing but its own political interests.  This is in contrast with the T&aacute;naiste, which is why I have full confidence in him.  He serves and looks to serve our country with distinction.  He acts in the public good and looks to advance the public interest.  That is his track record and that is why he deserves the support of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000028#CC00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1605027900,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Today's debate is about low standards, credibility and trust but, most of all, it is about how Government business is done by Fine Gael.  Last week, Leo Varadkar admitted to leaking a highly confidential document.  When his colleague, the then Minister for Health, was asked to leak the same document, he refused, yet the leader of Fine Gael passed the document, marked \"Confidential\" and \"not for circulation\", to a personal friend and political supporter.  He gave it to an individual and organisation that stood to gain, organisationally and financially, from securing that privileged information.<\/p>  <p>  Leo Varadkar's claim that he did this in the public interest is simply not credible.  The Government was not talking to the NAGP, and that organisation had a history of seeking to undermine previous GP contracts.  The simple fact is that the leader of Fine Gael broke the rules.  He breached the confidentiality of Cabinet and sensitive Government contract negotiations, all to give a dig out to a friend.  If anyone did this in any other job, they would be sacked.  Just because he was the head of Government does not mean that lower standards should be applied.  Of course, we know, however, that this is how Fine Gael does business.  It looks after those on the inside while leaving the vast majority behind.<\/p>  <p>  How many former Fine Gael Deputies and Ministers are now corporate lobbyists?  Enda Kenny works for VentureWave Capital, Brian Hayes for the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland and Michael D'Arcy for the Irish Association of Investment Managers.  I could name many more.  Indeed, it seems that Fine Gael is fertile recruiting ground for lobbyists who trade in access and influence.  All of this has a price.  Ordinary people pay the consequence for such insider trading.  That is why the private sector has a privileged position in housing policy, why the Government gives more money to big developers and institutional landlords than local authorities and approved housing bodies, why investment funds pay virtually no tax but charge sky-high rents, why banks are bailed out but struggling mortgage holders are left to fend for themselves and why, thanks to the current Minister for Housing and his predecessor, we have the worst social and affordable housing crisis in recent history.<\/p>  <p>  Today, Deputies have a clear choice.  They can vote confidence in Leo Varadkar and send out a clear signal that all of this is okay and that Fine Gael is still in charge and calling the shots.  Alternatively, Deputies can say that enough is enough and that it is time to end low standards in high places, time to end insider dealing and time for a Government that looks out for everyone and not just its friends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000029#DD00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1605027900,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The situation we are dealing with here should never really have arisen.  The T&aacute;naiste, while Taoiseach, last year engaged in an action which was wrong.  He was found out and had to own up.  He should have admitted that it was wrong and apologised.  That would probably have been the end of it.  However, he never admitted it was wrong and instead concocted a false narrative, a cock and bull story which clearly misrepresented the truth on a number of counts.  Arguably, that was the greater error because the truth matters.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste first tried to make out that the confidential document which he leaked was somehow not confidential, despite it being clearly marked \"Confidential, not for circulation\".  This was a negotiation document that was still in process with the IMO.  The document was not capable of being finalised at that point as there were a number of outstanding issues to be agreed between the parties to it.  There was not sign-off by the IMO until 16 April and it took another month before the final document was published by the Department.  The then Minister for Health clarified last week that this was actually the case.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste tried to make out that what he did was some kind of noble action, that he had a legitimate objective and that he was honouring the Government commitment.  There was no basis whatsoever for this claim.  Anyone who knew anything about medical politics at the time knew that the row between the NAGP and the IMO was vicious.  The T&aacute;naiste had been a member of the IMO and, anyway, he had lots of friends who were GPs from both organisations, as he has told us.  We know the intention of the NAGP's inner sanctum was to scupper the IMO's win on the contract negotiations and to upstage the IMO on the eve of its annual general meeting by releasing details of the arrangement.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should check his dates on this because what he said earlier was simply not correct.<\/p>  <p>  If there was any truth in what the T&aacute;naiste claimed, surely he would have urged Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail and the NAGP to support and promote the agreement.  There is no evidence that he did this.  In addition, if there was any hint of truth in this, he would, of course, have co-operated with the line Minister to that end but, no, he went behind the back of the then Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  On 26 January 2017, the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, was contacted by a former member of the Air Corps on the issue of premature deaths, which is serious and needs urgent examination.  There had been 86 premature deaths recorded since the 1980s, including 32 personnel under the age of 50, with many in their 20s, 30s and 40s.  Twenty members have died since that contact was made in 2017.  The T&aacute;naiste's response at the time was to refer to the Cabinet handbook.  He stated that the handbook, \"doesn't allow me to go behind the backs of other ministers or enter into confidence with someone else to exclude them.\"  He also indicated that he had signed a contract to observe collective responsibility .  It is not that the T&aacute;naiste did not know the rules, it was that he decided not to abide by them in respect of the IMO document.<\/p>  <p>  Not only was the T&aacute;naiste aware that he should not have interfered with the work of the Minister for Health but he also knew that, according to the Cabinet handbook, he was bound by the officeholders' code of conduct which states that officeholders should respect confidences entrusted to them in the course of their official duties.  The T&aacute;naiste clearly breached this requirement.  His Trumpian defence that he, as Taoiseach at the time, was the arbiter of what he was allowed to do is laughable.<\/p>  <p>  What added insult to injury for the public was that, as leader of Fine Gael, the T&aacute;naiste required his Cabinet colleagues to demean themselves by parroting cynically crafted spin lines and repeating his false narrative across the airwaves.  His actions in respect of this sordid affair were unworthy of his office.  He damaged the Government and he damaged trust in politics.  For that reason, and for all of the reasons and facts I have set out, the Social Democrats cannot vote confidence in him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000029#DD00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1605027900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>This motion raises two important issues from my point of view.  The first of these is the issue of confidentiality and accountability on the part of Government.  This brings me to what I want to see more of in Irish public life, namely, more openness and transparency at government level.  The public want and are entitled to more openness, accountability and transparency on the part of the Government.  We inherited a Victorian approach to politics.  I want to see a change that includes more open discussion of and debate on how the Government spends public money in advance of decisions we make.  We hide behind commercial sensitivity and confidentiality clauses in contracts.  As a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I have seen many cases where those who spend public money have not been held publicly accountable.<\/p> <p>I can give examples of many of the public private partnerships where contracts can run for up to 25 years.  Confidentiality clauses in these contracts are preventing openness in discussion and transparency in accounting.  In most cases, these conditions are not justified from the taxpayer's point of view.  The same can be said of the national broadband plan.<\/p> <p> We are all familiar with our annual budget day announcements when the only surprise is when there is something in the Minister&rsquo;s statement that was not published in the morning newspapers.

The culture of confidentiality in public life is excessive in Ireland.<\/p> <p> The second issue I see in this debate is political gamesmanship.  We are the middle of a Covid-19 pandemic in which almost 2000 people have died.  Many people are suffering, with hundreds of thousands of people on the pandemic unemployment payment and wage subsidy schemes.  Businesses are struggling but the people of Ireland are strong.  If the Opposition was sincere about accountability, we would have a debate on that issue.  Instead, it chose the nuclear option of bringing down a Minister and, by extension, this Government, which would result in a general election in the middle of this unprecedented Covid-19 crisis.

They have decided to measure political effectiveness, not in terms of legislation passed, bipartisan work under way or policy proposals to tackle major societal issues, but rather in decibel levels, units of anger and soundbites of division.  A good day at the office for Sinn F&eacute;in is one on which it has sown the seeds of mistrust and misinformation about a political opponent and amplified it online, often with the help of faceless trolls.  For that party to succeed, it believes others must fail.  This week we saw Sinn F&eacute;in engage in the grubby politics of \"let them deny it\".  I have worked with many good, decent and sincere people from across the political spectrum in this House.  This is a stunt.  It is simply another attempt to divide.<\/p>  <p>  Leo Varadkar is a committed, energetic, smart and sincere leader.  I have seen his judgment at first hand during the Covid-19 pandemic and his leadership in trying to keep us all safe as we grappled with a deadly virus.  We would not have a new general practice agreement were it not for his leadership.  He set it is an absolute priority on becoming Taoiseach.  He brought Departments together around the table, banged heads, set objectives, timelines and funding streams and he got it done.<\/p>  <p>  When the T&aacute;naiste made a mistake, he apologised.  Have others in this House ever made a mistake?  Perhaps they attended a public gathering in Northern Ireland in breach of public health guidelines.  Maybe they staged what was effectively a political rally in a graveyard in the midst of severe restrictions when people could not go to the funerals of close relatives, despite the fact that the deceased was not even being buried in the cemetery in question.  Perhaps someone was invited to a key briefing on Covid-19 with our top medical experts but was too busy, left early and then claimed not to have been fully briefed on the pandemic.  Perhaps they came into this House and used parliamentary privilege to erroneously accuse people of financial wrongdoing and then, on being proven wrong, sadly forgot to apologise.  Perhaps they jumped up and down in outrage in this Chamber and smeared the then Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, and when she was completely exonerated by Mr. Justice Charleton, they also forgot to apologise.  Everybody makes mistakes and I am sure none of us wishes to be defined by them.<\/p>  <p>  The smears and innuendo that are creeping into political life need to stop.  There was an undertone in the last week.  We and the Opposition all know it.  Not one Member of this House called it out.  It is wrong and it cannot go unchecked.  It is time to focus on the issues.  In the week that the people of the United States, thank God, rejected the politics of Trumpism, do not dare try to introduce it in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000030#EE00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1605028500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000030#EE00400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1605028500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle.  In the course of a conversation with a constituent last week, I learned that it was 100 years ago, last Wednesday, since the Black and Tans had burned her grandfather&rsquo;s creamery.  He had to go on the run, leaving his family, with the price of &pound;1,000 on his head.  Afterwards, I received a message from her saying that her grandparents were committed to a republic, a better world, equality of access to education and employment and their democratic right to vote.  She mentioned equality of access.  For these just rights, she said, they risked their livelihoods and their lives.  Are we, as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, staying true to this legacy?  Spin will not paper over these cracks.  Are we now going to deliver a vote of confidence in this T&aacute;naiste in the light of the leaking of confidential information which has been well discussed?  We know the T&aacute;naiste believes that every Member of this House routinely leaks information and that a culture of spin and calculated leaks is completely acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We remember the promise of the so-called democratic revolution of former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, but our lot was a bank bailout and the continued prosperity of the well-heeled, the golden circle.  Who benefits from this type of cronyism?  It is banks, the insurance industry and Fine Gael&rsquo;s friends.  What fate is in store for those who are not well-connected?  Weeks ago, we had the survivors of mother and baby homes being ignored and dismissed by this very Government, whereas those who know the T&aacute;naiste personally get confidential documents posted to them without question.  It shows the insidious nature of insider politics.  This, as the phrase in Kerry goes, leads to &ldquo;daoine at&aacute; f&aacute;gtha in &aacute;it na leathphingine&rdquo;, those who are neglected or left behind.  That seems to be the fate of rural Ireland with this T&aacute;naiste and his party.  Can people in rural Ireland enter the golden circle, the prism of privilege, the fortress of the favoured?  School secretaries, who have no pension or job security and are on a two-tier pay scale, certainly cannot enter.  I know one school secretary who worked for 28 years under these conditions.  These secretaries were promised help but were then told that to help would be to open the floodgates.  The Debenhams workers I saw in Tralee at the weekend certainly cannot enter.  They are maintaining their vigil through the November nights with their hopes of assistance from Fine Gael or its partners in Government fading fast.  The small inshore fishermen of the south west certainly cannot enter as they see the bays of Kerry literally being cleaned out by the larger boats following the recent High Court case.<\/p> <p>Unlike the vulture funds, there will be no rushed legislation for those who choose to maintain a family fishing tradition; certainly not for seasonal workers, tour guides, bar staff and those in music and the arts excluded from the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP; and, finally, certainly not for those who live off the main roads of rural Ireland who cannot access broadband after the populous areas were carved up by the large companies and the State was again left to pick up the tab.  One school in Kerry that contacted the Department of Education and Skills to complain about substandard broadband was told to contact their local representatives.<\/p> <p> Today is the 100th anniversary of the end of the Siege of Tralee when, among other events, county hall, the seat of local democracy, was burned down by occupying Black and Tans.  The Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il-controlled county council does not want to talk about that event or commemorate it in any way.  Maybe they are afraid that the motives of those who struggled for equality 100 years ago and remembering men like Frank Hoffman, John Cantillon and Michael Maguire would lay bare the contrast between the promise of then and the reality of now.

We are debating their motion and the outcome of it is clear.  After tonight, normal people will look back and say, \"He got away with it again\".  I refer to normal people like a young care worker in a small local hospital who was suspended for seven weeks for daring to put a post on Facebook criticising a management decision to spend multiples of her annual wage, which was less than &euro;30,000 a year at the time, on a piece of art when there was a trolley crisis in her hospital.  She did not break a confidentiality.  She expressed a widely held view of wasted resources during a health crisis.  I refer to normal people like 500 paramedics who joined a breakaway union called NASRA.  It was a breakaway, rival union about which the T&aacute;naiste, when he was then Taoiseach, said repeatedly to us in the previous D&aacute;il that the Government could not and would not deal with because it was outside the ICTU camp.

They are doing it out of self-preservation.  Deputy Eamon Ryan's statement stooped very low when he used the climate crisis as a reason for backing this confidence motion in Leo Varadkar.

We will spend valuable D&aacute;il time today making speeches about a document the detail of which was in the public domain when the then Taoiseach passed it on.

He took his mandate as Taoiseach very seriously and at all times was conscious of the enormous responsibility placed on his very young shoulders.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste does not wear his heart on his sleeve but that does not diminish his passion to serve all the people or his ambition to get things done.  The politics presented to us tonight is of the rawest and most fundamental form &mdash; the politics and power.  The real priority political issues of the day are sidelined.

It is all about Sinn F&eacute;in's focus on political game playing.  In June 2020, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in proclaimed, &ldquo;[B]e very sure you will see in action the most coherent and effective opposition in the history of the State.&rdquo;  People would have been forgiven for believing Sinn F&eacute;in was moving away from the populist politics of the past, such as its trying to convince the public it was entitled to be in government after a general election even though it got less than one quarter of the overall vote.  So convinced was Sinn F&eacute;in of its entitlement that it organised a series of public meetings all around the country to demand that it get into power.  It displayed the same understanding of the electoral system as Donald Trump has done in recent days but, in fairness, at least he nearly did get half the vote in his election.<\/p>  <p>  That Sinn F&eacute;in can stand here with a straight face today is interesting in the context of its recent decision to accept from the estate of Mr. William Hampton a donation of more than &pound;4 million sterling, a far cry from the maximum allowable donation under Irish electoral law, which is &euro;2,500.  Today is obviously an attempt by Sinn F&eacute;in to change the narrative.  Will Sinn F&eacute;in, given its recent windfall, be offering to reimburse the taxpayer for the &euro;25,000 it has cost to bring us here for a vote today?  Would any Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy be willing to stand up for more than an hour and answer questions, as Leo Varadkar did, on that donation, on the circumstances surrounding the resignation of Sinn F&eacute;in members over the acceptance of Covid-related state grants, or on why it was only when the media got wind of the story that grants had been paid into Sinn F&eacute;in accounts that any action was taken?  I presume Sinn F&eacute;in's same standard of accountability is not required in this instance.  Instead of offering effective, constructive opposition, it offers populism once again.<\/p>  <p>  At a time of a Covid pandemic, a Brexit crunch point fast approaching and several key challenges facing our country, Sinn F&eacute;in is more concerned with political one-upmanship and point-scoring.  That is not the politics I am interested in.  It is not a form of politics that serves our country well.

Deputy Varadkar, as Taoiseach in 2019, gave a confidential draft document, a contract worth &euro;210 million that was still under discussion with the IMO, to his friend, the president of a rival organisation, on his request.  It was done not through official channels but through private text messages before deleting all traces of the correspondence.  A friend of the Taoiseach requested a confidential Government document by text message and Leo delivered.  End of.  If a civil servant did the same, it would constitute gross misconduct, trigger disciplinary action and be grounds for dismissal.  What are the consequences for the T&aacute;naiste?  Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and Fine Gael believe there should be no consequences, or no sanction.  We disagree.  The T&aacute;naiste has crossed the line and we are expected to just look away.  This is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Truth be told, this is how Fine Gael does its business.  It involves the politics of the insider, the favour for friends, and access to power for those in high places, but the politics of the insider comes at a price for those on the outside.  In this regard, just consider insurance.  People are still being ripped off owing to extortionate premium costs.  Why?  It is because the insurance industry sat down with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and asked him to ensure key sections of my legislation, passed by these Houses, would be blocked.  The Minister did as he was asked.  Tens of thousands of mortgage holders have seen their mortgages on their homes sold to vulture funds.  The vultures asked Fine Gael to block legislation that I introduced that would not allow for the sale of those mortgages without consent.  Fine Gael did as it was asked because that is how power works for it.  One day it is tasked with holding vested interests to account and the next it becomes the chief lobbyist on the other side.  In this regard, just look at the record.  A former Fine Gael Minister of State, Mr. Michael D'Arcy, spent three years in the Department of Finance, or three years being lobbied by the fund industry, yet, three months after leaving office, he became the chief lobbyist.  The banks are another example.  Another former Fine Gael Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, spent three years in the Department of Finance and he is now the chief lobbyist for the banking and vulture fund industry.  The revolving door keeps spinning.  It is a consistent pattern; it is the politics of Leo Varadkar.  Those on the inside will always have his ear.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste's excuse for leaking the confidential documents simply does not hold up.  He claims it was some part of a mastermind strategy to get the contract over the line, but strategy requires initiative.  This was at his initiative.  It was his friend who requested the document from the Minister for Health.  That Minister refused to give it to him because it was confidential but Leo delivered for his friend.  When he was asked to get it, he obliged.  He did so in secret and without telling anyone, covering his tracks and deleting the correspondence.  He claims leaking the document was part of a strategy to engage with the NAGP but we know there was no engagement with the NAGP on the part of the Government or the Department of Health.  Indeed, the only engagement was when Deputy Varadkar stuck a confidential document in the post to give to his friend, the head of the organisation that was rival to the IMO.  The T&aacute;naiste says the agreement was in the public domain but it was not.  Every single one of the 130 pages had stamped across it, &ldquo;Confidential.  Not for circulation.&rdquo;  We are aware there were at least 35 further changes.  <\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has been caught red-handed.  He leaked confidential, commercially sensitive Government information to a friend.  He and his Government colleagues believe he is above accountability but he is not, nor should he be.  The question in this House is whether we are going to stand for this.  Are we going to allow for this kind of cosy insiders' club to continue, or are we going to vote for accountability?

How will we be able to turn around to anyone else at any level of government or in the Civil Service if he or she does exactly the same thing in the future?

That the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was not aware of that sharing of information was also wrong.  It displayed a lack of trust in the then Minister.  The bottom line is that the then Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, displayed a complete lack of judgment and undermined his colleagues in government and in his party.  If such a situation involving one of his colleagues in government were to arise, I doubt that the T&aacute;naiste would take the same approach.  The record speaks for itself in this regard, with the T&aacute;naiste having thrown colleagues under the bus in the past in similar situations.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that Leo Varadkar has done wrong.  He needs to face the consequences of his actions.  In my opinion, his party needs to reprimand him.  It is Fine Gael's responsibility to deal with this matter.  The current Government, led by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was not a party to the current T&aacute;naiste's action and should not be drawn into this mess.  Fine Gael needs to stand up and demonstrate transparency in its action to deal with this issue.  It should be dealt with internally by Fine Gael.<\/p>  <p>  We are in the convention centre at an additional cost of more than &euro;25,000 of taxpayers' money to have this debate.

In fact, what he did was wrong and he should face the consequences for doing it, but action should be taken by his party, Fine Gael.  The Government has far more important issues to deal with than this.  Covid-19 and Brexit need our full attention and we need a strong Government to deal with them.  In my opinion, the Government, led by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is a strong one and needs to be given the opportunity to govern.  What we do not need is for matters like this to arise and deflect from the real issues of the day.<\/p>  <p>  I will support the motion of confidence in the T&aacute;naiste for the reasons I have outlined, but I expect his party to take some form of disciplinary action so that this kind of behaviour does not happen again.

That is deep cynicism; it is not the beautiful game of football that engenders the commitment and courage that we all admire.  We face a similar situation here.  This motion is motivated by cynicism and is a return to the worst form of tribal politics where we seek to portray our opponents in the blackest colours we can dream up.  One after another, people have come into the Chamber with their theatrical descriptions of insiders and hollow terms like \"capitalists\" and \"Black and Tans\".  These are the sorts of image that people are trying to conjure in a debate like this one.<\/p>  <p>  We are seeing tribal politics across the globe.  We need to pull up so that we can understand where this will bring us.  We all look with disdain at the fake news and vicious characterisation of opponents in other countries and at the pandering to prejudice that has divided many communities.  Ireland is fortunate that we have not had those divisions.  We need to find a politics that is more honest with the people and faces up squarely to the sorts of challenge that people are trying to contend with in their daily lives.  That is the work of a parliament.  Sadly, we seem to think that politics should be about this theatrical approach.  We are sent here to try to resolve differences and conflicts, not to create division.<\/p> <p>Leo Varadkar is a politician who has done that throughout his career.  He sought to progress change in a community where he understood that change is disruptive and can hurt people.  He has sought to bring people with us.<\/p> <p> People are looking to politics now for competence and compassion.  That is what Leo Varadkar has shown, especially during this difficult Covid-19 crisis, but his political opponents want to drag him down.  That is where this motion has come from.  It is trying to prolong the sense of division and damage.  It is directly out of the stable of fake news and the echo chamber of social media that they seek to drive those messages through.<\/p> <p> Politics can be and will be better than that.

It is preposterous that this Parliament is spending its time today on this political stunt by Sinn F&eacute;in instead of on the major issues of the day.  The T&aacute;naiste made himself immediately available to this House.  He answered every question put to him and was happy to do so, as was appropriate.  Having spent time on that, causing this House to repeat the debate in this way is only play-acting.  It is not serious or genuine.  If it was, Sinn F&eacute;in would have put this motion down immediately.  As the Taoiseach said, it is only an opportunity to get another run of publicity for the weekend.<\/p>  <p>  People in here are not surprised by that, no matter the jeers and sneers pushed out for everyone around.  We all see the failure to respect basic facts and the complete devotion to populist politics, which have been so destructive throughout the world.  We have all seen the utter lack of restraint on a serious issue as recently as today.  Those in Sinn F&eacute;in are not serious liberal democratic parliamentarians.  They do not make up the responsible Opposition unlike others who have been before them and others who are here today.  Those in Sinn F&eacute;in are in politics for the imagery, not the tough decision-making of senior political office and the years and yards of detail that go before it.  The image-focused superficial approach to policy is exposed week after week.  The Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson promises and extra 100 intensive care unit beds but when asked cannot tell where they should go.  He says only that he will write to the HSE to tell those responsible to hurry on.  The justice spokesperson used the charge last week to try to break the link between the Government pandemic plan and the Garda capacity to enforce it for its duration.  The Sinn F&eacute;in party leader, after crying foul that she was not included in information on the pandemic, could not find her way to stay for the duration of a briefing provided by senior medical officials.  All of this is because Sinn F&eacute;in is not concerned by detail but only by theatre.  We all saw this Sinn F&eacute;in theatre in Milltown Cemetery after the funeral of Bobby Storey, which was taking place some 12 km away on the other side of town.  It was not so much a funeral at that point as an opportunity for pageantry and for the big men in this House to stand up front with the big men who went before them.<\/p>  <p>  We all saw the lack of concern for detail when it emerged that three Sinn F&eacute;in representatives had &euro;10,000 resting in their accounts from the Covid support payments for over six months.  They were instantly sacked when the BBC uncovered it, but what happened before that?  In all seriousness, how did they not notice it?  Is there so much money in Sinn F&eacute;in accounts that &euro;10,000 here or there did not register for three separate people?  Was it only three?  Did others get it?  It is shady.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have plenty to say about everyone else.  They are more than happy to create links and conspiracies that do not exist but when confronted in their own party about serious criminal acts, there is no one with anything to say on anything.  Think back to all those people who saw nothing in or near a packed pub in Belfast the night Robert McCartney was brutally murdered.  Think about all the smears and lies to discredit M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill, who had the temerity and extraordinary bravery to speak out against one of Sinn F&eacute;in's elites, one of the party's untouchables.  It was claimed she was mentally unstable and implied that she was promiscuous.  Hate, bile and untruths were spread, all because she stood up and gave an account of her abusive experience and Sinn F&eacute;in's failure to respond to it.  Sinn F&eacute;in is a party rife with the culture of cover-up but what it is covering up has had much graver consequences for the lives of people on this island.<\/p>  <p>  Let us switch out the names and imagine Leo Varadkar or any other party leader in this House being happy to stand over what Sinn F&eacute;in does.  It is inconceivable.  Do Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies actually believe that Leo Varadkar should resign for this matter?  It warrants questions in the D&aacute;il and he has been accountable.  If so, then why would Michelle O'Neill not resign or, for that matter, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, Deputy Pearse Doherty and the others who travelled, attended and made no semblance of abiding by the rules?  They did so to such an extent that there has been a police investigation into it ever since.  Those in Sinn F&eacute;in are the masters of throwing stones and rockets around them but they never turn the light on themselves - we know that.  The silent, polite, non-abusive, good people of Ireland who remain horrified by the actions of those in Sinn F&eacute;in know it too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000034#JJ00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1605030900,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I will begin my brief contribution by saying I have no intention of personalising this issue.

It is worth recalling that this fiasco is merely the latest instance in a series of events that have brought the operation of the D&aacute;il and our national Parliament into disrepute.  Last year, we had \"swing-gate\" and \"vote-gate\".  This year, it is leak-gate and the year is not over.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste displayed willingness to come before the House last week.  However, such actions on his part cannot and should not act as some kind of parliamentary absolution.  The T&aacute;naiste was the senior political officeholder in the land when he deliberately leaked the draft contract.  He is thereby held to a higher standard, yet in the past week we have seen no meaningful action in terms of parliamentary or party political sanction.  The Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues have backed him to the hilt but not one of them has been able to identify what sanction he should rightly face.  A two-hour session facing questions in the D&aacute;il cannot be the limit of his responsibility or accountability in this serious matter.  If there was even the slightest hint of a sanction being applied before this debate, I would have a different view.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the lack of consistency with regard to sanctions.  We have seen several Oireachtas Members already sanctioned this year and the year has not yet ended.  The general public are asking politicians like me why there is no consistency in sanctions and a lack of consistency in this case.  The lack of sanction in this case forced the hand of the Opposition.  In that respect, the fault lies with the T&aacute;naiste and the Government alone.  On account of this fact and this stark reality, I will be voting no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000034#JJ00300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1605030900,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I am to happy stand here this evening but I and the people at home are aghast.

The IMO had issued a five-page summary document which outlined the important financial and other components several days before the T&aacute;naiste passed it on to Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail.  Nonetheless, this was wrong.  The document should at the very least have been passed on through formal channels.  The T&aacute;naiste came before the D&aacute;il last week, accepted his errors of judgment and apologised.  He made a serious mistake but has apologised publicly more than once.  In my opinion, intent matters as much as, if not more than, process.  While the process was wrong, I accept the T&aacute;naiste's explanation that his intent was good in that it was to secure universal acceptance of a GP contract across the GP community.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, an article was published purporting to show that the T&aacute;naiste had deliberately attempted to mislead the D&aacute;il as to the extent of his friendship with Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail.

Running through the messages is a pervasive sense of entitlement: \"We are the boys who run the show, or who should run the show.\"  Underpinning these flights of fancy was the claim of easy access to the T&aacute;naiste and senior Ministers.  However, Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail has in media reports accepted the T&aacute;naiste's version of events, namely, that they had three meetings, so I see no evidence of a smoking gun.<\/p>  <p>  I have not deviated from the subject in hand to make political points.

The predictable row at 2 p.m. over the Order of Business and the move to the convention centre should also have been avoided.  As I said in the D&aacute;il Chamber, there was no reason the Government could not have put forward its motion to be taken tomorrow, when we are due to sit here.  That would have allowed us to avoid the cost of moving here today.<\/p>  <p>  I read the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's circular entitled \"Policy on the Use of Private Email and Other Private Messaging Services\", which was sent around by HR in April 2019.  The circular related to the use of services other than official Oireachtas-designated modes of communication.  It states that it relates to civil servants, but surely the point here is that a T&aacute;naiste and Minister's ability to carry out his official Government work to the highest standard must also mean that he is at the very least held to the same standards as Government and departmental officials.  The circular even allows for exemptions to the rule but states that information relating to Government business must be forwarded to official work accounts prior to being deleted.  Point 12 states: \"Failure to adhere to the requirements set out in this Circular may result in disciplinary action under the Civil Service Disciplinary Code.\"  Why do Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party think that the T&aacute;naiste is above the standards we set for our civil servants?  We are public servants and we should be held accountable for our actions.  It appears to me that the T&aacute;naiste actively deleted his account rather than forward the messages to the official account.  As far as I can see, from looking at WhatsApp, one has to actively delete an account on that messaging service.  It cannot be done by accident and does not happen automatically either.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste could simply apologise and step down, as a previous T&aacute;naiste, Frances Fitzgerald, did.  There is no excuse for Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Deputies to say they have confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.  He undermined best practice in the context of standards in public office - this much he has admitted - and should now face the consequences of his actions.  If the T&aacute;naiste thinks that \"Welfare cheats cheat us all\", what does he think about politicians who behave as if they are above the standards set for us and for those in the Civil Service?

My colleagues have outlined many instances of hypocrisy but I will focus on one.  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have talked about the challenging year people have faced due to Covid-19.  In the midst of this pandemic, however, we saw Sinn F&eacute;in pack the streets and a cemetery for a funeral that was not even a funeral but was, in fact, a political rally organised by Sinn F&eacute;in in west Belfast.  When asked to account for its actions in its undermining of public health, we faced silence.  Sinn F&eacute;in has needlessly subjected the D&aacute;il to this circus a week after the T&aacute;naiste answered every question put to him and made himself accountable to this House, unlike those on the Opposition benches.<\/p>  <p>  I have worked with the T&aacute;naiste for eight years.  I have seen how he works with other people and with organisations, political parties and colleagues.  I have seen how he has worked in difficult situations with challenging problems as he tries to ensure that he listens to every single position put forward and that the best outcome is reached for everybody concerned.  One does not have to work with him closely to see this; one need only look at the work he has done on Brexit.  He is an honourable person.  He cares about his work.  People say he is ambitious.  To be an ambitious public representative is to ensure the best possible outcome in everything one does for the people whom one represents.<\/p>  <p>  As Taoiseach, one of Deputy Varadkar's priorities - and he made no secret of this - was to ensure that a deal was reached for a new GP contract.  He is a former Minister for Health and someone who has trained as a GP and who saw the benefits of the contract, not just for patients but also for GPs and the wider public.  This was his sole motive in sharing this document with the NAGP.  He has apologised for how this was done but has also answered every question put to him in the House.  That is why this motion is cynical, uncalled for and a waste of precious time when we could be dealing with issues such as Covid-19, Brexit or the multiple items of legislation and issues that people have elected us to deal with.

I am sorry for my actions that gave rise to tonight's motion and I accept sole responsibility for them.  While my motivations were sound, the manner in which I conducted myself was not.  I do regret this and I have learned from it.  This is the first time I have faced a motion of no confidence or a motion of confidence in my career.  It forces me to reflect on the decisions I have made and the things I could have done differently and would do differently in future.<\/p>  <p>  We all know why Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a motion of no confidence.  Simply, it keeps the story in the public eye for another week.  It distracts from other issues Sinn F&eacute;in would rather not talk about.

Every flash of outrage, passionate speech and tear choked back is a tactical move.  Their spokespeople are articulate and confident but totally insincere.  When we make politics a game we devalue public life and let down the people we are meant to serve.  We are all guilty of it on occasion but I believe many of those opposite are guilty of it tonight.<\/p> <p> I wish to say a few things for the record.  The document was the terms of an agreement between Government and a representative body.  It was not a contract or was it a collective agreement in the normal sense.  Perhaps, that does not matter but it is important to state.  Multiple changes were made between the time of announcement and publication but these were not significant.  They were generally technical in nature and did not require Cabinet approval.  My decision to share the document with the then president of the NAGP had no impact on them.  Last Thursday, there was mention of a second document in the D&aacute;il.  We have established that this was a six-page summary attached to it.  I want to clarify there was no other occasion on which I shared a document with Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail.<\/p> <p> As I said last week, I spoke to the former president of the NAGP.  On the weekend the story broke, we did so on three occasions.  The first was a call from me to him on the Friday night when headlines appeared online.  The second was a call from me to him to try to ascertain the date on which I posted the document for my statement.  The third was contact from him about a statement the former officers of the NAGP were planning to issue.  I said I did not want to direct or advise him but made some factual observations.  I want to confirm that we have not been in contact in the nine days since.<\/p> <p> I also state categorically that the error in providing the document to Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail, notwithstanding my good reasons, was my own.  He is blameless in this regard.  He is responsible only of overstating the nature of his relationship with me and the level of his influence, and for sending some messages that were offensive and inappropriate.  Having said that, there are few in this House or across the land who would not be embarrassed about the content of messages they have sent to friends or co-workers believing them to be private or confidential.<\/p> <p> Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail is a good person, a good doctor and an effective advocate for general practice and for people and patients, especially during the pandemic.  I hope that can continue.  He is someone who is genuinely committed to providing basic healthcare to those who need it most in his charity work, namely, homeless people, members of the Travelling community, the Roma community and migrants.  I know that will continue.  Because some people believed he was close to me, they treated him as a pawn and then made him collateral damage.  This was raw politics at its most cruel.<\/p> <p> As Deputies will know by now, there is more to this story than the sharing of a confidential document.  I wish to speak about that for a moment.  Our democracy is strong but we are not immune from the corrosive forces being experienced in other established democracies.  I refer to fake news, conspiracy theories, the far right, the far left, unregulated fringe publications and unverified social media grievances, score-settling and smears masquerading as journalism, activism or some sort of anti-corruption crusade.  I ask Deputies to reflect on their engagement with these forces.  By giving them one's name and by repeating their claims, one gives them a legitimacy which diminishes this House.<\/p> <p> I wish to put on the record that many of the claims made about me were trumped-up or simply made-up.  Yesterday&rsquo;s article was just one example of this.  It alleged ten encounters, many of which simply did not and could not have happened, particularly as I was in Brussels on two occasions, Barcelona on one, out of Dublin on another or demonstrably doing Government business.  It claimed four meetings with the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Harris, which also never happened.  All could have been easily verified and checked if the truth mattered.  Truth did not matter, however, and was not the objective.<\/p> <p> Last week, I was asked to give a full and detailed account of my actions to the D&aacute;il and to set out the timelines.  I have done so.  As I said previously, my guiding principle today is the same as it was when I entered political life, that is, to serve my country to the best of my ability, to make a difference while I have an opportunity, to deal with the issues which affect the very future of our nation, like Covid-19 and Brexit, and to build a better society for us all post pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000035#KK00500","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1605032700,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 92;

The employer must ensure that the employee has been provided with the appropriate training before taking on the role.  The employer must also ensure that procedures are in place to identify workplace risks, with supports in place to avoid employees being affected by a workplace psycho-social hazard or stressor.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, every employer is legally obliged to carry out a risk assessment with a particular focus on work that may be hazardous to the worker and prepare a safety statement.  A written safety statement should set out how an employer will protect the safety and health of all employees and include an assessment of the risks involved.  Proper risk assessment along with mitigation measures, is the foundation for all workplace health and safety.<\/p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has an extensive range of advisory and guidance material available to all employers to assist them in putting in place measures to identify and manage specific psycho-social hazards.  Promoting positive mental health within the workplace is good for the employees, but it is also a factor in improving overall business performance.<\/p>  <p>  Any content moderator working for a social media platform, with a concern for his or her health and safety arising from the manner in which his or her work is organised, should contact the HSA in confidence.  On\u00a0foot of the Deputy's question, I made inquiries with the authority and I am informed that it has not received any queries relating to content.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigates the posting and circulation on social media platforms of certain acts and images of an explicit nature, which if found to be unlawful, can lead to prosecution.

I am not talking about the funny videos with headings such as, \"I did not go to work because a cat fell on my head and then a dog with shoes tried to do me justice.\"  I am talking about videos of very serious extreme violence, sexual abuse or child abuse, and videos of people being beheaded.  These people are subject to absolute trauma day in, day out and it is having a significant impact on their health.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that this new form of work would be recognised as such.  I do not think that the T&aacute;naiste intends to be unfair to them, but it is not fair to say they can go to the HSA or, indeed, to the Garda.  This is a workplace issue.

However, we must\u00a0seek to strike a balance as the closure of so many workplaces has had a real impact on footfall in our towns and cities.  We need to recognise that, depending on the job or role, remote working arrangements may not be ideal for all employers or employees.<\/p>  <p>  A right to request remote working exists in several countries, including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Finland.\u00a0 While the exact mechanics of the schemes vary, the basic concept is that a person who meets the legal definition of \"employee\" has the right to request remote working arrangements.\u00a0 The employer is not obliged to grant the request but is required to give it fair consideration and provide a reasonable explanation if they choose to reject it.  Certain eligibility requirements may also be provided for, such as a minimum length of service or limit on the frequency of such requests.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there is nothing in legislation that prevents an employee requesting the right to work remotely but I still think legislation is needed.\u00a0\u00a0I intend\u00a0to initiate a discussion on the concept of a right to request remote working with the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, and employer bodies\u00a0at the next meeting of the LEEF sub-group on employment, which I chair.  I will be interested to hear their views on what we can do to\u00a0further facilitate remote working in a way that works for businesses and staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000039#OO00800","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1605033900,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Maybe I misunderstood the T&aacute;naiste.  He said he wanted to initiate a conversation on the right to request remote working but we all have that right at the moment, although probably not in this job, admittedly.  However, in most other jobs, bar those where the employee's physical presence is required, people can request it.  The boss can just say \"No\", however.  Studies show that productivity has gone up but we also know that some employers are either nervous or unwilling to progress remote working.  I have previously said to the T&aacute;naiste that remote working needs to be recognised as a specific form of new work, just like shift work.  Shift work is recognised with shift patterns and premiums for working outside of normal hours.  Remote work is a separate form of work.  I think the T&aacute;naiste said he was worried at the beginning of the pandemic that people would not take to remote working.  They have really taken to it.  I take the T&aacute;naiste's point about the need for people to be out and about and the impact remote working will have.  I believe the vast majority of people will opt for a blended option where they will be in town sometimes.  We should also be having a conversation about hubs in our towns and villages to ensure people can work from home but also be in their town and out and about spending money.  That would be good all around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000039#OO00900","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1605033900,"counter":272,"content":"<p>It is true that anyone can request of his or her employer the option of working at home but it is not a legal right in the sense that I mean it.  At the moment, people can request term time or flexible hours, which is kind of what I have in mind in setting out a legal framework whereby people could request remote working of their employer and the employer would have to consider it properly and give reasons.  Presumably the employee would then be able to take the matter further if he or she were not happy with the response.  That is the kind of right we are talking and thinking about.  From the research we have done on people who are in jobs where there is remote working, roughly 10% to 15% are dying to get back to the office.  That may be for all sorts of reasons.  It could be related to personality or because the person is living in a crowded apartment.  About 15% are keen to stay at home and work from home all the time.  A good 70% want blended working and that is the way of the future.  I would like to create a legal framework around it so that employees have some legal basis and legal backing when they request remote working.  That does not mean we can force employers to do it.  Nobody is looking for that but we need a framework which gives employees some backing if they make such a request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000039#OO01000","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1605033900,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to start by doing a very simple thing.

We could spend all evening getting into why people's homes or apartments are overcrowded but the T&aacute;naiste is correct that plenty of people cannot work from home.  This is where some good work could be done with regard to hubs that would be based in villages and towns.  In my area in Balbriggan, a place he knows well, there is a place on the main street and it would be fantastic to have a facility and have people in the town spending money on their lunch break.  This can work as an idea for blended working.  I welcome the fact that he is committed to doing this and we in Sinn F&eacute;in will commit to working with him to ensure this is done speedily.  We need to place a little bit more emphasis on the obligations of the employer to provide this.  This cannot just be a one-way street in giving people the right to ask.

We recognise, as the T&aacute;naiste said, the pressure that this has put the retail sector under and that this is a very difficult for retail businesses, whether local producers or otherwise.  It is difficult, which is the reason we are working with the sector to support it and help it through this very difficult time.

The difficulty is that the more we allow to open, the more interactions there will be.  It is not that the person may necessarily pick up the virus in the shoe shop from another customer or the sales assistant.  It is that such people go into town, meet somebody at the bus stop, meet other people on the bus, may stop for a coffee, go in, buy shoes and then go home on the bus and do the same thing again.  Cutting out certain activities and preventing people from mixing and mingling reduces the number of potential interactions.

Many are in the arts and tourism sectors and they are going to be helped out through a different fund and budget under the control of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  If, however, we find businesses that fall between schemes and get no grant, we will try to come up with a solution for them.  I hate the term \"under constant review\" but the scheme is one of those schemes we accept will need to be amended as we go along so businesses that have been closed can get a grant and survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000046#VV01100","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1605038700,"counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000047#WW00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug and Alcohol Testing","time":1605038700,"counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000047#WW00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1605038700,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, this issue is becoming more prevalent.  It was raised at joint policing committee, JPC, briefings by Garda Superintendent Gerard Roche in the Limerick city division.  He stated that, aside from what people would traditionally know as drink-driving, there had been an increase in the phenomenon known as drug-driving.  He has requested more testing equipment.  Currently, the division has only five machines, four of which are mobile and the fifth one being static.  The Garda has applied for a further six machines.<\/p>  <p>  The statistics are stark.  From January to September, the ratio of detections for drug-driving compared with drink-driving was virtually 50:50.  There were 128 drink-driving detections, an increase of 12% on last year's figure, but the 121 drug-driving detections represented a 128% increase year on year.  This major surge occurred during the Covid period.  More alarming was what happened during June and September.  In June, there were 22 drug-driving detections and 19 drink-driving detections.  In September, drug-driving detections numbered nearly three times more than drink-driving detections at 22 versus eight.<\/p>  <p>  People need to be aware that, for a first drug-driving offence, drivers lose their licences and are disqualified from driving for four years.  They lose their jobs as well.  People might believe they will not be caught drug-driving after a certain time, but a drug, be it cannabis or cocaine, can stay in a driver's system for up to three or four weeks.  The consequences are significant.  People will automatically be disqualified for four years for a first offence.  They will lose their jobs in many, if not nearly all, cases.<\/p>  <p>  Will resources be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Limerick to increase the number of machines for testing for drug-driving from the current five to 11?  This is a growing phenomenon and education is needed.  Garda&iacute; in Limerick are looking for extra resources.  Nothing I say takes away from the issue of drink-driving, which is equally as bad, but drug-driving is increasing significantly if the Limerick statistics are anything to go by.  We are looking for funding for an extra six drug testing machines so that garda&iacute; can do their job and ensure that people are not driving under the influence of drugs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000047#WW00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1605038700,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this serious and important issue.  While the Garda has been testing drivers for drugs with the assistance of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, since 1999, the Deputy will be aware that the drug-driving provisions in the Road Traffic Act 2016 were only commenced by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on 12 April 2017.  The Deputy has outlined some of its measures and, indeed, consequences if people are caught.  One of the legislation's key measures provides for preliminary drug testing, which enables garda&iacute; to test motorists at the roadside whom they suspect of driving under the influence of drugs.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can establish roadside checkpoints, known as mandatory intoxicant testing checkpoints or MITs, to test drivers for the presence of alcohol and drugs.  The operation of MITs and the enforcement of road traffic legislation are operational matters for the Garda Commissioner.  The Deputy will appreciate that I as Minister have no role in these matters.  However, I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of all resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure their optimum use.  I am also assured that this is the case in Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforcement figures indicate that 1,216 drug-driving arrests were made in the first six months of 2020, an astonishing figure compared with the 591 in the first half of 2018.  This represents an increase of 106% in drug-driving arrests despite a 70% reduction in traffic during the period of the Covid-19 restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has committed to ensuring that the Garda has the maximum level of resources available to perform its policing duties.  The Garda has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021.  It is anticipated that each county, including Limerick, will benefit from this additional funding, some of which I will outline now.  This level of funding is enabling sustained and ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff first and foremost, given how important it is to ensure that these duties can be carried out.  As a result, there are approximately 14,600 Garda members and more than 3,000 Garda staff nationwide.  Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to 620 new garda&iacute; and an extra 500 Garda staff.  This recruitment is supporting the redeployment of garda&iacute; from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and expertise can be used to best effect.  An additional &euro;22 million has been provided for Garda ICT, bringing the total allocation to more than &euro;70 million for the second year in a row.  There will also be continued investment in the Garda fleet of &euro;8 million.  This is in addition to the highest ever investment of approximately &euro;15 million in the Garda transport fleet in 2020, a portion of which relates to the Garda Covid response.  I anticipate that all of this additional funding will be spread depending on where the Commissioner and his team know resources are required.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides the Garda with a significant resource allocation to support its vital enforcement role on our roads.  Drug-driving not only puts drivers at risk but also passengers and other road users.  Preliminary drug testing strengthens the Garda's ability to tackle drug-driving and I am committed to supporting this important statutory enforcement provision in my role as Minister for Justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000047#WW00400","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1605038700,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Minister also mentioned that there had been a reduction in traffic levels due to Covid.  One can only imagine what the detection rates would have been had we normal driving patterns.<\/p>  <p>  This appears to be a growing feature on our roads.

We have tried our best in this year's budget to ensure that is the case.  The fact that we have an unprecedented budget this year of &euro;1.952 billion will allow us to address some of these concerns.<\/p> <p> I share the concerns of Deputy O'Donnell.  The figures are frightening, especially given the amount of traffic on the road has decreased significantly.  I wish to emphasise the fact that the Garda is not only seeing an increase of this type of crime.  The force has been able to identify other areas as well.  As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recommenced Operation Fanacht on 22 October.  The Garda has continued its role in the operation and has looked to prevent and detect crime on our roads.  In the first seven days of Garda operations, a total of 71 crimes were recorded in the course of the Covid-19 operations that were not related to breaches of regulations.  These were mainly road traffic and drug-related.  The Garda is focused on this.  This is a priority for the Garda even though the force is focused on Covid-19 as well.<\/p> <p> The Deputy should note that the Road Safety Authority launched a public consultation to inform the development of the fifth Government road safety strategy that will run from 2021 to 2030.  This is something I have no doubt the Garda will address and take on board.  I will pass on the Deputy's comments about education.  One of the effective tools in recent years has been advertising.  Although they can be difficult and upsetting to watch, the advertisements clearly showing the damage that can be done on our roads are effective.  When it comes to drugs, it is no different.  I look forward to working with the Garda as it implements the strategy and, most important, I will ensure it has the resources to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000047#WW00600","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","time":1605039300,"counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000048#XX00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1605039300,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, for being here to take this Topical Issue.  This matter is of crucial importance for many people who have applied for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, but who have encountered what can only be described as a bureaucratic mess.<\/p><p>Initially, the pandemic unemployment payment was a flat-rate payment of &euro;350 per week.  It provided solace and support to tens of thousands of workers and business people who had been forced to close their doors.  The Government decided to amend the PUP from a flat rate of &euro;350 for every individual who applied to a tiered system that resulted in different payments depending on people's previous salaries.  Difficulties have arisen predominantly, it appears, for small business owners in respect of whom the Department does not have a clear or immediate access to PRSI contributions.  This could have and should have been identified as an issue prior to the new system being introduced and prior to the most recent lockdown and restriction measures.<\/p><p>After the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, decided to kick about the National Public Health Emergency Team on live television with regard to its recommendations for level 5, the Government subsequently moved to exactly that position a short time later.  The rationale given by the Government at the time was to ensure that the additional time as a result of the delay was to ensure all measures could be put in place to support small business owners and people who might be affected economically.  In that regard, it was a downright disaster for many of the people who have been in contact with me.  Shortly after the new regime came into place, I received an email from a constituent of the Minister and of mine.  It stated that due to phase 4 restrictions, the business was forced to close on Friday 16 October.  The person applied online for the PUP and received an email on the Friday evening stating the person was not entitled to the payment but to forward any documents to a different email address.  The person checked online at <i>www.mywelfare.ie<\/i>but there was no notification looking for the person's documents.  There was only a notification stating that the application was being processed.  There was also a warning notification stating that the MyGovID service does not send details asking for financial or personal documents to be emailed.  I could read dozens of similar emails that I have received.  I could read dozens of text messages and relay dozens of telephone calls I have had with distressed people.  These are predominantly people like hairdressers.  Quite a number of them are small business owners.  They were forced to close their doors as a result of the Government decision.  The Government did not have the work done to provide them with supports.<\/p><p>Many of the cases that have been brought to my attention have been resolved following interaction with the Department.  I thank the Minister's staff who are involved in this area in that regard.  Yet, people should not have to go to their local politician to get what they are entitled to in respect of Covid assistance.  It should be provided readily.  Measures need to be put in place to resolve that.<\/p><p>Will the Minister ensure that the anomalies clearly in place are resolved for all outstanding applicants?  Will the Minister ensure that the anomaly whereby many employers who have been forced to close their doors and who have been put on a reduced payment is resolved?  We have the ludicrous situation in our county where employers have had to close their doors and they are on payments lower than those of their workers as a result of this debacle.  Finally, will the Minister give clarification on the PUP recipients from the initial stage in March, April and May?  Will the Minister clarify the position on those owed arrears in PUP?

The pandemic unemployment payment has been a vital support for hundreds of thousands of workers and their families throughout Covid-19.  Since March, my Department has issued over 12 million payments to over 800,000 people.  A total of &euro;4 billion has been paid out under the scheme to date.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the staff in the Department of Social Protection for the extraordinary work they have put in since March to ensure that payments have been issued quickly to those who need them.  This demonstrates what public service is all about.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the matter he has raised today does not relate to errors in the records of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Department uses earnings data supplied by the Revenue Commissioners for 2019 and 2020 in the case of employees and for 2018 and 2019 in the case of self-employed people for the pandemic unemployment payment.  Where difficulties in verifying records have arisen in a small number of cases, it is typically due to outstanding or late returns or delays or non-compliance in the recording or reporting of income and earnings to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that if a person is working or self-employed, that person is liable to pay PRSI.  It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that a person claiming the pandemic unemployment payment would have a recent and verifiable record of PRSI.  Where a person has applied for the PUP and my Department cannot find any record of PRSI contributions or earnings, the Department contacts the person concerned and asks the person to submit evidence of employment, for example, a payslip.  Where the person provides evidence, the claim is put into payment as quickly as possible, generally within a week of receiving the information.  Dedicated teams are in place in my Department to follow up on all replies as quickly as possible.  I am glad that many of the instances Deputy Carthy raised were subsequently resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The staff of my Department are working morning, noon and night to process payments efficiently and quickly.  Since the start of October alone, they have processed and paid over 200,000 new PUP claimants.  I wish to put that in context.  This is the equivalent to a full year claim load in a normal year.<\/p>  <p>  It is always the case when processing such a large volume of claims that there will inevitably be some cases not paid as quickly as others due to incomplete or missing information or simply because a person does not satisfy the eligibility criteria.  As I have said, where that happens my Department contacts the individuals concerned.  When the necessary information is submitted, the applicant is put into payment as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to say my Department has been working very hard on getting the arrears issue resolved.

When that happens the Department contacts the individuals involved, and when they provide the necessary information they are put into payment.  It is important as well to point out that some people do not reply at all.  That would tell me that they know they are not entitled to a payment.  In fairness, we need checks and balances in place because at the end of the day this is taxpayers' money.

The people I represent are extremely disappointed with the customer service Eir is providing and its approach to the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  I receive complaints daily about the way Eir treats its customers and the manner in which it is supposedly connecting rural Ireland to high-speed fibre broadband.  Eir regularly shows a complete and utter disregard for the concerns of the ordinary person in rural Ireland, its customers.  This cannot continue.  We expect people to work, to study from home and to live in rural Ireland with ease and comfort, yet Eir continues to disregard and ignore the needs and requests of its customers without the slightest bit of concern for the best interests of rural Ireland, in spite its being awarded a contract worth &euro;900 million.<\/p>  <p>  I will provide a number of examples in my constituency that prove the way Eir is treating its customers.  One woman in the Thurles area contacted me stating she had tried and failed on numerous occasions to cancel her landline contract with Eir.  Every time she called customer service she was left on hold for up to an hour.  She was not able to cancel her plan for months, despite her best efforts.  Then Eir turned around and informed her that she owed a bill of over &euro;100 for that period.  Her line had given her problems, she got fed up trying to get it fixed, she tried to cancel her plan and she met roadblock after roadblock with Eir's customer service.  This is not acceptable.  It would be laughable if it were not so frustrating for people in rural areas.  I have a constituent in Portroe who lives just off the main road to Ballina.  She is a teacher and during the first lockdown she had to teach a number of her classes from her car as there was so little reception in her house.  Eir has run the broadband route along the main road in this area but not down its back roads.  This means that this woman's neighbours can access high-speed broadband, work from home, study from home and live comfortably in their homes but she and her family do not enjoy the same connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000049#YY00700","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1605039900,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I, too, have been inundated with calls from my constituents about the poor state of broadband in County Carlow.

Now more than ever, a robust Internet connection is required for all constituents working from home and also to prevent isolation in these challenging times.  It is important for us to keep connected, and there is an urgency around this matter.  There are parts of Carlow where people are really struggling to get basic-level Internet to carry out normal day-to-day tasks, and this needs to change.  I welcomed the announcement in June of &euro;32 million for broadband in Carlow, and I know that National Broadband Ireland has requested a licence from Carlow County Council for road openings and that it is now surveying parts of Bagenalstown, Borris, Tinnahinch, Myshall - that whole area.  That is welcome but, again, there is the problem of communication and information.  I see a website has been set up with a search tool to enable the public to check whether their premises are within the roll-out area and to show the dates for the areas being surveyed.  The website can be updated and there are numbers people can ring.  It is so important now that every house has broadband.  If we have learnt anything from Covid-19, it is the importance of having good broadband for working from home, whether for students, teachers or anyone else.  They need proper broadband.

County Tipperary is as much an important part of the national band plan as County Carlow or, indeed, any other county.  I look forward to providing details of the same investment we are going to have to make in that county.  That does not excuse or remove Eir from the necessity to start providing customer service in a way it is not and so that its reputation is not being damaged by the level of delay.  As Deputy Cahill said, customers are finding it difficult to even make contact with the company.<\/p>  <p>  I will say to both Deputies that the whole project is aimed at getting broadband connectivity to every single house in the country.  The national broadband plan was set out as a seven-year project.  We will see if we can shorten that.  I believe that is possible, primarily, because the demand for the product now will make a real business case for National Broadband Ireland to connect as many houses as quickly as it can.<\/p>  <p>  Post-Covid, this habit of remote working or working from home will be embedded into everyday society.  We will, perhaps, see that rather than working or commuting five days a week people might commute three or four days a week, and those one or two days at home will be facilitated by having broadband.  Having a complete national roll-out whereby no house or area is left behind facilitates it.  The key measure of success will be not just getting to where broadband passes the house but with the householders taking it on.  That will be an imperative now post-Covid.  I hope that is the greatest stimulus to accelerating the roll-out.<\/p>  <p>  In other areas we are relying on Eir, which is rolling out high-speed broadband in significant parts of rural Ireland.  It is ahead of schedule on that.  As Deputy Cahill said, it may have a problem with its customer service but the quality of the actual broadband when it is introduced is this fast-fibre high-speed connectivity.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned other providers.  SIRO, for example, is another company rolling out high-speed broadband in other towns, villages and cities across the country.  We have, therefore, an effective roll-out happening.  I want to see it happen faster but that does not absolve the companies while operating it from making sure their customer relations are working effectively.

Those children are not getting home until close to 6 p.m., having waited in the cold, and must then eat their dinner and do their homework.  Some students have to walk 1 or 2 miles further down the road to see whether there is an emptier bus that they can board.  Students have reported as many as 15 buses passing by as they stand waiting.  Some bus drivers allow passengers to get off their bus but do not allow the schoolchildren to board.  There is an obvious and very real safety risk that comes with having schoolchildren standing at the side of the road in wet, cold and inclement conditions.  The situation in the morning is equally as bad as in the evening, which is resulting in children arriving to school late and missing their first class, with all the consequences that go with that.  I am interested to hear how the Minister intends to rectify this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000050#ZZ01200","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605041100,"counter":392,"content":"<p>The Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenues.  The Government has committed to ensuring essential transport services are protected and supported for the duration of the level 5 restrictions.  The continued operation of public transport is vital and, as such, it is designated among the essential services that have carried on through the crisis.  I thank both the public and commercial operators and their staff for their ongoing work in providing this vital service.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services through the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures throughout the network.  The Government's living with Covid plan clearly sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the five risk levels.  The plan also provides guidance for the public on using public transport at the different risk levels, including a stipulation that wearing face coverings is mandatory and encouraging use of off-peak services and sustainable active travel options where feasible.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the rising incidence of Covid-19 infections, for a period of six weeks from midnight on 21 October, the Government introduced level 5 restrictions for the whole country.  At the current level of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  The plan's guidance on working from home where possible and the closure of social, leisure and other facilities have reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it, including front-line workers and, critically, students.  The move to 25% capacity utilisation on public transport is one of a suite of measures introduced under level 5 following recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.<\/p>  <p>  Issues arising from the reduction in capacity presented on some services at the commencement of level 5, especially on early morning bus services in the Dublin region.  Both my Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA, are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  Since the move to level 5, the NTA and the bus operators in Dublin, Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland, have reallocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas that are experiencing capacity issues.  Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since 22 October to mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops.  Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures are assisting in reducing passengers waiting at stops.  Currently, all available vehicles are in use.  While the reallocation will ease the situation, it remains the case that there will be instances of people having to wait for another bus.  The advice is, as I said, to try to avail of other modes of transport, if possible, and to bear in mind that journeys may take longer at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA is monitoring very closely the effects of the reduction in capacity, in conjunction with the public transport operators.  They will continue to take direction on this matter from the relevant Government emergency planning bodies, including the Department of Health and NPHET.  Any actions being undertaken by the NTA and the public transport operators will be guided by those agencies and the advice of the Chief Medical Officer.<\/p>  <p>  We are very aware that this is a real issue for people, especially in Dublin and, in particular, for students.  It was especially bad in the first few days of the level 5 restrictions but it improved slightly in the second week.  We are monitoring the situation week by week.  Dublin Bus has done a remarkable job, not only in putting on additional buses but also in terms of its workers coming in to do earlier shifts to cope with the morning peak in demand.  I have been talking to both Dublin Bus and the NTA about this and they are very aware of the difficulties.  The tradition and attitude in Dublin Bus is that one does not leave a child at a bus stop.  Drivers have a huge responsibility in this area and it is not easy.  That is the culture in the company and I hope it helps to alleviate the current difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000051#AAA00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1605041100,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I am afraid it does not alleviate them.  When the Minister came off script at the end of his reply, he was a bit more honest about what is happening.  I fully appreciate that the culture of Dublin Bus is not to leave any child at a bus stop.  The drivers make a remarkable contribution to our city.  They are generally friendly and reliable.  However, at this time of level 5 restrictions, there is a very serious difficulty in that there are simply not enough buses to operate at 25% capacity.  As a result, children are being left at bus stops in the morning, afternoon and evening.  They are being left to walk in the rain and cold.  We are facing into another three weeks of level 5 lockdown, which means another three weeks of this problem continuing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister talked about monitoring the situation but there is not really time to do so.  We have been told throughout the pandemic that it is important to act swiftly.  I am not sure what that looks like in terms of devising more of a Dunkirk strategy that would see as many buses as possible, private or otherwise, reallocated to come into service.  The current situation is simply untenable.  In a few weeks we will be coming out of a lockdown that was shorter than the first one and we hope to see an increase in capacity.  The problem, however, is that we could be back to level 5 in January.  The current situation is causing untold hardship in schools every morning, with children coming in late and wet from the rain.  The same thing is happening on their journey home.  I do not doubt for a second that the Minister is taking this issue very seriously but the outcome needs to be a lot better.  The situation that is arising at bus stops throughout the city, from Monday to Friday, is not tenable and it is not fair.

Under the level 5 restrictions, bus services are reduced to 25% capacity.  That is the real difficulty.  We are reviewing the situation on an ongoing basis but any change must be agreed by the public health officials and they do not want to change the rules and standards in the middle of a period of restrictions at a particular level.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, there was a particular problem with bus services in the first few days of the level 5 restrictions when the numbers of buses in operation reduced.  The numbers have been rising again in recent days.  The Deputy is relating what people are experiencing as they go about their daily lives.  Drivers have a certain amount of discretion as to whom they allow to board their buses but we do not want to put the whole of that huge responsibility on them.  They have to make a call and we will back up the drivers in whatever approach they take.  We have discussed other options with the NTA and other ways of making this very difficult situation better.  There is no easy solution other than possibly going back to NPHET and agreeing a different public health approach.  That is not an easy thing to do at this time.  We will look at the bus transport situation as part of the ongoing review of level 5 restrictions.  There may be an opportunity at the interim review to change things.<\/p>  <p>  There is a further issue to consider when we come out of level 5, when even the 50% capacity limit will present real difficulties as we start to return to normal.  We are a slight outlier in Europe in that we probably have more restrictive measures in place than is the case in other countries.  A lot of the safety issues surrounding public transport are to do with the level of mask-wearing.  Compliance in this regard is pretty universal in our case.  Another factor is how passengers behave and manage their own safety.  Again, most people in this country are very conscious of the issues and are acting in a way that is very sensible.  The review we are doing will be concerned not just with what we are doing at the current level of restrictions, which in the case of public transport involve a 25% capacity limit, but what we can do when we get back to levels 2 and 3, where we will probably find that the 50% limit is causing difficulties.<\/p> <p>We do not want people to leave public transport completely.  At the same time, we want to do the right thing in public health safety terms.  That is the difficult balance we have to get right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000051#AAA00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Questions (Resumed) - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1605041700,"counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000052#BBB00225"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","time":1605041700,"counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000052#BBB00250"},{"type":"question","time":1605041700,"counter":399,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[35129\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000052#BBB00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the concerns and suggestions brought forward by stakeholders and experts at the pre-legislative scrutiny meetings on the climate action and low carbon development (amendment) Bill at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action; his plans to amend the Bill to take account of these concerns and suggestions to strengthen the Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1605041700,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I want to ask the Minister about the climate action and low carbon development (amendment) Bill.

In a visit to me, his primary message was that they are looking to achieve a more ambitious national declared contribution sooner than 2060 to net zero.  I believe that has been helped by the European Union taking the position it has in going for the higher targets that we mentioned with Deputy O'Rourke earlier.  This virtuous circle, I hope, in terms of the increased ambition from Europe, faster ambition from China and now America pledging to come back within the international agreement, gives us some hope that there might be a race to the top rather than a race to the bottom.

The statement also noted that data centres pose considerable challenges to the future planning and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s power system.  Such challenges arise in terms of renewable energy policy, generation adequacy, security of electricity supply and electricity customer costs.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to developing efficiency standards for equipment and processes, particularly those set to grow rapidly, such as data centres.  The ICT sector needs to undergo its own green transformation.  Earlier this year, the European Commission adopted Shaping Europe's Digital Future, which includes an objective to foster an open, democratic and sustainable society.  Key actions include initiatives to achieve climate-neutral, highly energy efficient and sustainable data centres by no later than 2030.  I note that the EU ecodesign regulation on servers and data storage products sets minimum standards around the environmental impact of these products and requires that circular economy principles will be mandatory for suppliers of this type of equipment from next year. <\/p>  <p>  The climate action plan also provides that the IDA will use its new strategy for 2020 to 2024 to fully integrate decarbonisation objectives across its portfolio of clients.  This strategy will seek to ensure new large-scale enterprise investments in Ireland, including factors such as location and power purchase agreement opportunities, are aligned with the build-out of the grid to maximise renewable sources.  We have seen recently a number of unsubsidised corporate power purchase agreements, purchased by data centre operators, in the Irish market and I hope we can encourage more.  When data centre operators purchase electricity directly from renewable generators, it contributes towards the State objective to decarbonise our electricity system without any subsidy from electricity customers. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government&rsquo;s climate action fund is supporting South Dublin County Council to develop an innovative district heating project in the Tallaght area, using waste heat from a local data centre.  The Tallaght district heating scheme will provide low carbon heat to public sector, residential and commercial customers, with the objective of decreasing the level of emissions associated with the use of fossil fuels for heating.  This project will provide valuable information in regard to the synergies between district heating and waste heat recovery from a data centre.  This will inform future policy for the use of waste heat in appropriate locations and where technically feasible. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the relevant energy bodies to implement the commitments in the climate action plan and the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000055#EEE00800","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1605043500,"counter":447,"content":"<p>The Tallaght district heating scheme is very welcome and is something we support.

We are already Europe&rsquo;s data centre capital, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft having operations here.  Dozens of centres have opened in recent years, bringing the total to 54.  We have ten centres under construction, including a &euro;1 billion Amazon hub in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, and another 31 centres have planning permission.<\/p>  <p>  These centres do not get the same attention as the agriculture industry, the aviation industry or the fossil fuel industry but they should and, in fact, they should get more attention.  They are jobs poor and carbon heavy.

Looking at the use of electricity across a range of different sectors, we have seen significant growth of our economy without a commensurate growth in electricity.

This intervention will result in 90 additional high-power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles, 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers, and 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology, with each consisting of two charge points.<\/p>  <p>  Since the delivery stage of the product commenced in October 2019, four multicharger sites have been delivered, one each on motorways in Galway, Kildare, Laois and Meath.  The programme to upgrade 50 standard chargers to fast chargers has already commenced with 13 installations now in place.  In addition, 159 standard chargers, each with two charge points, have been replaced, bringing the total number of those chargers nationally to 318.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides support to the SEAI public charge points scheme.  This scheme provides funding to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers.  The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which would facilitate owners of EVs who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on the public street to charge their EVs near their homes.  A total of 75% of the capital cost is provided through a grant up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per charging point.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support this scheme through the grants provided by the SEAI and in parallel is developing a charging infrastructure strategy in line with the programme for Government.  This will ensure capacity keeps ahead of demand, while also putting in place guidance for local authorities on how best to expand the network of public charge points at local, national and regional levels.<\/p>  <p>  Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments.  However, there are a number of complex planning and legal issues to address before we can expand the grant in an appropriate manner so as to include the required categories of shared parking.  My Department is working closely with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address the issues.<\/p>  <p>  On new build, it should be noted that the EU energy performance and buildings directive requires member states to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is installed in all new residential and non-residential buildings as well as those buildings with more than ten car parking spaces for the purpose of enabling the installation of a larger stage of charging points for electric vehicles.  It is intended that the EU requirement will be transposed into Irish law by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the schemes outlined above, the Department of Transport is also undertaking an EV small public service vehicles, SPSV, charger project, which will see the installation of SPSV-dedicated EV chargers at Dublin and Cork airports and at Heuston train station in Dublin, Colbert train station in Limerick and Kent train station in Cork.

A revised licence was issued in 2006 but the EPA then had to take court action in 2009 because there was significant odour pollution at the site.

We have seen a range of initiatives carried out through our post offices which have helped to support local communities, the elderly and vulnerable.  However, the serious decline in the volume of mail and the impact of Covid-19 on footfall through post offices has had a severe impact on the postal network.  I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU.  I am also aware of the findings of the Grant Thornton report, which was commissioned by the IPU.<\/p>  <p>  It is a long-standing policy of the Government that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government.  However, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.  The programme for Government recognises that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise, as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network.<\/p>  <p>  An Post put in place a strategic plan, covering the period from 2017 to 2021, in response to the structural challenges faced by the postal sector.  In order to implement the plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of &euro;150 million, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of &euro;30 million to the company in December 2017.  The cost of supporting the renewal of the post office network was &euro;15 million and the continued fulfilment of a five-day mail delivery service cost another &euro;15 million.  As part of the delivery of the plan, the company was split into two distinct business units - An Post Mails and Parcels, and An Post Retail.<\/p>  <p>  An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats.  Among other things, it is diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides to individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, it is offering local banking in association with the major banks, and it is providing a full range of State savings products.  Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, have been launched.  An Post's investment of &euro;50 million in the network is about getting communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.<\/p>  <p>  The Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and to make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland.  With an evolving mandate, An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services.  We will work closely with An Post to see if there is scope to channel additional services through the network.

I appreciate that the Minister's Department is considering the Grant Thornton report, but we need to do more in the current climate, given the crisis we are experiencing now.  This is an important issue, as acknowledged by the Minister.  The post office is a vital service in many towns and communities throughout the country, particularly in rural areas.  As the Minister has mentioned, during the Covid-19 lockdown the post office assumed the role of a social contact and provided a reassuring knock on the door for many people, especially our elderly and vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  The post office is at a critical juncture.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, its transactions are estimated to have decreased by approximately 25%.  I acknowledge that it is a long-standing Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government.  However, we find ourselves in unprecedented times.  In 2017, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of &euro;30 million to the company to support the renewal of the post office network and its continued fulfilment of a five-day mail service.

An additional cost of &euro;6 million has been incurred in post offices to pay for PPE and other protection measures.  There has been a further acceleration of the decline in mail revenues and volumes.  Traditionally, in recent years, it was declining by approximately 7% per annum.  The decrease has been closer to 10% or 15% this year.  As in many other sectors, business is down.  The factor that compensates for this is that revenues from the parcel business are up 100%.

Rather than repeat what was said in the debate last week I will focus on a different aspect today.  The national broadband plan is under way, which is great, and we want it to happen as quickly and effectively as possible, but is there merit in also looking at measures to complement that and to make it easier for private or public providers to get in alongside that to allow for greater coverage penetration?  In the previous D&aacute;il I introduced the broadband planning framework Bill to enable that.  It was working its way through the Houses before the D&aacute;il was dissolved.  The type of things it sought to do included planning synchronisation across different planning authorities; a register of assets that would be maintained by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg; a central depository where kit and infrastructure would be re-used if it is already in place; mandating site sharing so if there is already a mast or a duct on a particular hillside or road it would be re-used rather than reinventing the wheel; and ducting to the door, which may be of interest to the Minister, in that a change in the planning mandate that ducting be provided to the door be part of that new build planning framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000059#JJJ00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1605045900,"counter":492,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely right that we should not simply rest on our laurels or wait for the national broadband plan and not do anything else.  There are large areas in other parts of the country not in the intervention area and we have to have an eye on them.  Competition does help here, particularly where a technology evolves.  There may be innovation occurring in fixed wireless or other wireless systems that may even move into areas we had not expected.  We should certainly encourage and support that without interfering directly in the market.<\/p>  <p>  The way the national broadband area is configured is, by tradition, more rural.  In terms of the way the previous agreement was done with Eir, the first surrounding area around a town would typically be an Eir area where it is rolling out high speed broadband very successfully, even if its customer service is letting it down.  The area beyond that then is the national broadband area.  It is not just the national broadband plan.  We also tend to have Eir doing the hinterland area around most towns.  In the larger towns and cities we tend to have competition, be it from the cable provider or a range of different providers including SIRO, Eir and a number of others, so it would be more difficult in rural Ireland.

I welcome the Minister's commitment to accommodate competition in that space because I believe that competition lifts all boats.  It is important to have a technology mix also because the NBP is predicated upon a fibre infrastructure, which we know is currently the scientifically fastest option, but from a practical point of view I refer to the likes of fixed wireless, which the Minister mentioned, although not satellite, which can create an expense.

There was not a blind spot ruling out fixed wireless but if I remember rightly they found a difficulty with the configuration, particularly of our pole network along the roads, and getting an equivalent high quality provision using fixed wireless.  No matter how many shared masts or other fixed wireless configurations there were they found it very difficult to get the coverage in with the dispersed nature in hollows, behind hills and so on in terms of one-off rural housing.
