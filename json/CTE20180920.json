I sent out a draft timetable indicating that we would deal with the work programme and certain items of correspondence and that at 10 a.m. we would move on to NAMA.  I propose that, when we finish with NAMA, maybe before the vote, we conclude the meeting and hold over the correspondence until next week.  There is a large volume of correspondence.  We might get some dealt with before 10 a.m.  What we get done will be well and good.  We will hold over the remainder.  I printed off what we got.

There are three items that could be dealt with next week.  One is the issue of Vote 1 - President's Establishment, which is very time sensitive with an election around the corner.  The second item is the issue of CervicalCheck, on which there is correspondence with which we need to deal this morning.  The third item is an invitation from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, to the PAC and several other Oireachtas committees and Departments to talk about government accounting.  We will come to that.  They propose a meeting next Wednesday morning.  A representative delegation from the committee will meet the OECD.  Those three items have to be dealt with immediately.  I just want to clear the minutes first.  Are the minutes of 12 July 2018 agreed with no matters arising?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We turn back now to the work programme.  There are three time sensitive issues on the work programme.  I have a note on the file that we can note and publish on the request to discuss Vote 1, which is expenditure on the President's Establishment reported in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report every year.  I have received a lot of requests as Chairman for that to be considered.  I propose we consider it, as people have said it is not available under freedom of information but is within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the committee were seen to not want to discuss the matter, it might raise even more significant questions than any questions we might get answered if we had a discussion.  In view of the fact that nominations close next Wednesday, next Tuesday is the last possible day on which we can go there.  I would not be comfortable having a meeting on the issue after the close of nominations at all.  I do not think anyone would want to be here two weeks before an election campaign discussing the matter.  If we are to do it, we have to get it out of the way promptly.<\/p> <p>  Strictly, it will be the Accounting Officer only in relation to expenditure.  I would not allow any question to be directed involving the President.  The President is not answerable to the House, which is a long-standing principle that we will honour entirely.  If anyone asks a question about what the President did or did not do, I will rule it out of order.  The Accounting Officer will be here to answer and Mr. Seamus McCarthy has published his report from the previous year.  The most recent report will not be out until next week.  As such, we will have to go with the most up-to-date information we have.  The secretariat was in touch with Mr. Martin Fraser, the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, who is the Accounting Officer.  We would invite him.  There is a letter from him on file in which he raises some points and which we can note, publish and put up on screen.  It is No. 1557.  We can deal with the those points now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>What is the logic or reasoning behind examining this in the first place?

I ask Mr. McCarthy to outline what that distinction is.  I have no difficult with us doing it.  We should do it quickly if it is the first chapter.

I am sure we are equally proud of all our Presidents.  I do have a problem with Mr. Fraser's letter.  He quotes the Constitution in it and, frankly, he is wrong.  He suggested that this is unconstitutional.  At no time are we seeking to question the powers or functions of any President or the execution of same, nor would we.  The Chairman quite rightly pointed out that any such questions would be offside.  I agree that is appropriate.  However, the tone of the letter did bother me.  It then goes on to say that, if we do this, it would in some way undermine the impartiality of the Civil Service.  I resent that suggestion because I do not see how that would remotely be the case.  In fact, my interpretation is the converse of that.  Here we have a senior civil servant seeking to direct the operations of the committee.  I have a real problem with that.  We should go ahead.  We should do it.  We should keep the questioning very much to the question of where the money goes and what happens to it.  It is a matter of public interest.  When people see the value for money they are getting - indeed the 10% surrender and coming in under budget is an example to all Departments - it might even encourage more people to engage in the democratic opportunity that is before us in October.  I thank Mr. Fraser for the advice but it is flawed and incorrect.  Under no circumstances are we seeking to undermine his impartiality or that of other civil servants in the political process.  I cannot say the same for this letter in terms of how it looks to me.  It seems he is seeking to influence our particular view.

We can see that even at the front gates outside the D&aacute;il yesterday; at the Ploughing Championships, if anyone was there; and at events before that.  I have a huge concern that this could, in effect, compromise that democratic process.  I am all for transparency, but we are now so close to a presidential election that if we discuss the Vote here it will really impact on that election.  It is very hard to have demarcation lines in terms of the expenditure in Vote 1 that have nothing to do with President Higgins.  We have seen how difficult it can get in respect of these inquiries in other countries.  I am very concerned that it can get very highly charged in this room.

What is the rush to do it now?  Anyone who is watching these proceedings and who does not think there is some form of political capital to be gained, maybe outside this room, from this going ahead now is not being realistic.<\/p> <p>  Of course it will be impossible for the Chairman to unsay things that will be said in here that are linked to a candidate who is currently in office.  The Chairman needs to think about that.  He will not be able to unsay those things.  The media will not be able to unreport those things.  As a consequence, this rubbish about doing it before the closing date is irrelevant and insincere.  I am not referring to the Chairman, but people are saying this.  This campaign is up and running.  It is everywhere.  It is the most dominant story across the media and has been for weeks and months.  I am not finished.  The fact is that this is an ongoing campaign.  If we are going to jump into this now, it will really say an awful lot about this committee, about its priorities and about the fact that, from a political point of view, while we might leave our jerseys outside the door - I believe that and I share Deputy MacSharry's faith in it - the Chairman will not be able to unsay things said inside here, to unlink them from one candidate or to stop them being reported in the media.  That will be damaging to this committee and will have an impact on the presidential election.  We damn well better think about this very clearly and we better get legal advice because I do not want to be associated with a committee that goes down that road without its eyes open.  Things will happen in that meeting and we will not be able to undo them.  I have one last point with regard to this.  I do not think there is any way we can move without getting legal advice before next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#C02400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p><p>I was open to listening to everyone's opinion on the suggestion put forward.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, the person on whom we rely for advice, has advised us what we would be examining is how money is spent, not why it is spent.  This sets the parameters for any work that will be done in this room.  <\/p><p> This debate has spiralled in other spheres, despite the concise advice given by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not agree with Deputies Burke or Kelly that such an examination would compromise the democratic process.  I share Deputy MacSharry's point regarding the three and a half page rebuttal from the Secretary General to the Government, Mr. Fraser.  I wonder did he run that by the Attorney General, bearing in mind his challenge to this committee as to whether it has sought legal advice.  In his summary remarks he states: \"I believe your proposal appears to be unconstitutional\" but he does not reference whether he ran this three and a half page rebuttal by the Attorney General's Office to see if his own assertions were correct.  He references the Constitution.  The Constitution references the President as the person not being answerable to either Houses of the Oireachtas.  Mr. Fraser draws on Article 13.8.1&deg; in respect of the duties of the President.  It does not refer to the moneys of the office.  Mr. Fraser also talks about his own role as Accounting Officer and says that his capacity is in obtaining assurance that the office operates properly.  If his job is to obtain assurances that the office is operating properly, he obviously is required to set a standard of guidelines in respect of the spend of moneys, which are then subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and should be open to discussion and examination.  <\/p><p> As I said, I was open to the discussion this morning, as was Deputy Cullinane, but not in regard to the incumbent, President Higgins, in regard to the performance of his duties or how he conducts himself or his office.  The examination would be about how the money is spent and not why it is spent.  The letter sent to this committee by the Secretary General to the Government, Mr. Fraser, is amazing.  He has asked if the committee sought advice and if he can see it.  I do not see too much standing from him in that regard.  He has cited that it is his belief that the proposal for the meeting is unconstitutional.  We are at a stand-off.  I refute the point that an examination would in any way compromise the democratic process.  I do not believe it would.  That is a dangerous assertion.  If anything, it is about ensuring we have a democratic process, which is what anyone involved in a campaign would want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#C02500","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I did not give serious consideration to this issue until now.

I have listened carefully to the discussion and I am now moved to say we should have a discussion on this matter because I have not been convinced by the arguments against doing so.  The level of argument worries me.  I say that reluctantly.  As pointed out by Deputy Cassells, the letter from Mr. Fraser mentions that he relies on reassurances.  I have tried never to be political in this committee.  I would expect the Chairman to reprimand us if we are political because in doing so, we would lose all credibility in terms of our job.  We have done a good job, as have previous Committees of Public Accounts.  We struggle with the amount of work we have to get through.<\/p> <p>  On this matter, there are practical questions to be asked, not about any President but how money is spent.  Perhaps it should have been done before now and perhaps the committee was negligent in not having examined Chapter 1 more carefully.  If it came before us previously and we did not give it enough attention, what is the difficulty in giving it attention now?  I do not agree that that work would have to be concluded by Tuesday next.

The context for me is that it is Chapter 1 in the account which we would want to scrutinise anyway.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has given us the parameters in terms of the \"how\" and on the controls that are in place.  It would be within the scope of the accounting person to answer for the committee not why the money was spent but how it was spent.  I think we should focus on that.  I support doing it.  I agree with the concerns around the upcoming Presidential election.  I said publicly when asked about this that I have a concern in that regard.  I do not think the Committee of Public Accounts should put itself in a position whereby it could be seen that we are doing this for political reasons, that there are people outside of this committee who are lobbying us to do it because they want it as a backdrop to the election.

When the Accounting Officer is here, the committee can ask him that question.<\/p> <p>  I am of the view that we will not have any questions in respect of the President at all.  This is important and I want to put this in the public arena because it might not be fully appreciated, even though it is a matter on the public record.  There is a discussion every year at the Estimates committee on Vote 1.  I was the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on public expenditure in the previous D&aacute;il.  I attended the committee five years in a row with the Taoiseach and officials.  There is a detailed explanation presented by the Civil Service to the Oireachtas as part of that process.  I have attended that at least five times in recent times.  Deputy Burke knows full well because he attended that meeting on 29 March this year.<\/p> <p>  At that meeting this year, the Civil Service provided detailed information on expenditure on the office of the President's Establishment.  It gave specific details on administration and pay, detailed notes on underspend, detailed notes on travel and subsistence, what trips were taken, not taken, planned and have happened so far this year, detailed notes on training and development and on the centenary bounty for people who reach 100 years of age.  All of that was provided year in, year out by the Civil Service for the Oireachtas to discuss in detail.  I know from attending the committee, as does Deputy Burke, that the members are free to discuss it in detail or to glance over it.  At the meeting, the Taoiseach even made reference to the Vote for the President's Establishment because he was also dealing with the Vote for the Office of the Taoiseach at the same meeting.  It was a matter for the committee members that year and every other year how much they wanted to delve into them.  Some years they had a detailed discussion about the President's office while other years they did not.<\/p> <p>  At that meeting on 29 March this year, at which the Taoiseach gave details on this matter, he was accompanied by Mr. Martin Fraser.  If it was constitutional for that meeting to happen and for the Taoiseach and Mr. Martin Fraser to discuss expenditure on Vote 1, it is constitutional now.  To raise the issue that he thinks it is unconstitutional to discuss expenditure in respect of Vote 1 at an Oireachtas committee, it is obvious what he is suggesting about his attendance.  He has raised this issue but his actions have spoken louder than his words by his actual physical attendance at the Taoiseach's side.  He talks about the political impartiality of the Civil Service.  The Civil Service gave detailed briefings to that Oireachtas committee year in, year out.  It is on the record of the House.  I do not understand why it could now be a constitutional issue.  We have to move on.  There is no difference between one Oireachtas committee discussing Vote 1 and another discussing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#E00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>It is nearly 10 o'clock and we have not got on to CervicalCheck or any of the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#E00800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I have no issue with that aspect.

It is extraordinary that Dr. Scally is still asking questions in the report because he did not have enough information or enough time to further examine some of the issues.  There are issues about the labs and the roll-over of contracts.  Whether we have a commission of investigation or not has not yet been determined by the Oireachtas.  The committee has a responsibility to look at the areas that come under its remit.  Procurement and audit are clearly under the committee's remit, as are failures in the system and process.<\/p> <p>  The HSE and the Department are scheduled to come in next week.  That is a little premature.  The committee should do a scoping exercise as to what it now wants to do.  Is it going to do a report?  Are there going to be a number of hearings?  Who should attend the hearings?  Otherwise these people will come in next week and we will all go through the motions.  It will be aimless and there will be no end product.  It is more prudent for the committee to agree terms of reference for our work on this issue either today or next Tuesday and get that from the clerk.  That would be a better way to do justice to the issue.  There is much in the Scally report which falls under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.

The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, will make his own point.  I believe the Estimates should be cleared before the beginning of each year, not months into the year.  I will raise the issue of what is on the State balance sheet, the various semi-State bodies, the universities, the section 38 entities and companies which receive more than 50% of their funding from the public purse but may not be on the State balance sheet.  I also want to raise the issue of accounting for public private partnerships.  I will also raise the issue of what I describe as contingent liabilities, medical negligence and the accounting policies of the HSE, the biggest State organisation.  Some of these policies are set down by the Minister in legislation and do not fully comply with international accounting standards.  We exclude contingent liabilities.  I intend raising the issue of agencies such as NAMA, which are not on the State balance sheet.  I will raise these issues to have them taken into consideration.<\/p><p>The final issue is contingent assets.  There is money out there that the State does not collect.  We all hear about the money the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does not collect from people who - for example - have received a week's dole payment they should not have received.  We hear nothing at all about employers who owe money for redundancy refunds.  The State does not have a mechanism to account for that.  The Department does not have a contingent assets section to deal with the non-principal private residence charge.  If someone wants to sell a house ten years from now, the Government will be happy to take the &euro;7,000 then, but the money is due now.  There is no mechanism to know what is due.

Under section 226 of the Act, I am required to carry out periodic reviews of the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall strategic objectives.  The report on the findings of the second progress review is before the committee today and covers the period to the end of 2016.  I propose in these comments to outline the report&rsquo;s findings in just a few key areas, updating where relevant to incorporate information from the 2017 audited financial statements.<\/p> <p>  NAMA is a complex organisation, comprising a group of interrelated companies.  At group level, NAMA has returned a surplus each year since 2011, following a significant loss incurred in 2010, its first year of operation.  The strongest surpluses were returned in 2015 and 2016.  This is reflected in NAMA&rsquo;s retained earnings of &euro;3.4 billion by the end of 2017, as indicated in the figure now on screen.  As at the end of 2017, the board expected NAMA will return a surplus of between &euro;3 billion and &euro;3.5 billion to the Exchequer upon completion of its work, assuming property market conditions remain favourable while the remaining assets are worked out.<\/p> <p>  NAMA&rsquo;s primary purpose was to acquire property related loans and related collateral from distressed banks, to hold and manage those assets, and ultimately to dispose of them within the ten-year timeframe in a manner that protects the State&rsquo;s interests.  Members will recall from earlier reports that NAMA paid the banks participating in the rescue a total of &euro;31.8 billion for loans that had a par value of &euro;74.4 billion.  Because the average prices paid for the loans exceeded their assessed November 2009 market value and the property market continued to fall, NAMA subsequently recognised significant loan impairment charges.<\/p> <p>  After acquiring the loans, NAMA developed strategies for dealing with debtors on an individual so-called debtor connection basis.  Sales of loan assets commenced early on, and additional loans were provided to certain co-operating debtors to fund agreed work-out plans.  The net effect of these changes, including impairment, is reflected in the value of NAMA&rsquo;s stock of loans and receivables, which reduced from &euro;27.9 billion at the end of 2010 to &euro;3.2 billion at the end of 2017, a reduction of 89%, as indicated in the figure now on screen.  On this basis, the disposal by NAMA of its loan assets is substantially completed.<\/p> <p>  By the end of 2017, NAMA had generated proceeds of &euro;34.1 billion from the sale of loans and receivables. This comprised &euro;23.5 billion realised through the sale of underlying collateral and &euro;10.6 billion realised through loan sales.  Almost &euro;22 billion, or 64%, of the proceeds were generated in the three years 2014 to 2016, when NAMA loan sales peaked, as shown in the figure on screen now.<\/p> <p>  The 2009 Act requires NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State in carrying out its statutory functions.  How that return is to be measured is not defined in the Act.  Following examination by this committee in 2014 of the first progress report, the NAMA board set an entity return on investment, EROI, target to be achieved over its projected lifetime.  This measure was designed to relate NAMA&rsquo;s projected final surplus in 2020 to its initial investment, less an estimated &euro;5.6 billion paid to the banks in excess of the loan market values.  The board agreed in 2014 on a target EROI value of 20%.  The final surplus of &euro;3 billion projected by the board as at the end of 2016 would result in an EROI of 33%, that is 1.6 times the target.<\/p> <p>  The key shortcoming of NAMA&rsquo;s EROI as a performance measure is that it ignores the time value of money, which relates to how long it will take to receive the return.  A better, and market-standard, performance metric for property related investments is the internal rate of return, or IRR.  However, NAMA has not set targets in that regard.  Based on what NAMA paid for its loans and its projected cashflows as at the end of 2016 for each of its loans, the examination team estimated NAMA&rsquo;s projected IRR on all loans to be around 6.2%.  This is the estimated return available to cover NAMA&rsquo;s expenses, including annual interest payments on its borrowing, which were in the range 1.5% to 2.25% between 2010 and 2016, as well as its other operating costs.<\/p> <p>  A key objective set by the NAMA board was that, by the time the agency was due to be wound up in 2020, it would have generated enough cash to redeem all of the &euro;30.2 billion of senior debt issued.  The board also set intermediate targets for redemption of debt.  NAMA significantly exceeded the intermediate targets and all the senior debt was redeemed by October 2017.<\/p><p>The only debt outstanding at end 2017 was subordinated debt of &euro;1.59 billion.<\/p><p> The NAMA board adopted two secondary objectives in 2014 in respect of facilitation of the delivery of residential units and office accommodation in the Dublin docklands strategic development zone, SDZ.  NAMA initially committed to delivering 4,500 new residential units to service the Dublin market over the three years to the end of 2016.  In 2015, that initial target was replaced with a national target of 20,000 units to be delivered up to the end of 2020.  NAMA has reported that by the end of 2016, it had delivered 4,647 units nationally, including just under 3,400 in Dublin.  It was forecasting the delivery of 3,500 units in 2017 and a further 14,000 units between 2018 and 2020.  With regard to the docklands SDZ, the board approved initial strategies for the NAMA-controlled sites in 2014.  NAMA has reported that by the end of 2016, construction had commenced on projects in the SDZ comprising some 166,000 sq. m of commercial and office space and 231 residential units.  There is considerably more detail in the report which I am happy to outline further if the committee requires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy for that extensive opening statement.

The carrying value of our loan portfolio, which was &euro;7.8 billion at the end of 2015, fell to &euro;3.2 billion by the end of 2017 and further to &euro;2.7 billion by the end of June 2018.<\/p> <p>  We now project that we will deliver a terminal surplus of &euro;3.5 billion to the Exchequer assuming that we can extract full value from the residual loan portfolio and that economic and property market conditions in Ireland remain relatively benign over the next two or three years.  In addition, based on payments to date and projected payments, we estimate that NAMA's cumulative tax contribution to the Exchequer could ultimately be of the order of &euro;400 million, which would bring NAMA's overall contribution close to &euro;4 billion. This is a long way from the doomsday scenario painted by some commentators back in 2009 that NAMA could lose &euro;10 billion or more.<\/p> <p>  Much of the portfolio that is left is secured by residual assets which have been retained so that we can maximise their value, either by funding their development or by funding their progression through the planning system and thereby enhancing their ultimate disposal value.  Part of the residual portfolio is also secured by assets which are of relatively low value but which, in many cases, involve legal and other complications which will take time to resolve and which will require careful management if we are to extract maximum value.  Maximising value is an obligation imposed on us by section 10 of the National Asset Management Act, which requires us to get the best financial return for taxpayers.  At this stage, the residual portfolio is almost exclusively secured by assets located in Ireland.  As of now, the value of residual assets located in foreign jurisdictions is less than &euro;100 million.  By comparison, the loan portfolio that we originally acquired was secured by some &euro;15 billion of assets located outside of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I now turn to the progress that has been made on the achievement of NAMA's principal objectives.  This is the subject of the Comptroller and Auditor General's second progress report. The report was prepared under section 226 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, which requires the Comptroller and Auditor General, on a triennial basis, to assess the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall objectives. The first Comptroller and Auditor General progress report, which was published in 2014, concluded that, overall, taking account of NAMA's performance to date and its operating cash flow estimates for the period to 2020, it appears that unless there is a further significant economic downturn in the next few years, NAMA will generate sufficient cash to meet its minimum key objective of redeeming the senior debt.  Fortunately, there has been no significant economic downturn in the intervening four years.  This second progress report notes that the key senior debt redemption objective has been achieved and also records progress on a number of other major objectives. It is clear from the report that NAMA is well on course to achieve what it was set up to do and also to deliver a substantial surplus to the Exchequer.  It has also made a number of other valuable collateral contributions, particularly in funding the provision of much-needed commercial and residential accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The principal objective set by NAMA in its early years was to redeem the debt of almost &euro;32 billion which it issued to the participating institutions in 2010 and 2011 to acquire a large portion of their property related loans.  The senior debt of &euro;30.2 billion, which was a contingent liability - Government-guaranteed - on taxpayers, was repaid in full by October 2017.  In addition, we have now repaid a third of the &euro;1.6 billion subordinated debt and expect to redeem the rest of it by its first call date of 1 March 2020.  Earlier this year, we made an offer to holders of our subordinated debt to indicate terms at which they were prepared to sell some or all of their holdings to us.  In the intervening period, we have bought back &euro;529 million of the subordinated debt at prices which will achieve future savings for taxpayers.  We will continue to avail of any opportunities to redeem subordinated debt in advance of the March 2020 call date, but it is quite possible that some of the holders will wish to retain the debt until then.  The NAMA private investors will be paid after the subordinated debt has been redeemed.  Only then can NAMA's terminal surplus be transferred to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the redemption of the senior debt, much progress has also been made on a number of other objectives set by the board and mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's second progress report.  I will refer to two in particular, namely, the development of the Dublin docklands SDZ and the residential delivery programme.  These initiatives were launched by NAMA in 2014 and 2015, respectively.<\/p> <p>  As regards the Dublin docklands SDZ, the 15 sites in which NAMA initially had an involvement had the capacity to deliver 4.2 million sq. ft of office and other commercial space and 2,200 residential units.  The NAMA board approved its Dublin docklands strategy and business plan four years ago and, at that stage, only 1% of the delivery capacity of the docklands sites had progressed beyond the pre-planning stage.  NAMA undertook to generate activity in the docklands to bring coherence, direction and drive to its regeneration and development.  We said that we would work closely with Dublin City Council and others to bring that about and that we would provide the entire funding if that proved necessary.  Today, four years later, 61% of the 4.2 million sq. ft capacity is at the construction stage, another 18% has been completed or sold and planning permission has been achieved for the development of the remaining 21%.  We are pleased that we have been able to act as a catalyst for the development of the docklands area without putting taxpayer funds at risk.  Much of the funding for the area&rsquo;s development has come from private investors and financial institutions.  The development of the Dublin docklands has substantially improved Dublin's capacity to attract investment, including businesses which may be considering moving out of Great Britain over the coming years in response to the impact of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  One of our other major objectives is to facilitate the delivery of housing from sites controlled by our debtors and receivers.  Under EU law, we are required to operate on the same basis as private market operators.  This means that we can fund the development of residential projects only if they are commercially viable.  Otherwise, we could be deemed to be in breach of state aid rules.  Deputies may be aware that in January of this year, further to a complaint made in late 2015, the European Commission undertook an extensive review over a period of two years and concluded that NAMA's residential funding programme was not in breach of EU state aid rules.  Judging by some of the public discussion on housing, I am not sure that it is widely understood that the State has limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to funding private residential development.  If a State body is in the business of funding the delivery of private housing, it is required to operate on the same commercial basis as a market operator.  That means that under state aid rules, a State body cannot fund the development of sites that are not commercially viable to develop for private housing regardless of the scale of the supply shortfall in Ireland nor can it subsidise residential development by means of low interest rates or other special concessions that the market would not countenance.  Accordingly, the ability of any State body, including NAMA, to fund the delivery of housing is limited to those sites which are commercially viable at any particular time.<\/p> <p>  Despite the strong growth in sales prices in recent years, commercial viability is still a constraint on residential development.  Two years ago, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, estimated that the total cost of delivering a three-bedroom semi-detached house in the Dublin area was of the order of &euro;330,000, including a site cost of &euro;57,500.  In the period since the SCSI published its report, the rise in sales prices has been matched by increases in development land prices and, as a result, achieving commercial viability on many sites remains challenging.  Rising sales prices mean that affordability has become a major issue, especially in the context of the macro-prudential loan-to-income, LTI, and loan-to-value, LTV, restrictions.<\/p> <p>  Some of the recent public and media discussion on housing delivery has tended to be overly simplistic in its analysis.  There seems to be a widespread but fallacious assumption that any land with residential planning permission which is not actually being developed is thereby being hoarded.  I can only speak on behalf of NAMA but the point applies to others also.  The reality is that one cannot fund the development of a residential site if it is not commercially viable to do so.<\/p><p>Does that mean that we are supporting the hoarding of land?  We are not.  I can assure the committee that as soon as a site becomes commercially viable, there is no hesitation on NAMA's part to fund its development. <\/p><p> There are other complications to be considered also.  Each site has its own unique aspects.  Some large sites require rezoning decisions by local authorities if they are to be developed.  Others require revised planning approval if they are to become viable.  Others still cannot be developed in advance of the provision of infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage and other services.  All of these issues can be resolved over time but they require extensive and patient engagement with planning authorities and other stakeholders.  The prolonged effort that is often required to bring sites to the shovel-ready stage is not widely appreciated; it can often involve detailed preparation for two or three years in advance. <\/p><p> If there is to be a well-informed public discussion on housing supply, it needs to be recognised that not all of the sites which are zoned or have planning permission for residential development are in fact commercially viable to develop at prevailing prices.  In my view, the more pertinent issue is whether all of the sites which are commercially viable are in fact being developed and, if not, why.  Only in those cases would it be reasonable to claim that sites were being hoarded.  In respect of any sites which have viable planning permissions but are not being developed, I would fully support the use it or lose it principle. <\/p><p> There has been much talk recently of the emergence of private rented sector, PRS, opportunities.  PRS involves the commitment of capital by investors to the development of apartments which are then rented in the market thereby creating an income stream for the investors.  PRS is a relatively new asset class and, to the extent that it contributes to an expansion of residential supply, it is to be welcomed.  There is no doubt that some apartment sites would not be developed without PRS capital.  However, I would caution against the view of PRS as some kind of panacea which will make a major contribution to long-term supply.  Funds directed towards PRS seek higher returns than are currently available from money and bond market investments and, as long as bond yields are low, PRS will be an attractive asset class to those investors. It will be interesting to see, however, whether PRS will retain its appeal to investors in an environment of rising interest rates as quantitative easing tapers off. <\/p><p> We remain focused on maximising the delivery of housing from sites controlled by our debtors and receivers.  I believe that the almost 8,000 units that NAMA has directly funded since 2014 represent a significant contribution to housing supply.  Another 2,500 units have been indirectly delivered on sites that we facilitated and supported.  Our target is to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 units by the end of 2020.  We will fund much of this delivery directly but in some cases, where sites are at the shovel-ready stage, it is possible to transfer the development risk to licensees or through sales to private developers. <\/p><p> Some of our debtors have refinanced their loans and have now made the transition to bank funding or to other sources of capital.  Others will do so over the next two to three years.  In funding residential development, our primary goal is to recover as much as we can from the loans.  The ability of some debtors to refinance their loans on terms that also make commercial sense is a clear sign that the market is reverting to more normal conditions. <\/p><p> One site which has the capacity to make a major contribution to housing supply in central Dublin is the Poolbeg west strategic development zone, SDZ, in Ringsend.  This site, which is under the control of a receiver, is one of the few large development opportunities still available in Dublin.  It has the capacity to potentially provide up to 3,500 residential units and 860,000 sq. ft. of commercial development as well as school sites and community space.<\/p><p> This site provides a good illustration of the lead-in time and effort involved in bringing a major residential project to the point at which construction can actually begin.  It was designated as an SDZ by the Government in May 2016.  Dublin City Council, acting as the development agency, published the draft Poolbeg west planning scheme in January 2017.  More than 100 submissions were received from various parties and had to be considered by the council before it approved the plan in October 2017.  There was an oral hearing held by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in April 2018 and final adoption of the Poolbeg planning scheme by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is expected to occur over the coming months.  It will then be necessary to submit planning applications to the council for the development of site infrastructure such as roads and for the first phase of the project.  From the design stage to final planning approval, each phase approval process is expected to each take about 12 months.  It is unlikely that construction of the first phase of apartments will begin before 2020, some four years after the Government designated the site as an SDZ. <\/p><p> Clearly, development of this strategic site will be a massive undertaking in terms of the capital expenditure required, the significant risks involved and the envisaged seven to ten year timeframe.  The receiver is currently engaged in negotiations with Dublin City Council with a view to reaching a commercial agreement on the funding of the 900 social and affordable units - out of a total 3,500 units - which are required under the plan approved by the council.  If agreement can be reached between the receiver and the council, it will then be possible, after adoption of the scheme by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to proceed with implementation of the delivery strategy. <\/p><p> Overall, the market is responding, albeit slowly, to the shortfall in residential supply.  The Central Statistics Office estimates that almost 14,500 new dwellings were completed in 2017, an increase of 46% on the output for 2016.  Projections suggest that output in 2018 will be of the order of 18,000 units.  This is still well short of the annual requirement of 30,000 to 35,000 units but things are moving in the right direction.  Funding is now more readily available, particularly from non-bank sources, and the proposed establishment of Home building finance Ireland, HBFI, should help to expand further the supply of residential funding.  Capacity is also an issue and there is clearly a shortage of some key house-building skills.  Against that background, I believe that the gap between annual private housing supply and demand is unlikely to close for three or four years.  The more difficult issue is how the demand for social and affordable housing will be met in the near term.  Resolving this will be crucial if we are to have a more orderly market for renters and purchasers. <\/p><p> To sum up, I believe that NAMA has made major progress towards achieving its objectives.  Its principal objective - redeeming the &euro;30 billion in senior debt which was a contingent liability for taxpayers &ndash; has been achieved.  There is still a great deal of work to be done by NAMA.  Our focus now is twofold.  We have to extract as much value as possible from our residual portfolio with a view to maximising the terminal surplus that we ultimately hand back to the Exchequer; and, second, we have to fund or facilitate the delivery of as much housing as is commercially feasible from the loans attached to our debtors and receivers<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDonagh for another extensive and comprehensive opening statement.

It was certainly very important that we had overseas assets in the early days, when Ireland had gone into a troika programme.  The whole commercial and residential property and land market here had just died; there were no buyers and prices were dropping rapidly.  We used that period to look at our overseas portfolio and to generate cash.  Thankfully at the time, we caught a bit of a wave.<\/p> <p>  After the 2008-2009 crisis, most of our overseas assets were based in London, to the value of about &euro;10.5 billion.  We sold mainly from 2010 to 2016 into a rising market and we did very well with the London portfolio particularly.  We had about &euro;2 billion of assets in the US and about &euro;2.5 billion of assets in other locations in Europe.  The sale of those assets in the UK was pretty straightforward because it is the same legal system as in Ireland by and large.  Certainly the sale of assets in other overseas jurisdictions was sometimes quite difficult because we had a lot of local vagaries in law which we had to take account of.  Thankfully, we go out of the overseas market.  It was always our objective to be out of it as much as possible by the end of 2016 and we achieved that.  As of today, what we have left is only about &euro;3 million in London.  In regional UK we have about &euro;40 million and in the rest of the world including the US and continental Europe we have about another &euro;40 million.<\/p><p>It is less than &euro;100 million, as I said in my statement.  As of today, all our portfolios are effectively Irish-centric.  Some 70% of the portfolio is in Dublin.  Dublin and the contiguous counties, or what we call the commuter belt, and Cork, Limerick and Galway account for about 98% of the portfolio.  We have only about 2% in what we would call regional Ireland.

It obviously shows a huge amount of progress on our overseas property and loan portfolio.  Obviously, when an organisation such as NAMA is acquiring in excess of 12,000 loans, there will always be public commentary and debate on aspects that people deem controversial.  It was very clear from the NAMA Act, however, that assets were to be disposed of judiciously and that the aim was to try to get rid of the contingent debt.<\/p> <p>  I would like Mr. McDonagh to comment on some of the newspaper speculation and sales without getting into significant detail in each case.  I have written down details of reports on sales I have seen in newspapers.  Dock Mill, Barrow Street, sold for &euro;1.3 million and within a year it was resold for &euro;13 million.  A site on Sir John Rogerson's Quay was sold for &euro;7.5 million.  It flipped two years later for &euro;17.5 million.  New Century House in the IFSC was sold for &euro;28 million and was sold six months later for &euro;47 million.  What really got us into trouble in this country was speculation on property.  Sometimes the metric the media and others use to adjudicate on NAMA is that of speculation.  It is asked why the agency does not take advantage immediately of market values that may or may not rise in the future.  It is asked why the agency is not more commercially sensitive or sharp, for want of a better word, but this does not take cognisance of the way it was set up and its remit in legislation, and also its remit to reduce the sovereign debt.  How does Mr. McDonagh feel about this commentary?  Does he believe it is unfair when sales such as the ones I have mentioned are picked out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#M00200","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537430400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>There are a few points I would make about that.  First, the Irish market was dead.  We had to get the Irish market moving.  People invested capital in the early days before Ireland got into bailout.  We got the best price we could get for the assets at the time.  We had to generate some cash flow in Ireland and get some activity going to get some investors into the Irish market.  It always amuses me when people pick out examples and ask whether I wish I had held onto certain properties to get more money from them.  Of course I do but at the time we were trying to generate cash.  We had a troika target of paying off &euro;7.5 billion by the end of 2013.  That was non-negotiable.  I used to attend meetings every six months with the troika, with 40 people in the room, including representatives of the IMF, European Commission and the European Central Bank.  They would be shouting across the table at me asking why NAMA was not selling more and generating more cash.  They said they wanted NAMA to generate more cash and that it was too slow generating it.  That happened.  We said we would reach the target of &euro;7.5 billion, and we achieved that.<\/p> <p>  People do not comment on the other sales in respect of which we have done spectacularly well.  Nobody talks about that because it does not suit anybody to talk about that.  Let me give an example.  I am not saying this is right either but it just shows the other side, about which nobody talks.  Eighteen months ago, when we put on the market an asset that we just sold recently, people were offering us &euro;10 million for it.  We did not sell it then.  We have just completed a sale for &euro;30 million.  Therefore, we got three times the value that would have been realised 18 months ago by changing our minds and saying we would not sell at that point in time.  The buyer is the buyer.  It is a very expensive asset for him &mdash; good luck to him for buying it.  That is a big change in 18 months.

They point out that the buyers of those assets made lots of money afterwards but they must remember that at that time there was very little capital around in terms of people who were prepared to invest in Ireland.  People also forget that most of our portfolio was in Ireland and we had only sold &euro;1 billion of that portfolio by the end of 2012.  That was a very strategic decision made by the NAMA board to sell a certain amount into the market to get the market going.

Our debtors or receivers owned them.  We only held the loans.  We told our debtors and receivers that there were potential buyers of their assets in the form of local authorities.  We pointed out that there was an opportunity for them to sell unsold stock.  We also worked with the Housing Agency and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We gave them information on the properties that were available, their locations and so forth and asked if they were interested in them.  The Housing Agency then engaged with the local authorities.  Approximately 7,500 properties were offered to the local authorities and confirmed demand stands currently at 2,700.  Some local authorities were very quick off the mark.  They expressed an interest in buying units in certain locations, agreed a price and the debtors or receivers were happy to sell.  We were happy to approve sales on that basis, as long as market value was achieved.  Other local authorities, however, took a very long time to consider the matter.  As the housing crisis has worsened, some local authorities are now regretting having rejected properties offered to them between 2012 and 2015 when the housing crisis was not so acute.  Unfortunately, however, the debtors or receivers have sold them into the market at this stage.<\/p> <p>  At this point, NAMA has about 2,900 units left in its portfolio, approximately 1,400 of which are in National Asset Residential Property Services, NARPS, our special purpose vehicle, SPV, which means they have been provided for social housing.  They have been leased to approved housing bodies and local authorities.  The remaining 1,500 are effectively rented.  I looked at the figures yesterday and of that 1,500, approximately 190 are unoccupied.  I asked why 190 were unoccupied.  I found that 90 have been sold but the new owners have not yet moved in and the others are being remediated because there are fire safety issues with them.  We are spending a lot of money on remediation so that those units will become available again.  They cannot be occupied at the moment because if something happened, we would be vicariously responsible.  We cannot let people into units when we know that they do not have a fire certificate or that there are other structural issues that render them unsafe.  We have very little stock left at this stage.  Every unit that has not been sold and that can be rented and used is available.  The only additional units that will become available for social and affordable housing will become available through two mechanisms.  The first is Part V, which makes 10% of developments available so that out of every 50 units built, for example, five will go to the local authority.  The other significant mechanism is the deal that will hopefully be concluded with Dublin City Council on the Poolbeg site.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la approves the 3,500 unit scheme, 10% will be social housing, amounting to 350 units and another 15% or 550 units will be affordable housing which will be sold to Dublin City Council.  Hopefully a deal can be concluded.  That is the situation with NAMA at this point.  We offered up what we had over a number of years.  By the time some local authorities came back to us the debtors or receivers had sold the properties on or in some cases the debtor had paid off his or her par debt and had moved out of NAMA, in which case we could not offer the properties any more.  <\/p> <p>  I will refer briefly to the issue of unfinished housing estates.  There were many examples of estates of around 35 houses, with ten houses sold and occupied and 15 only half built.  NAMA was very successful in reducing the number of such estates by funding the completion of the remaining houses and making some or all of them available to approved housing bodies or local authorities for social housing.  That solved two problems - the social housing shortage and the problem of unfinished housing estates.  In 2010 there were approximately 1,500 unfinished housing estates in the country, of which 335 were in NAMA.  As of today, there are only three such estates remaining.  A lot of that is down to NAMA making funding available to complete the estates, which has been to the benefit of everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I am never one to challenge ambition but does Mr. McDonagh believe the 2017 target of 18,000 units is realistic in the context of NAMA's termination cycle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#N00800","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537430400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>We have been always been careful to say that we will fund and facilitate up to 20,000 units because we believe we can do that.

The value of those sites now is a fraction of what it will be when local area plans and infrastructure are in place.  The question is what to do with them.  Our view, which we stated at the annual report launch this year, is that it would be short-sighted to dispose of those sites now because NAMA will get better value for them after 2020.  Not only will NAMA get better value for them, that will help to ensure that they are utilised in the best way for housing.  This is a personal view and it is probably the view of the board.  Some continued involvement of the State would be beneficial.  That is the debate.  We have a clear trajectory to 2020 regarding housing and the &euro;3.5 billion in assets.

A motion tabled by my colleague, Councillor Rebecca Moynihan, was passed unanimously by Dublin City Council last night.  It called for negotiations between the council and NAMA on the sale of that site.  NAMA has its mandate but it also has access to the site along with housing, flats and sports facilities, etc.  For want of a better phrase, there are \"economies\" that make sense here.  I understand that NAMA was doing a joint venture, JV, on this that has fallen through and now that it is on the open market, given its mandate, the agency has to pursue it.  Surely there has to be a coming together in this regard whereby NAMA can fulfil its mandate and the council can use the natural economies that exist by developing that site.  Surely the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will not say that it cannot purchase this site at a commercial rate due to a lack of funding.  If that is not the case, then it is robbing Peter to pay Paul because DCC is looking for sites to develop.  This site is available with its economies and the council will end up spending money in other ways, which will not give the taxpayers as much bang for their buck because it will cost more.  This site creates huge economies.  What is the status of the site?  Are there any negotiations with DCC?  Has the JV fallen through?  Will NAMA talk to DCC based on the motion that was passed last night?

I went through them a lot in my two years as an MEP and I even helped amend them years ago in respect of the percentages allowed in different parts of the country, but there has to be some format whereby the mandate of NAMA can be fulfilled and the commerciality of it can be respected in order that the economies of Dublin City Council taking this site and developing it either in conjunction with someone or by itself can be realised.

In terms of its headline performance, there is no doubt that NAMA has been a huge success.  In terms of the Act that was provided, I say \"Well done\".  We are going to make the money.  The question is, however, as Deputy Connolly asked.  At what cost has that come?  It is a regret for me personally as a former finance spokesman in the Seanad when the Act went through in 60 hours that we did not have a NAMA No. 2 or No. 3 Bill to provide additional oversight and transparency through the process.  However, with the tools NAMA was given, we are going to make the money, which is great, but at what cost?<\/p> <p>  I was watching on the monitor earlier as I had to pop out and Deputy Kelly was speaking to the witnesses about the potential disposal of the Player site.  Mr. McDonagh made the point that it is likely, or at least possible, the debtor will have equity in the site and may well get to pay off all the debts and have some money left over, which is great.  If I was Joe Bloggs, a NAMA debtor whose assets were disposed of in 2012, I might take the justifiable view that I was unlucky.  If it had been the Player site, I might have ended up with money because a decision was taken to keep that asset while disposing of mine.  That will be a question.  As politicians, we have all had representations at our clinics over the years from people who felt they did not get optimum treatment in the NAMA process.  Those questions will always linger.  However, that is not the witnesses' fault.  Section 10 was the overarching provision and Ministers of the day had the potential to give directions.  The fact is that they did not.<\/p><p>For me that was a failing all along, in terms of some of the points Deputy Connolly made.  <\/p><p> On a personal level, I would like to put on record that, notwithstanding that it is great money will be there, we will always look back and wonder if we could have done this so much differently and so much better, in terms of a social dividend and in terms of Ministers of whatever colour or creed displaying a level of agility and an interest to adjust the process along the way that could have given as good a return in the context of the financial payback to the Exchequer when that time came, and in the context of the cost, whether to developers, to small businesses or to the social dividend, social housing being addressed to a greater extent.  The Player site debtor is in the lucky position where they may have a dividend at the end.  In the case of the person where, for whatever reasons, although perfectly legitimate at the time, a decision was made to dispose of their assets at an earlier stage, there is probably going to be debt following them to their graves.<\/p><p> Earlier Mr. McDonagh made a reference to a meeting with the ECB, which made demands on him which were resisted and its representative ran out of the room.  Fair play to Mr. McDonagh for doing that.  It is an awful shame we did not do that on the sale of loan books by the pillar banks, where the ECB was applying extraordinary pressure for all of these things to be sold off.  NAMA, the State and everybody else no longer have these problematic debts, some of which are performing.  They have been sold off to third party organisations that are not even regulated in this country.  It is a shame Governments, officials and decision-makers did not resist European pressure in that way, as Mr. McDonagh did back then, when he said he was not selling everything and that he was going to try to get the best he could.  It is a shame we did not have that level of leadership in other quarters of this State, as was outlined earlier, that he showed when it came to standing up to the ECB at that time.

The Committee of Public Accounts, being a House committee set up under Standing Order 186, does not have its agenda set by the Department of Finance or even by the Taoiseach.  I might have supported the idea of the Department deferring to the Committee of Public Accounts because it could not answer any questions previously about the liquidation because of the case taking place.

It would have ranged over the whole performance of NAMA, where we were going, the timeline, debt repayment and all of that.  Perhaps 2014 is a good example as at that stage we were evaluating in particular the pace at which we were monetising the portfolio.  At that stage things were happening in the market that gave us more confidence that we could get good value for assets and loans.  We would have had that conversation with the Minister.  I go back to the point made earlier by Deputy Connolly as no directions were given to us in that regard.  These are things we would be continuously evaluating ourselves.  I remember we had a fairly extensive strategy discussion in 2014, with various options as to where we could go.  We also had a section 227 report around that time, which was an evaluation by the Department of Finance about where NAMA was going and all of that.  From this emerged a view that we would accelerate the monetisation of the portfolio while the market was good.<\/p> <p>  Also arising from that came the housing element.  As I said earlier, NAMA was not set up to be a housing agency or anything like that and one would not find any reference in the Act to housing.  However, from 2014, we began to fund the building of houses quite extensively.

The witnesses would speak of the impact that would have on the amount returned to the Exchequer.  This is not a siloed argument, however, as there will be a cost in housing assistance payments for the real economy, for example.  There are other aspects to consider and I do not see where the social dividend lies.  There was mention of 10,000 houses from the portfolio.

If we did give them away, the Deputy would be saying we were not chasing the debtors to repay all of their loans.  What we do is if somebody has a loan and they have property, and the value of that property is set by the market and the market pays that, that is the amount that will go towards repayment of the loan.  In most instances it will not repay all of the loan but in some instances it will.  We have to operate the way that we are set up.  I have my personal views on housing.  It is very expensive.  I was looking at some statistics yesterday with one of my colleagues.  If we look at the last two years, in 2016, based on statistics from the CSO, the income ratio to buy a house in Dublin was 3.2.

There was a big hire of 4,500 people and it sucked up whatever was available in the rental market before the recovery became visible.  This was obvious in 2012 and 2013 in some places, but certainly in 2014.  It seems, however, that many of these assets were bundled and there was a kind of a rush to sell in a rising market.

It said that NAMA was a big contingent liability for the State, a huge debt was still overhanging it, the national debt was up to &euro;200 million and NAMA should move as expeditiously as possible towards extinguishing that contingent liability by selling assets.  That is what we did.  The Minister concurred with NAMA's strategy but that strategy was informed by what the Minister and the Government thought we should be doing.<\/p> <p>  There are many different people with different responsibilities.  The primary responsibility for housing sits with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Do I see that there is a big housing crisis?  I certainly do.  Do I agree with Deputy Murphy that we could see the property market beginning to recover in 2012 and 2013?  I certainly did see that as I outlined during previous committee appearances.  There is a finite point to what people can pay.  If we look at the CSO statistics, which I am happy to provide to the committee if members do not have them to hand, we can see that the Central Bank's limits for mortgages is 3.5.  We are at 3.4 in Dublin as of 2018.  If people cannot get a mortgage at more than 3.5, house prices cannot go above that because people will not get mortgages to buy them.

We funded the building, as Mr. Daly said, directly and indirectly of about 10,500 units in the last four years.  There are, however, plenty of other people in the market who have land banks.  They are beginning to build houses now but the issue is that we need more housing stock.  The whole system is choked up.  If we do not have enough housing stock, there will be people renting who would like to buy.  There is also the issue - another Deputy expressed a view on this earlier - that there should be more social housing stock available.  If there was more social housing stock, then those people would not be trying to rent against other people in the system.  This is a fundamental problem and my point is that it can only be solved by increased supply.  We are doing our best to deliver as much housing as we can but we have a limited mandate, our timeframe will probably finish at the end of 2020 and the market is the market.

They would ask NAMA if we are involved in a particular piece of land in a town or if we are not.  Sometimes everybody believes that NAMA owns all the land in the county and we would then have to say that certain land is not in our ownership at all.  If we are asked if we have any idea who owns certain land we would put the local authority right by trying to find out if we could and let them know if Mr. X or Ms X owns a piece of land.  Our policy from the start has been that if a local authority or a public body expresses an interest in any asset in NAMA we would get an independent valuation.  We would let the local authority know that the independent valuation for a site is, for example, &euro;2.6 million and ask the local authority if it wants to buy the site at that value.  If it wants to buy the site the local authority or public body must close on it within three months.  That is the type of deal we do.  We always try to accommodate that aspect.

Can we have a role in that?  They are assets under management of NAMA.  We have an obligation to get the best financial return for those.  I suppose our view is we need, as a board, to be assured that we can do that in one way or another, and there is a discussion to be had about how that can happen.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that if one goes back to what has been said today, we have demonstrated - and I have not come in here to blow our own trumpet or anything like that which I know will provoke a reaction - that we have actually been quite successful over the past eight or nine years in repaying the subordinate debt, a third of which is gone.  Particularly I suppose to the point made by Deputy Aylward, the Dublin docklands is actually a great tribute to the coherence, direction, funding and skill-set of NAMA.

If there is a role for that in future, then we would be more than willing to play it but it is not in our remit to decide that.  There is an issue with the European Commission, and I think we have to respect this.  The European Commission does not wish to see NAMA taking on any additional responsibilities or areas of work.

We all want to get out.<\/p> <p>  I want to make one observation on NAMA's overall performance and I will put it to Mr. Daly first.  I have some sympathy for his position in respect of decisions his organisation would have to make because it is somewhat subjective.  People will have opinions as to whether good or bad decisions were made.  NAMA has to make, as Mr. Daly put it in the past, real world decisions based on what the market is saying, NAMA's own goals and what is laid down for NAMA in its remit.  There would be internal pressures, external pressures, etc.  One will always have somebody with a different opinion who will say maybe NAMA should have held on, it might have got more or whatever.  I can accept that.  NAMA then has to make decisions.  At some point, it has to make a decision.<\/p> <p>  While that is the case, NAMA also must have processes to protect the organisation, the management of assets and how the agency goes about its business.  For example, the only project under which we were able to get under the bonnet was Project Eagle.  What we saw there was a deviation, maybe, from some of the sale strategies.  There were concerns, as Mr. Daly will be aware, regarding the management of conflicts of interests and a number of other matters.  The committee published a report, as Mr. Daly will be aware, on Project Eagle.  That is subject to a commission and I am not asking Mr. Daly to talk about any of that.  In terms of our report, we made a number of observations and recommendations.  Has Mr. Daly read the report?  I put the same question to Mr. McDonagh.  Have they read the Committee of Public Accounts' report?  Do they have anything to say or any comment to make on the report, given that we met several times during the course of that?  We did an awful lot of work as a committee and put an awful lot of effort into it.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that NAMA has to make decisions and there are factors and all sorts of pressures involved, but process is important to protect an organisation.  Were lessons learned from the Project Eagle sale or other sales and were lessons learned from any of the reports that were done, particularly the report of the Committee of Public Accounts?

Very definitely.  I suppose so much of the answer to what the Deputy is asking is tied up with the commission of investigation that I am sort of reluctant to go there but I absolutely agree with him that process is important.  We are an agency that has been in existence for nine years and I believe that all along the way we have learned, as any agency would.  In this committee, when we were in here regarding Project Eagle, we acknowledged that there were areas where our documentation in particular could have been improved, and certainly that has been.<\/p> <p>  I am confident in relation to the processes we have in place.  If there is anything to be learned from any transaction, project or action by NAMA over the years, we are always open to that learning and we always implement it.  I am very confident of the robustness of our processes now.  We had several discussions around Project Eagle.  I am not saying we agreed with every conclusion in the committee's report but that is something to be discussed within the Cooke commission.

I will make one follow-on point and maybe Mr. McDonagh can come in then.<\/p> <p>  One lesson I learned from it in terms of my analysis of how loan sales work and how the management of assets work is that one argument that was made consistently by NAMA is that it must work in what it calls the real world where there are market solutions and market ways of doing things.  In fact, there was criticism of some other organisations which perhaps might not have had that expertise, as was pointed out by NAMA, which I did not accept.<\/p> <p>  Something the market and those in the private sector who manage assets do is use the so-called \"internal return rate\" to set a benchmark and have a metric in order that one can measure what rate one gets back on individual assets, collective assets or loan sales, but Mr. Daly's organisation chose not do that.  This made it more difficult for us to determine whether good or bad decisions were made.  It goes back to the point I made, which is that once NAMA sold something, it could simply say that is the price it got and for all sorts of different reasons, these are the reasons the agency sold.<\/p><p>As a result of NAMA not setting an internal return rate, we, the Committee of Public Accounts, cannot say whether we can benchmark it against any objective.  It is so subjective in terms of what could have happened that NAMA is off the hook.

That basically said that we were expected to return 5% on the assets over time.  In the section 226 report, he stated that our return was 6.2%, so we have exceed the 5% target.  That is a financial measure as much as internal rate of return.<\/p> <p>  NAMA had a mixed bag of assets.  It had some really bad assets, which the banks lent on and were not worth very much.  Even if one had held them from 2010 until today, one might get less today that what one got because the land might have been dezoned and one might have had issues on the cost of holding and the remediation of the asset.

They addressed social housing supply, affordable housing, which is massively important and then taking people out of the private rented sector, if possible and reducing the price of rents.  I will benchmark that against what NAMA actually did, but before I do that, Mr. Daly mentioned that NAMA is not a housing agency.  It is correct that NAMA was not set up to be a housing agency and there is a particular skill and mindset that goes with that because it is not just about the market in terms of housing.

I do not want to rehearse the arguments about our remit and the constraints on us, if the Deputy wishes to refer to them as that.  Deputy Connolly referred this morning to the requirement in the Act which enjoins NAMA to take account of the social and economic dividend.  There are several ways in which one provides a social and economic dividend.  We would argue and we have argued before that the most effective dividend that we have delivered is to remove the &euro;31 billion contingent liability from the State and part of that dividend will be the &euro;3.5 billion that we will return in a year or two.  Part of that dividend is the 13,000 houses delivered that the Deputy mentioned; as well as the docklands.  There are all sorts of ways of delivering a social and economic dividend.

Again, there is a very specific point being made.  At the end of 2010, NAMA had over 750 debtor connections in its loan portfolio, and then so many exited.  It is all set out in the report.  The examination team from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office applied the internal rate of return methodology.  The witnesses can read this.  The approach is based on what NAMA paid for the loans and the actual cash receipts generated by the connections before exiting NAMA.  The weighted average internal rate of return and so on was approximately 3.4%.  That is what the examination found.  The final sentence is: \"NAMA's view is that it would be more appropriate to compute the internal rate of return by reference to the market value of the loans at acquisition and not what NAMA paid for them.\"  NAMA paid &euro;31.8 billion but the market value was only &euro;26.2 billion.

I believe I heard Mr. McDonagh say that when the state aid figure was being calculated, a discount rate of 15% was used.  Therefore, immediately, one has a figure of 10.3%, to which Deputy Catherine Connolly referred, as compared with the 15%.  In the previous paragraph one has the 3.4% as compared with the 5%.  This is the kind of conversation that I would envisage that we would always have at the Committee of Public Accounts about this kind of activity.  Part of the reason that the EROI was developed was that in the first report, I recommended that the internal rate of return should be used and the targets should be set.  In fairness to NAMA, it did have a conversation about it and came up with EROI and discussed it with us.

It is a very difficult question to answer without considering what return the person would receive if he or she put the money into a bank offering an interest rate of 2% or 4%.

I will move on to housing.  I am probably going to come at it slightly differently from everybody else here.  NAMA started off with one mission and that was its mission.  Then, because of the housing crisis, it was asked to build houses and supply land.  That is all very important, but it was not NAMA's main core objective or anything like that.  It was a bit of a by-product.  As I have been listening to everything here, it has struck me that there has been a lot of discussion on the housing issue, which is really only a very small part of NAMA's work.  It is an important part from a social dividend point of view.  I look at it this way.  I am looking at the global picture as NAMA's work is beginning to end.  It has said that it has done roughly 10,000 houses so far and that out of a total of 42,000 - when people are taking back and buying - it will do approximately 20,000 more between now and 2020.

Somebody touched on this earlier.  The witnesses said that NAMA was under pressure from the troika in those first couple of years to generate cash.  Some of that was from sales of property mainly outside of the country where there was a better market.  When we look to 2014 and 2015, there were about &euro;8 billion of disposals each year.  I refer to those people whom NAMA moved on and disposed of their assets or sold their loans at that time.  Have there been any complaints from them that they felt they were rushed?  The Player Wills site and some other sites were mentioned.  Some people were luckier, or perhaps were more truculent, and NAMA did not get them earlier.  They are now actually going to come out clear because they were left until last.  The guys that went early probably suffered the most, whereas the guys who, for some reason or other, are some of the last batch to be sold might actually come out a bit better.  NAMA might also do better because it might recover more.

People can make what they like of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#YY02800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537430400,"counter":1339,"content":"<p>I get the impression we are not half good enough at selling ourselves or telling the good story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#YY02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":1340,"content":"<p>Some of what I mentioned here was in the annual financial statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#YY03000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537430400,"counter":1341,"content":"<p>We are a bit shy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#YY03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1537430400,"counter":1342,"content":"<p>People can read it.  I am not charging anything for the public relations element.  The witnesses get the point and some useful information can be gleaned in there.  I have said enough at this hour of the evening.  I am here on my own and I could have asked the questions earlier but I said I would pay other members the courtesy of asking their questions first.  I thank all the witnesses from NAMA as it is quite a while since they were here.  We will receive other information as soon as they can send it.  The organisation is nearly there but not quite there yet.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, as well as the personnel from the Department of Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018092000002#YY03200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537430400,"counter":1343,"content":"<p>The witnesses withdrew.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537430400,"counter":1344,"content":"<p>The committee adjourned at 5.05 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 25 September 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
