This formula has worked well. It is based on international trade, our attractiveness as a place to invest and our ability to enter into international free trade agreements with other countries.<\/p>  <p>  CETA has provisionally applied since 21st September 2017, whereby those areas for which the EU has \"full competence\" under the Treaties are in force.<\/p>  <p>  As I set out in my appearances before the Joint Oireachtas Committees on EU Affairs and on Enterprise Trade &amp;amp; Employment, when each reviewed CETA, provisional application has seen Goods exports to Canada increase from &euro;953 million in 2016 to more than &euro;1.7 billion in 2020 - an an increase of 78% in a little over five years. And Services exports grew from &euro;1.6 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;2.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 44%. These figures demonstrate the benefits of CETA and trade agreements.<\/p>  <p>  I had originally sought to bring the relevant ratification motion for CETA before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last December. However, given the significant pressures on Oireachtas time, and to facilitate a request from the Green Party for additional time to consider the Agreement, it was agreed by Government to postpone this Motion until a later date.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the scrutiny at Committee, I do not want ratification delayed and drifting indefinitely, and for Ireland to have to stand by and watch other EU member states ratify it ahead of us, as the majority have. That would send out the wrong message to the world.<\/p>  <p>  The ratification process for CETA has also been subject to legal challenges. On foot of a case taken by Deputy Patrick Costello, the High Court has confirmed that there is no requirement for a referendum before ratification can be considered by the House.  Senator Lynn Boylan has also initiated High Court action on ratification and I hope that the Courts could facilitate an early hearing of this application as it did with Deputy Costello's challenge.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate there are strongly held differences of opinion on CETA, principally in the area of Investment Protection. Those opinions can be expressed through a democratic vote in the D&aacute;il in due course.

Applications under the Redundancy Payments Scheme from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) represent only a proportion of actual redundancies because situations whereby redundancies are paid directly by the employer from their own resources with no recourse to the SIF are not required to be advised to any Department.  In 2020 there were 4,157 redundancies paid from the SIF.  Up to the end of September 2021 there were 1,738 redundancies paid from the SIF.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the data on collective redundancy notifications sent to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment, does not reflect the total number of actual redundancies that take place across the workforce.  Collective redundancies arise when a certain number or percentage of total employees in a business are being made redundant.  Redundancies outside these parameters are not required to be notified to the Department. Also, not all proposed redundancies result in actual redundancies as alternatives can be found during the required 30-day consultation period between employers and employees.  In 2020, 12,514 potential redundancies were notified, and 6,907 potential redundancies have been notified up to the end of September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 is the Covid-19 emergency provision enacted in March 2020 which temporarily suspended an employee&rsquo;s right to claim redundancy from their employer, following certain periods of layoff and short-time work.  <\/p>  <p>  As the economy has started to gradually reopen, the emergency provision was considered no longer necessary and it expired on 30th September 2021.

It is expected that payments will become operational in the first half of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Government recognised the unique challenges posed by the Covid-19 crisis for small and micro companies.

A press release is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the review and in light of the continued labour shortages in the Agriculture and Agri-Food Sector, I decided to extend previous quotas to release 1000 general employment permits for horticulture operatives, 500 for meat deboners, 1500 for meat processing operatives and 100 for dairy farm assistants, with a strategic review of labour attraction and retention to follow.<\/p>  <p>  The pig and poultry sector sought additional quotas for Farm Operatives. The review concluded that the submission did not contain sufficient evidence to merit the removal of that occupation from the list and an associated quota of permits at this time. <\/p>  <p>  Changes to the labour market as the economy continues to reopen over the next few months will also help alleviate current shortages with an expected increase of people back into the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200059#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Centres","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200059#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[52893\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200059#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of the revision of the Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Policy; the engagement his Department has had with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications with regard to the revision of the statement; when the revised statement will be finalised and published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>The Government will shortly publish a new Climate Action Plan that will address our objective to decarbonise our economy and society. <\/p>  <p>  The Plan will be transformative in nature aiming, inter alia, to decarbonise our electricity system requiring innovative and world leading solutions on both the supply and demand sides of that market.

This highlights the importance of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help workers and businesses throughout the past 18 months, especially those wage supports which helped businesses maintain a link to their staff. <\/p><p>In its ongoing engagement with enterprise, my Department and its enterprise agencies have nevertheless been made aware of labour shortages in certain sectors. My Department has worked to signpost businesses towards the training and labour market activation programmes and supports, available through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, its agencies, and the Department of Social Protection, in order to address their staffing needs.<\/p><p>Some of these staffing shortfalls are due to pre-existing structural shifts in the economy, which have been accelerated by the impact of the pandemic. The twin decarbonisation and digital transitions, and their associated behavioural changes, are significantly altering the economy and will continue to do so in the coming years, leading to permanent changes in our labour market and business models. As we recover from the pandemic not all previous jobs will return- but embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and jobs, as well as potential skills mismatches as these opportunities emerge.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, published earlier this year, commits to supporting the transition of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and workforce to the new Green and Digital economies. It has an overarching objective of having 2.5 million at work by 2024, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. It aims to realise this goal through ongoing support for people and businesses in making a full return to work. The Plan commits to further strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s skills framework to ensure skills mismatches are minimised, and people are supported in securing and remaining in sustainable and quality employment, in areas of identified skills needs for business. <\/p><p>As the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is phased out, helping people back to work and reducing the risk of labour market scarring and entrenched long term unemployment is also a priority. This will be achieved through a combination of significant upskilling and reskilling opportunities and increased labour market activation interventions through <i>Pathways to Work 2021-2025. <\/i>A jobs led recovery will also be supported through creating the right environment for employment creation, through measures to boost the resilience, agility, competitiveness and innovation of enterprises across the economy.<i><\/i><\/p><p>This will also be supported through ensuring a balanced and inclusive recovery, through strategic investment in infrastructure and reforms that enhance our long-term capacity for growth, balanced regional development and by improving living standards. In moving towards the goal of having 2.5 million people in work by 2024, the focus will be on recovering differently, with more productive, innovative, resilient and importantly more secure and valued employment across the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200060#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200060#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[53106\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200060#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his views on whether he can deliver on his commitment made earlier in 2021 to enact paid sick leave by the end of 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to introducing a statutory sick pay scheme and work is well underway in this regard. <\/p><p>Any move to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme must be balanced with the need to support the viability of the business and enterprise sector, thereby protecting jobs.

The report is based on OECD data on foreign direct investment inflows. However, the figure referred to by the Deputy includes the movement of finances within companies and so it does not accurately reflect FDI flows which have an impact on the economy. For this reason, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s success in attracting meaningful FDI is measured by the number of greenfield investments it wins and the jobs created through those investments. <\/p>  <p>  There is positive evidence of Ireland&rsquo;s continued attractiveness as a destination for FDI, and investors&rsquo; confidence in Ireland remains strong, as evidenced by the flow of investment projects over recent months and years. In 2020, IDA Ireland won 246 investments and the number of people directly employed in the multinational sector in Ireland grew to 257,394. The pipeline of investment in the year-to-date has been extraordinarily strong considering the continued uncertainty in the global operating environment. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s mid-year results for 2021 show 142 investments won to the end of Q2, 62 of which were new name investments. These investments provide employment potential of over 12,500 jobs, close to the record levels of 2019. It is also encouraging to see that during the first half of 2021 investment continued to be spread across the country with 68 regional investments, amounting to 48% of the total investments. <\/p>  <p>  Despite these very positive results there are challenges ahead including trade protectionism, Brexit, the increasingly competitive global market for FDI and the need to keep pace with digitalisation, disruptive technology, new business models and the future of work.

My Department will continue to support IDA Ireland to partner with multinational companies to drive economic recovery and sustainable growth in the coming years. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth, launched in January this year, is an ambitious but pragmatic strategy for 2021-2024. This Strategy aims to ensure that FDI can make a significant contribution to the recovery and future growth of the economy.

The Agreement is designed to cement the close political and economic relations between the EU and Mercosur countries and represents a clear commitment from both regions to rules-based international trade.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, Ireland exported over &euro;400 million worth of goods to Mercosur and, in 2019, the most recent year for which figures on services exports are available, some &euro;700 million worth of services exports to Mercosur. An independent impact assessment commissioned by my Department and published in July this year concluded that Irish exports to the Mercosur market are expected to be 17% higher in 2035, with particular increases forecast in pharmaceuticals, computer and electronic products, electrical equipment and machinery, processed foods and beverages under the terms of the Agreement. Overall, the impact assessment projects that Ireland&rsquo;s global exports will increase by 0.24%  - or &euro;1.1 billion - in 2035 under the Agreement, supporting the attendant jobs here in Ireland in the various sectors and individual companies that should benefit from the Agreement's improved market access terms.<\/p>  <p>  However, we also have some well-known concerns regarding climate change and the environmental impact of the extensive forest fires we have seen in the Amazon Region.

To date (20\/10\/2021), my Department has issued some 12,186 employment permits since the beginning of the year, which represents a significant volume of activity. <\/p><p>Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications. <\/p><p>It is important to point out that when set against other international employment permit regimes, Ireland compares favourably, even at current processing times.  <\/p><p>However, my Department is very conscious of the recent lengthening of timeframes for processing Employment Permit applications and is committed to reducing these further.  My Department is taking a range of measures to reduce the current backlog.  It advises all employers to take current timelines into account as part of their recruitment plans.<\/p><p>My Department updates the employment permit processing timelines on its website on a weekly basis and regularly issues updates on relevant employment permit matters to Trusted Partners such as the September update on employment permit processing timelines. <table>    <tr>       <th>Critical Skills Employment Permits <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>       <th>2019 <\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>       <th>2021* <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications Received <\/td>       <td>7,117 <\/td>       <td>8,524 <\/td>       <td>8,234 <\/td>       <td>10,360 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications Issued <\/td>       <td>5,863 <\/td>       <td>7,524 <\/td>       <td>8,195 <\/td>       <td>6,707 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications Refused <\/td>       <td>442 <\/td>       <td>451 <\/td>       <td>391 <\/td>       <td>221 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Average Wait Time for CSEP (Days) <\/td>       <td>41 <\/td>       <td>30 <\/td>       <td>23 <\/td>       <td>58 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Appeals Received (All Permit types) <\/td>       <td>677 <\/td>       <td>641 <\/td>       <td>549 <\/td>       <td>326 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> *19\/10\/2021<\/p><p>Appeals received are captured collectively by all permit types at the end of each month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200062#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200062#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[52281\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200062#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of a grant awarded under the regional enterprise development fund (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>Regional enterprise development and sustainable job creation is a key policy priority of mine and the Government and is a core element of the National Development Plan.<\/p><p>My Department plays a very strong part in implementing that policy goal through a variety of policy initiatives and investments in the regions.<\/p><p>Through the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), the Border Enterprise Development Fund (BEDF) and the recent Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme (RETS), my Department through Enterprise  Ireland has approved over &euro;126m in funding for 79 regionally impactful projects for the benefit of enterprises\/industry sectors across the regions.<\/p><p>The National Design Innovation Hub DAC project was funded &euro;1,843,320 in June 2018 under the second call of the REDF for a proposal to locate a Design &amp;amp; Innovation Hub in Kilkenny, initially in a rented premises and to move to an agreed building in the Abbey Quarter (old Smithwick&rsquo;s site) when construction was complete.

The recently published Work Safely Protocol helps make sure employers and their staff have the guidance to protect against the virus and keep places of work safe.<\/p><p>The past 18 months have been difficult for most businesses, and some sectors have been more severely impacted by public health restrictions and for a more prolonged period. Throughout the pandemic my Department and its enterprise agencies have engaged with and supported businesses within their remit, and in recent months there has been the start of a recovery in employment across the economy. According to the latest Labour Force Survey, published by the Central Statistics Office, on a seasonally adjusted basis employment increased by 212,200 in the year to the second quarter of 2021, with employment standing at 2.35 million.<\/p><p>102,600 of this increase was accounted for in the second quarter of 2021 alone. This came at a time when public health restrictions had started to ease and Ireland&rsquo;s vaccination programme was being rolled out. This highlights the importance of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help workers and businesses throughout the past 18 months, especially those wage supports which helped businesses maintain a link to their staff.<\/p><p>In its ongoing engagement with enterprise, my Department and its enterprise agencies have nevertheless been made aware of labour shortages in certain sectors. My Department has worked to signpost businesses towards the training and labour market activation programmes and supports, available through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, its agencies, and the Department of Social Protection, in order to address their staffing needs. In particular, these interventions are targeting the 93,000 workers who remain on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, as of 19th October.<\/p><p>Some of these staffing shortfalls are due to pre-existing structural shifts in the economy, which have been accelerated by the impact of the pandemic. The twin decarbonisation and digital transitions, and their associated behavioural changes, are significantly altering the economy and will continue to do so in the coming years, leading to permanent changes in our labour market and business models. As we recover from the pandemic not all previous jobs will return- but embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and jobs, as well as potential skills mismatches as these opportunities emerge.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, published earlier this year, commits to supporting the transition of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and workforce to the new Green and Digital economies. It has an overarching objective of having 2.5 million at work by 2024, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. It aims to realise this goal through ongoing support for people and businesses in making a full return to work. The Plan commits to further strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s skills framework to ensure skills mismatches are minimised, and people are supported in securing and remaining in sustainable and quality employment, in areas of identified skills needs for business.<\/p><p>As the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is phased out, helping people back to work and reducing the risk of labour market scarring and entrenched long term unemployment is also a priority. This will be achieved through a combination of significant upskilling and reskilling opportunities and increased labour market activation interventions through <i>Pathways to Work 2021-2025. <\/i>A jobs led recovery will also be supported through creating the right environment for employment creation, through measures to boost the resilience, agility, competitiveness and innovation of enterprises across the economy.<\/p><p>This will also be supported through ensuring a balanced and inclusive recovery, through strategic investment in infrastructure and reforms that enhance our long-term capacity for growth, balanced regional development and by improving living standards. In moving towards the goal of having 2.5 million people in work by 2024, the focus will be on recovering differently, with more productive, innovative, resilient and importantly more secure and valued employment across the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200063#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[52830\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200063#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that job opportunities are being restored as soon as possible to pre-pandemic levels; the actions already in hand in this regard or contemplated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>The Labour Force Survey, published by the Central Statistics Office on a quarterly basis, is the official source of labour market statistics for Ireland.

To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme.\u00a0In the first six months of\u00a02021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately\u00a0&euro;17,100.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently\u00a0just over 7,000\u00a0homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. Data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)\u00a0indicates that for homes completed in the first half of\u00a02021 the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months. The\u00a0SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.\u00a0The average wait times have increased significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in place between January and mid-April when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines. This added to the\u00a0longer wait times that had already arisen due to other COVID-19 related restrictions\u00a0last year.\u00a0Wait times have also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials.<\/p>  <p>  Individual applications to the Warmer Homes Scheme are an operational matter for the SEAI and as Minister I have no role in such matters. However, in reference to the case raised by the Deputy, I have been informed by the SEAI that the home in question has been allocated to a surveyor.

The applicant can contact the SEAI call centre at 1850 927 000 for any further information.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased significantly to over &euro;109 million in 2021, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI\u00a0residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. In addition, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.\u00a0 Every effort is being made to maximise output since\u00a0construction activity in the residential sector\u00a0recommenced earlier this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200064#WRG04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200064#WRG04900"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[52148\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200064#WRG05000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he has met representatives of a company (details supplied); if so, the nature of the discussions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>I met with representatives of the company in question on 7th October to discuss general energy matters.

It also notes that 700,000 customers rely on the natural gas grid to heat and power their homes and businesses. Natural gas currently generates half the electricity we use and the National Development Plan sets out the need for circa 2,000 MW of new conventional electricity generation capacity over the course of the coming decade with much of this needed by mid-decade. This generation, most of which will be gas-fired, is needed in order to support the operation of the electricity system and provide security of supply for when variable generation, principally wind and solar, is not sufficient to meet demand.    Due to Ireland's growing reliance on imported natural gas from a single source at Moffat in Scotland, my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems.\u00a0The review is being carried out for the period to 2030 in the context of net zero emissions by 2050.\u00a0A technical analysis is currently underway which will be published later this year to help inform a public consultation.\u00a0It is\u00a0planned to complete the policy review in the first half of next year.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 27 October, almost 273,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 115,000 premises have build currently underway. The first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan. Surveys are complete or underway in County Louth in the areas around Dundalk and Ballyoran, Ballinclare, Kilcurly, Gibstown, Killincoole, Donaghmore, Channonrock, Ballykelly, Stonetown, Ednaquinn and Lannat Cross, Allardstown, Ballinfuil, Carnroe, Carrickedmond, Drumcamill, Hoarstone, Kane, Philipstown, Stephenstown, Treagh, and Whitemill. Main works have commenced in the areas around Dundalk including Ballyoran, Ballinclare, Kilcurly, Gibstown, Killincoole and Donaghmore.<\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Louth through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, NBI and my Department are also engaged in a review of potential measures that can be taken to accelerate the network rollout in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 27 October, 386 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Templetown Beach, Clogherhead, Annaghminnan Rovers GAA Club, Killanny GAA Club, Mattock Rangers GAA Club, Stephenstown Pond &amp;amp; Nature Park (located 6.3km from the premises at Braganstown) and Port Beach\/Knockbawn (located 6.3km from the premises at Salterstown).

Bus lanes are designed to make bus journeys faster and more reliable, so as to encourage people out of cars and onto public transport. This, in turn, reduces both congestion and air pollution and is considerably more environmentally sustainable than car-based transport in the long run. As the populations of our urban centres increase and public awareness of the importance of sustainable transport grows, it is likely that bus passenger numbers and, by extension, the provision of bus services and the demand for bus lanes will continue to increase year on year. As a result, it is critically important that bus lanes serve the purpose for which they were installed in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  Since bus lanes were first introduced, there have been many requests to allow other classes of traffic to use the lanes.

By year end, this will represent almost a doubling of supports to EVs in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, the EV percentage of overall car registrations has increased significantly this year and represented over 15% to end Q3 2021. Government is on track as regards the number of vehicles which need to be sold in 2021 to reach its projected annual EV target as set out in the CAP 2019. As of 30 September, there were 45,423 EVs registered in the national fleet.<\/p>  <p>  In the past year, many new BEVs with ranges of over 400km on a single charge have been introduced to the Irish market. Range anxiety is no longer an issue for electric vehicle purchasers, and while PHEVs provided an interim option, but emit both CO2 and air pollution emissions, this interim option is no longer necessary. Government supports should be provided to full electric vehicles, which will be the most effective means of reaching our carbon reduction pathway. <\/p>  <p>  I announced after the budget that grant support for PHEVs will be removed from 1 January 2022. Any PHEV which registers for the grant in accordance with the scheme rules before this date will be approved and the commitment carried forward into Q1 2022. However, from 1 January 2022 the SEAI will no longer accept grant applications in respect of PHEVs. For the top 10 PHEVS sold in 2020, four are high cost vehicles for which a grant would not be applicable and two have a direct BEV equivalent, that would be more useful in terms of decarbonizing the car fleet. Of the four remaining, three are made by manufacturers that have an equivalent size BEV model and only one model has no BEV alternative in its range. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Terms and Conditions of the grant process, drawdowns normally need to be made by year end (31 Dec). However, due to the slowdown in global car manufacturing, I am extending this drawdown date to 31 March 2021, to allow time for customers to take final possession of the vehicle. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that PHEV owners will still be able to avail of other incentives currently in place including:<\/p>  <p>  - Tolling reductions of 25% up to a threshold of &euro;500 per annum per household for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles;<\/p>  <p>  - Low rate of annual motor tax; and<\/p>  <p>  - Home charger grant of &euro;600 per household. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A national charging infrastucture strategy is being developed which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030. My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published early next year.<\/p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.  <\/p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge and is suitable for rural drivers as the majority have off street parking. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. <\/p>  <p>  Destination chargers are chargers that are installed in locations such as town centres, supermarkets, workplaces, car parks and hotels. Businesses are seeing the value of installing these for customers, visitors and employees. There is potential for this scheme to consider strategic locations which might have relevance for the more rural areas of the country and those with dispersed settlement. The final design for this scheme will also need to consider the on-going work in developing the EV Infrastructure Strategy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200068#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":546,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200068#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[52679\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200068#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department will consider the installation of bus shelters at bus stop numbers 3854 and 3855 in Lusk, County Dublin ahead of the coming winter months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":548,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

I recognise that the SPSV industry has been very badly affected by COVID-19 which brought about an almost complete collapse in passenger demand for taxi and other SPSV services. However, based on figures from the National Transport Authority (NTA), I am pleased to advise that passenger demand for SPSV services is now rising as we progress through the next and final phase of the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic:<i>COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting<\/i>. NTA figures also show a steady increase in the proportion of SPSV drivers working over the last few months: from 36% of all drivers working in January 2021 to 86% working in October 2021. I expect these trends to continue as restrictions are lifted in line with public health advice.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, since the start of the pandemic, the Government has put in place a series of both horizontal and industry-specific measures that can be availed of by SPSV drivers.  These measures are aimed at supporting the industry through this difficult period and ensuring that drivers are well positioned to take advantage of any improvement in demand as society reopens.<\/p><p>In this context, I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers have availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which, as the Deputy will be aware, has been extended to February 2022. Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given 8-week period, net of expenses. As society reopens and passenger demand for taxis increases, this continues to be a very important support for drivers as they return to work. Drivers coming off the PUP can avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Scheme, worth up to &euro;1,000 to meet the costs associated with returning to work.<\/p><p>Support for SPSV operators also continues to be available through a number of measures designed to address statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and I can confirm that they will be waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the Motor Tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website. The NTA has also extended standard age limits for taxis and hackneys several times since the start of the pandemic, and these are now waived through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.<\/p><p>Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles, the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme was increased for 2021 to &euro;15 million, up from &euro;1 million.  The amount payable under the scheme was also doubled to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. The take up rate for this scheme has been exceptionally high and the 2021 scheme recently closed to new applications following the exhaustion of this year's allocation for the scheme.  Further extensions for EV schemes have, however, been recently announced under Budget 2022.<\/p><p>Furthermore, Microfinance Ireland announced on 9 September that a loan finance up to &euro;25,000 is now available to support the eSPSV Grant Scheme, as many SPSV owners are finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers. Further information on this facility is available from Microfinance Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200069#WRM04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":611,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[53022\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200069#WRM05000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the rules that are in place to ensure card payments are available in taxis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":612,"content":"<p>The regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector, including arrangements for fares for SPSVs, is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013. <\/p><p>I have, therefore, forwarded your correspondence to the Authority for consideration and direct reply.

The process of drawing up an updated Climate Action Plan, as led by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, to reflect this increase in ambition is underway, with the new Plan to identify and set out the far reaching policy changes across every sector to deliver the necessary emissions reductions. The updated Plan is to be published shortly. The Deputy will also be aware that on 25 October the Climate Change Advisory Council proposed Ireland&rsquo;s first carbon budget programme, consistent with a 51% reduction in greenhouse gases in 2030 relative to 2018.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that delivery of this level of climate ambition will be very challenging and will require transformational change for society and the economy. This will entail additional investment, comprising of private investment and public expenditure.  Regarding the latter, the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) sets out the appropriate level of capital spending for the economy over the period to 2030. The allocation of these resources was informed by the needs identified in the development of the NDP, including climate priorities. <\/p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the current expenditure implications of the Climate Action Plan will be facilitated within the overall expenditure ceilings set out in the Summer Economic Statement and re-iterated at Budget 2022.

Stable public finances are essential in allowing us to make the significant large scale investments in climate mitigation and adaption outlined in the NDP.<\/p>  <p>  I would also highlight to the Deputy that the revenues projected to be raised by increases in the carbon tax are to be allocated for climate action purposes. The commitment to increase the carbon tax gradually over the next decade to reach &euro;100 a tonne by 2030 was given a legislative basis in the Finance Act of 2020. Placing the commitment to raise the carbon tax into legislation allows for multi-annual planning on the use of the resulting funds. For example in 2022, the revenue resulting from carbon tax receipts available for investment is &euro;412m. This is comprised of the revenue made available in 2021 (&euro;148m) and 2020 (&euro;90m) and the allocation of an additional &euro;174m as part of Budget 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO00800"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[52045\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person who has never received correspondence regarding paying their property tax faces penalties in addition to their local property tax bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>Local Property Tax (LPT) operates on a self-assessment basis and as such requires relevant residential property owners to comply with their legal requirements even where they have not received a communication from Revenue.

Secured properties remain in the ownership and control of their registered owners, or appointed receivers in the event of enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA cannot restrict the sales of properties to specific purchasers below market value, as suggested by the Deputy, as this may have the effect of breaching its statutory commercial obligations under section 10 of the NAMA Act. In addition, it is important to note that NAMA&rsquo;s debtors have the right to maximise the sales value of properties securing their loans so as to enable them to maximise their debt repayments. Therefore, NAMA cannot require a debtor to take action which would reduce his\/her repayment capacity, such as selling a property for less than market value. Notwithstanding this, I am advised that the majority of NAMA-funded newly built residential units are sold to individual purchasers, many of them first-time-buyers.<\/p>  <p>  Within the context of its overriding commercial mandate, I can advise the Deputy that NAMA has already made a significant contribution to social housing, including establishing a special vehicle (NARPS) to expedite delivery, which has leased 1,370 units to Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies. To date, NAMA has delivered over 2,640 homes for social housing. These figures exclude social housing delivered on NAMA-funded residential developments in compliance with Part V planning obligations. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA was established as an independent commercial body with a very specific legal and commercial mandate, which was approved by the European Commission in 2010. It is important that NAMA&rsquo;s role is preserved and that it completes its work in line with its original mandate; to achieve the best possible return to the State by protecting, enhancing where possible, and ultimately realising the value of assets it has acquired.  NAMA has made considerable progress toward the achievement of its objectives and a key part of NAMA's remaining mandate will be to continue to make a significant contribution to the supply of housing within the State where it is in a position to do so. Accordingly, at this late stage in NAMA&rsquo;s lifecycle, it is not my intention to amend its legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":678,"content":"<p>Question No. 245 answered with Question No. 244.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":680,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[52057\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to amend the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 to direct receivers to leave tenants in situ during sale of properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[52058\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if NAMA can provide a map and details of lands it holds by location, size, planning permission and commercial viability analysis, respectively.","asker":"1559","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[52075\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if NAMA will make available a map and the details of land that NAMA holds by location, size, planning permission and commercial viability analysis; the details of its property portfolio locations and vacant units; the details of the person or body NAMA is selling its property to and the amount; if NAMA receivers are evicting any tenants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[52441\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the persons or bodies NAMA is selling its property to; the amount they are being sold for; and if NAMA receivers are evicting tenants.","asker":"1569","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[52442\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200071#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a map and details of land that NAMA holds including location, size, planning permission and commercial viability analysis; and if he will provide a list of its property portfolio including locations and vacant units.","asker":"1569","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246, 247, 253, 265 and 266 together.<\/p><p>As the deputies may be aware, assets often referred to as &quot;NAMA land&quot; or &quot;NAMA properties&quot; are not owned by NAMA.  NAMA owns loans.  Such property is owned by private persons or companies who owe money to NAMA (&ldquo;NAMA debtors&rdquo;) and serves as collateral for those amounts owed.  <\/p><p>I am advised that Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act prohibit NAMA from disclosing confidential debtor information, including <i>inter alia<\/i>information on the specific location of  assets owned by NAMA&rsquo;s debtors, details on the purchasers of properties sold by NAMA&rsquo;s debtors and receivers, or the sales prices attained. I will therefore respond to the deputies&rsquo; questions within this context. <\/p><p>I would firstly draw the deputies&rsquo; attention to the fact that, to date, NAMA has directly facilitated the delivery of 13,000 residential units on secured sites and a further 8,900 units have been built on sites which benefitted from NAMA funding but which were subsequently sold by current and former NAMA debtors and receivers.  <\/p><p>I wish to point out that there has recently been some uninformed commentary on the amount of residential units that NAMA can and has delivered. It is important in that context to set out the factual situation regarding the restrictions under which NAMA operates. <\/p><p>- Firstly, NAMA does not own the development sites in its portfolio; rather these are owned by private entities (debtors).  NAMA cannot force them to act in a manner which may hinder or reduce their repayment capacity. <\/p><p>- Secondly, NAMA must act in a market conform way; meaning the Agency cannot provide preferential funding terms to its debtors.  <\/p><p>- Thirdly, many of the sites in NAMA&rsquo;s portfolio are simply not suitable for residential development at present owing to a lack of appropriate planning, zoning, or essential infrastructure and services (roads, water, sewerage, utilities).<\/p><p>- Fourthly, the growth in property values has allowed a number of NAMA debtors to refinance their debt and exit NAMA with their landbanks. These sites will be developed with funding from their new lenders. <\/p><p>- Finally, under NAMA&rsquo;s legislation, commercial viability is the most important and relevant criterion for NAMA-funded residential development. This basically means that NAMA can only finance developments that are expected to yield a profit &ndash; this is an important demonstration that NAMA is in compliance with EU State Aid rules. <\/p><p>On this basis, NAMA expects to directly deliver a further 2,000+ units from its secured portfolio.<\/p><p><b>Table 1<\/b>illustrates NAMA&rsquo;s delivery potential based on the viability and profile of the remaining sites with planning permission in NAMA&rsquo;s portfolio.

NAMA&rsquo;s objective is to make the sites under (d) and (e) as shovel ready as possible by achieving planning before disposal.

While NAMA does not own residential properties, it ensures that its debtors and receivers keep vacant periods in residential properties to a minimum and in instances where Local Authorities express an interest in any vacant units, NAMA facilitates the purchase of the units at market value. <\/p><p><b><\/b><\/p><p><b>Property Sales <\/b><\/p><p>NAMA&rsquo;s legislation requires the Agency to obtain the best achievable value for its assets.

I am informed that the OPW flood maps are community based and as such, they do not designate individual properties at risk. While these maps are available to the public, users are not permitted to use the flood maps for commercial purposes. As such the insurance industry has highlighted to the OPW that it does not use its flood maps to inform its flood modelling.

Accordingly, the Action Plan for Insurance Reform sets out 66 actions across a number of policy areas which is aimed at reducing volatility in the market, removing barriers to entry and making Ireland a more attractive operating environment for insurance companies. The first Action Plan Implementation Report, published in July, showed that work is progressing well, with 34 of the 66 actions completed.<\/p>  <p>A key achievement of the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda is the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.  The office has held meetings with a wide range of bodies under the four main pillars of the office work plan: Promotion, Transparency, Engagement and Innovation. These are targeted to promote greater market transparency, champion the provision of consumer information, and encourage greater competition in the insurance market, including through the application of new technologies, where appropriate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming also met with CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland earlier this year. He will meet with them again over the coming months to discuss a variety of issues, with particular emphasis on the need to address customer concerns regarding cost and availability of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Department is also working closely with IDA Ireland to target firms to enter the Irish market and explain the ongoing reforms to the insurance environment here, with the aim of increasing competition. We will continue to meet with any potential new providers to strongly make the case to enter the market or indeed expand their operations here. In addition, Department is collaborating with the Central Bank to create an insurance databank, which will assist new providers seeking to enter the Irish insurance market. This Programme for Government commitment was also recommended by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in its 2020 Public Liability Market report.  This databank is complimented by the National Claims Information Databases (NCID) reports on motor and employers' liability (EL), public liability (PL) and commercial property insurance. These initiatives will provide rich sources of industry-level and operational data to aid transparency, assist in policy formulation and also promote competition.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan, which is key to improving the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":719,"content":"<p>Question No. 260 answered with Question No. 259.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP00700"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[52282\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the arrangements in place for the public to consult the investment intermediaries register; if legacy registers exist; if so, the year they date to; if legacy registers are open to review by the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>I have been advised that the public can consult the Investment Intermediaries&rsquo; registers by viewing them on the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s website (link below). <\/p><p>There are two registers for investment intermediaries &ndash; one for those intermediaries &lsquo;deemed&rsquo; authorised by the Central Bank in July 2001, titled &ldquo;Register of Investment Business Firms deemed to be authorised as Investment Intermediary (RAIPIs) pursuant to Section 26 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995&rdquo;; and another register for those authorised by the Central Bank since July 2001, titled &ldquo;Register of Investment Business Firms authorised under Section 10 of the Investment intermediaries Act 1995&rdquo;.

Under section 819 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, an individual is considered resident in Ireland for tax purposes if they are present in Ireland for a total of: <\/p><p>- 183 days or more in a tax year; or <\/p><p>- 280 days or more in a tax year and the preceding tax year when taken together, with a minimum of 30 days in each of these years. <\/p><p>A &lsquo;day&rsquo; for Irish tax residence purposes is any full or part-day that an individual spends in the State. <\/p><p>Since 2009, certain days of presence in the State will be disregarded in practice by Revenue under what are known as &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; circumstances. This applies where an individual is prevented from leaving the State on their intended day of departure because of extraordinary natural occurrences (for example, sudden and adverse weather conditions) or an exceptional third party failure or action (for example, the breakdown of an aircraft or a labour strike), none of which could reasonably have been foreseen and avoided. In such cases, the individual will not be regarded as being present in the State for tax residence purposes for the day after the intended day of departure provided the individual is unavoidably present in the State on that day due only to &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; circumstances. This concession is granted by way of Revenue practice and it is not set out in legislation. <\/p><p>On 23 March 2020, Revenue updated the existing guidance on &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; circumstances as it pertained to the residence rules for individuals. This formed part of Revenue&rsquo;s immediate response to the severe and unprecedented situation facing individuals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the updated guidance, Revenue confirmed that where a departure from the State was prevented due to COVID-19, this will be considered a &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; circumstance for the purpose of establishing an individual's tax residence position.<\/p><p>Having regard to the unanticipated length of the pandemic, Revenue considered it appropriate to issue further guidance on the application of the concession, in particular the circumstances that Revenue may regard as falling within the scope of this concession.  This further guidance was published on 21 December 2020 and it stated that, assuming all other conditions were satisfied, any individual was considered to have his or her departure from the State prevented due to COVID-19 in the following circumstances: <\/p><p>- That individual had COVID-19 or a family member or partner with whom they are travelling with has COVID-19, <\/p><p>- That individual being quarantined or self-isolating in a particular location due to suspected COVID-19,  <\/p><p>- That individual self-isolating whether on advice from a health professional or public health guidance or self-imposed, <\/p><p>- That individual had received medical advice not to travel,  <\/p><p>- An employer requested that individual not to travel, <\/p><p>- Border controls or entry restrictions in a home country of that individual, <\/p><p>- The non-availability of commercial flights.<\/p><p>The maximum length of time in respect of the 2020 tax year that may be disregarded (which must be consecutive days) for residence purposes due to COVID-19 under &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; depended on whether the individual:<\/p> <blockquote> \t1.  Was present in the State on or prior to 23 March 2020, or <br \/><br \/>2.  Travelled to the State between 24 March 2020 and 5 May 2020.  <\/blockquote>  <p>If an individual was present in the State on or prior to 23 March 2020, then the period from the day after the original planned departure date up until 18 May 2020, or the actual departure date if earlier, may be disregarded for the purpose of determining his or her residence.<\/p><p>If an individual travelled to the State between 24 March and 5 May 2020, then the period from the day after the original planned departure date up until 18 May 2020, or the actual departure date if earlier, may be disregarded for the purposes of determining his or her residence. This is subject to a maximum of 30 days permitted, except in the case of an individual whose departure is prevented due to him or her having a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. <\/p><p>In addition, it is mandatory that the individual must have left the State as soon as he or she reasonably could and, the departure must have occurred on or by 1 June 2020.  Where a departure did not occur by 1 June 2020, then &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; will not apply to any of the days. The only exception to this is where the individual contracted COVID-19 and was not in a position to leave the State on or by this date on health grounds.  In such cases, notwithstanding the fact a departure has not occurred on or by 1 June 2020, force majeure may still apply in respect of the period to 18 May 2020. <\/p><p>Where an individual had more than one trip to the State during the period up to 5 May 2020, only days relating to the first trip may be permitted to be considered for the COVID-19 &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; concession. Any days relating to a second or subsequent trip do not qualify for relief under the concession. <\/p><p>The specific COVID-19 related &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; concession seeks to give relief to individuals who, except for the unique, exceptional and unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, would not have been considered resident in the State for tax purposes, but only in circumstances where the individual maintains his or her foreign tax residence position, for example he or she remains tax resident in his or her home country.  All individuals seeking to rely on the concession must maintain an appropriate record of the supporting facts and circumstances, should this be required for verification by Revenue.<\/p><p>Regarding the current status of the extended &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; concession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, I am advised that it only applied in accordance with the specific dates outlined above. Individuals who travelled to the State on or after 6 May 2020 will not be in a position to avail of the &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; concession as any subsequent departure will not be considered to have been prevented due to COVID-19.  As such, the concession no longer operates.<\/p><p>Further information can be found at the links below: <\/p><p>-www.revenue.ie\/en\/covid-19-information\/employer-reporting-and-filing-obligations\/temporary-concessionary-measures-2020-only\/residence-rules.aspx. <\/p><p>- Provisions Relating to Residence of Individual: www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-34\/34-00-01.pdf. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP03600"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[52742\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his future plans for the section 481 5% regional film making tax credit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>Section 481 provides relief in the form of a corporation tax credit related to the cost of production of certain films.

Once these elements have been completed, the Bill will be published and will then be considered by the Oireachtas. While no changes to the title or provisions of the Bill are currently planned, the Deputy will appreciate, the General Scheme may be subject to technical changes arising from further advice of the Attorney General.  <\/p>  <p>The Bill addresses a number of insurance-related matters that have arisen since the Action Plan for Insurance Reform   was published last December. Chief among these is the practice seen during the pandemic whereby some insurers deducted Government payments from COVID-19-related claims settlements. The Bill aims to ensure that Government is well-equipped to address this practice in future by enabling the Central Bank to collect data on such deductions through the National Claims Information Database. The Bill will also ensure that in future policyholders are fully aware of such practices, by requiring insurers to inform consumers of any State supports deducted from claims payments.

This will ensure timely oversight of any action taken in this area, such as the bank&rsquo;s proposal to ban price walking, making Ireland one of the first countries in the world to ban this practice.<\/p>  <p>Thirdly, the Bill provides for technical amendments to the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019   to clarify certain issues that arose following the initial enactment of this legislation. Finally, it amends the legislation underpinning the Temporary Run-off Regime for UK and Gibraltar-based insurers, established following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. This will rectify technical issues with the scheme that have been identified by the Central Bank. These amendments will ensure that existing legislation can operate effectively and without unintended consequences.  <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, while the length of the parliamentary process is subject to several factors, it is my hope that the Bill can be considered in a timely manner in the interests of consumers.  I believe this Bill is an important piece of legislation which will further advance the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda. I look forward to working with colleagues and stakeholders to progress it over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Asset Management Agency","counter":758,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP04500"},{"type":"question","counter":759,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[52801\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200072#WRP04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of acres owned by the National Asset Management Agency at each location in County Kildare in tabular form; if any of this land can be made available for public housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":760,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, NAMA does not own land in Kildare, rather NAMA acquired loans for which land and other properties act as security.

These changes apply in all Member States and their purpose is to facilitate cross-border online sales.<\/p>  <p>  One aspect of the changes was to remove the advantage that non-EU businesses previously enjoyed in not having to charge VAT on certain sales into the EU;  since 1 July, the EU has abolished the low value consignment VAT relief on imports valued up to &euro;22.  This means that all goods imported into any country in the EU are now subject to VAT. The current customs duty exemption for goods imported into the EU up to an intrinsic value of &euro;150 remains unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  To ease the compliance burden for businesses, the 1 July changes introduced a new scheme, the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS).  This allows businesses that are selling goods that originate from outside the EU to declare the import VAT due through a monthly return in the Member State where they have registered for the scheme.  If the business has not registered for the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS), the consumer must pay the VAT on these goods before they are released.   This scheme applies to imported goods, excluding goods subject to excise duty, where the intrinsic value of the consignment does not exceed &euro;150. <\/p>  <p>  Also, from 1 July, the distance selling thresholds of &euro;35,000 or &euro;100,000 have been lowered.  Where a business in any Member State supplies goods to a consumer in another Member State, they must now charge local VAT in the Member State to which the goods are delivered, subject to a &euro;10,000 EU-wide threshold.  Again, the new rules on intra-Community distance sales of goods are common to all EU Member States and are applied in the same way by all Member States. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to Excise Duty on cross-border sales, Revenue advise that this is payable on alcohol and tobacco products and must be paid before the goods are dispatched.  National rates of excise duty apply to alcohol and tobacco products being brought into Ireland for consumption here.  Value-Added Tax (VAT) is generally payable on excisable products.<\/p>  <p>  There is a long-standing, common EU administrative regime governing the movement of excisable products, such as alcohol, between Member States and their tax treatment on arrival in the destination Member State.  Each Member State sets its own rates of excise and, when excisable products are moved between Member States, excise is payable in the country where the product will be consumed and at the rate applicable in that country.  Responsibility for the payment of excise duty at prevailing rates on those products falls to either the seller&rsquo;s agent in the destination Member State or, if no agent has been appointed, by the person who receives the products. When ordering excise products from another Member State, purchasers should check that the seller has arranged to pay excise duty in Ireland.  Where the seller has not done so, the purchaser should contact their Revenue office to arrange payment. In the case of a duty-suspended commercial movement, the person who subsequently releases the products for consumption is responsible for payment of the excise duty.  These are, and have always been, key features of excise that are common to all Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200073#WRQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Prices","counter":779,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200073#WRQ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":780,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[53000\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200073#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures that are being considered to offset the impact of rising petrol and diesel prices in Ireland for motorists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":781,"content":"<p>The price of petrol and diesel is determined by a number of factors including taxation, the price of the raw materials, the prevailing exchange rates as well as the fact the different wholesalers can enter into forward contracts at different rates for the purchase of oil.

It sets out the categories of alcohol and alcoholic beverages that fall within scope of taxation and the basis on which excise duties on such products are to be established.  Council Directive 2020\/1151 amends Directive 92\/83\/EEC and comes into effect from next year.  Directive 2020\/1151 introduces a new provision (Article 13a) which will allow Member States the option to grant up to 50% excise relief to independent small producers of fermented beverages such as cider, subject to certain conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supported the amendments to the Directive to allow Member States introduce excise reliefs for small producers of cider.  I expect that such a relief could have a similar positive impact on the small independent cider production sector as the existing relief for small independent producers of beer has had for that sector.  Therefore, as I indicated in my Budget speech on 12 October, I plan to bring forward legislative provisions in Finance Bill 2022 to introduce such a relief.   Because the new Article 13a is structured differently to what is already permitted for small beer producers (under Article 4), the existing relief in Irish legislation for beer could not be simply extended to cider.  It will be necessary to provide a separate new relief, which would be similar in concept but different in detail. While this measure will be broadly modelled on the existing relief arrangements for beer, further considerations will need to be given to ensure clarity in relation to scope of the relief and also to its design and implementation so as to minimise the administrative burden and any compliance risks. My Department is considering these matters further and will engage with the sector and with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to the measure being introduced in next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200073#WRQ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":800,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200073#WRQ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":801,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[53165\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200073#WRQ03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of credit unions that have applied for and been approved to invest in social housing provision by the Central Bank in each of the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":802,"content":"<p>On 18 September 2021 it was announced that two credit union backed funds had received regulatory approval from the Central Bank to lend to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the purposes of delivering social and affordable housing.

However, the Deputy will be aware that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover in such circumstances.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department consulted with Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, for further information on this matter.  Insurance Ireland noted that while some insurers do provide cover in the case of stillborn children under life cover policies, this remains a decision for individual insurers and the approach to this is not standard across the industry.  In this regard, they noted that some insurers may cover childrens lives from birth; or for certain specified conditions from birth; or from a specified age, for example three months. Given this difference in approach by insurers, I believe it is important that individuals taking out life insurance products familiarise themselves with the terms and conditions of a policy prior to purchasing it, and to shop around in accordance with their needs.  <\/p>  <p>  Where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider with regard to the above, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).

The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it may interest the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.

These maps are available to the public at www.floodinfo.ie however, it is important to note that the Flood Maps are community based and that they are not designed to designate individual properties at risk.

The OPW has a role to assist insurance companies to take into account the protection provided by completed flood defence schemes. In this regard, the OPW has a Memorandum of Understanding with Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry. This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on these completed schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding. Insurance Ireland members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these protected areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Disclaimer and Conditions for Use of OPW Flood Maps on www.floodinfo.ie includes a provision that users of the website must not use the Flood Maps, or any other content of the website for commercial purposes.  As such, the Disclaimer prevents insurance companies from using the flood maps generated by the OPW.  The insurance industry has its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk that it is willing to underwrite in relation to individual properties.

At its meeting of 19th of October Government agreed that the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector could reopen from October 22nd with the full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the COVID-19 pass.   This  represents an important next step towards the full reopening of our economy and our society, and is a crucial opportunity for returning to work for the live entertainment and events sector. Government's aim has been to allow as many businesses as possible reopen in the safest possible way, and importantly - stay open. <\/p>  <p>  With the gradual lifting of restrictions over recent months, the number of customers receiving PUP has dropped significantly.

The Arts Council was provided with a historic level of funding for 2021 of &euro;130m which has been retained for 2022 to continue to support artists as the sector recovers.  I have allocated &euro;25m for the live entertainment sector in 2022 and I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure that available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible. <\/p>  <p>  Other priorities for Budget 2022 was to secure &euro;25m in funding for a pilot Basic Income Guarantee Scheme for artists and arts workers and to secure funding to support the full recovery of the arts\/culture and live entertainment sectors in 2022. The pilot scheme was the number one recommendation of 10 recommendations made in the Life Worth Living report, published in November 2020 by the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce. I am currently reviewing the interim report of the Oversight Group to determine which model will be most appropriate for the pilot scheme.  Once that has been established it will be possible to provide further information on the specifics of the scheme.  It is anticipated that up to 2,000 participants will be able to avail of the pilot scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  COVID-19 infection rates are once again increasing along with hospitalisation and ICU admissions. While the exceptional levels of engagement with the Vaccination Programme allowed us to continue our careful and gradual approach to re-opening we must all redouble our efforts to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.  I know the night-time economy sector which includes so many businesses have been patient and have looked forward to full and un-restricted reopening, and the Government's most recent decision on re-opening has allowed many working in the entertainment and cultural sector to return to work.  We must continue to exercise caution as we move forward, with the ultimate goal of a full, unrestricted and safe re-opening of all aspects of society, including arts and entertainment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200075#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies","counter":884,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200075#WRS01700"},{"type":"question","counter":885,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[52304\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200075#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 301 of 13 July 2021, if Sport Ireland has commenced the recruitment process for its new CEO (details supplied); if not, the reason; when it will commence; if the Public Appointments Service will have a role in the recruitment of the new CEO; if the position of the incumbent CEO will be extended for a further period as has become the practice using Covid-19 and other reasons as cover; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1606","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":886,"content":"<p>The recruitment process for the position of Sport Ireland CEO has commenced.

However, it is, of course, within the discretion of individual local authorities to provide support from within their own resources to local communities who wish to erect and maintain memorials, where this is deemed the appropriate approach.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that local authorities will receive a number of requests from commemorative committees and community groups seeking support for the erection of monuments and other memorials as we navigate through the sensitive forthcoming period of commemorations.  <\/p>  <p>  While we recognise that these incidents and actions are undoubtedly of great local significance in the narrative of the part played by individual counties during the Struggle for Independence and Civil War, this is just one element within the Community Strand of the overall Decade of Centenaries Programme.  There is scope for a rich diversity of interesting and engaging commemorative initiatives to be curated from within the annual funding allocation from my Department to each of the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200075#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200075#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[52959\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200075#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding streams that are currently available and open for amateur boxing clubs; the funding provided to amateur boxing clubs in counties Meath and Louth in each of the years 2017 to 2020 and to date in 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.

I and my officials have been engaging with the various sectors involved in the Night-Time Economy to address some of the challenges faced throughout the past 20 months, in the run up to the Government Decision and also following the Government Decision.  It is important that Government engages with the sector and I was in a position to provide a support package of over &euro;60m for the industry while restrictions were in place. In addition to engagement with the sector, there has been intensive engagement for the last 20 months between officials of relevant Departments on all aspects of the pandemic as it relates to the sectors under the aegis of my Department and beyond. Relevant Departments include Roinn an Taoisigh, the Departments of Health, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. I also engage proactively with Government colleagues on all Government decisions relating to the management of the pandemic response. <\/p><p>As we are still in the middle of a pandemic, and in light of the epidemiological situation which has emerged over the last number of weeks,  it is imperative that we carefully manage reopening, and there will inevitably be nuances and differences in how we do things.  Government's aim has been to allow as many businesses as possible reopen in the safest possible way.  This is why we need certain regulations in place and also robust guidance to assist businesses to reopen safely and importantly &ndash; stay open. <\/p><p>Regulations were published on 28 October 2023,<i>Health Act 1947 (Sections 31AB and 31AD) (Covid-19) (Operation of certain indoor premises) (Amendment) (No. 6) Regulations 2021<\/i>and the <i>Health Act 1947 (Sections 31AB and 31AD) (Covid-19) (Operation of certain indoor premises) (Amendment) (No. 7) Regulations 2021<\/i>which give effect to the electronic ticketing requirements for nightclubs and live entertainment venues and these took effect from Friday 29 October.  <\/p><p>There are a number of criteria applying to venues which must implement a ticketing system and dancing or standing to view a performance is included in these criteria.  This is to distinguish traditional pubs and restaurants from music venues and nightclubs &ndash; most of which have been closed for the past 20 months or operating under restrictions.  No definition of dancing has been included in the legislation.<\/p><p>The new Regulations provide for orderly, managed and socially distant queues for the return to bar service.  These elements of the reopening plan are required by law and will be subject to compliance checks by relevant authorities and subsequent penalties for non-compliance.  <\/p><p>The Government's decision in relation to the safe re-opening of society was predicated on appropriate safeguards being put in place to reduce risks, and the subsequent guidance and regulations relating to the safe re-opening of events and venues was developed in this context, having regard to the epidemiological situation and in close consultation with relevant Government colleagues. This guidance is available at www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/updated-guidelines-for-nightlife-and-live-entertainment-sector\/ and it contains a range of advice including on ventilation, hygiene, management structures, face coverings etc. While I understand that the ticketing requirement for live entertainment venues and nightclubs has been challenging for some businesses, our aim at all times has been to ensure a safe re-opening and that business can remain open.  While ticketing had initially been considered as recommended only and this was relayed to stakeholders, due to increasing concerns about the public health situation, it was decided in consultation with relevant Government Departments, to make this condition mandatory to ensure robust contract tracing and to ensure that businesses optimally manage capacity levels in their venues.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment informed industry groups last week of developments and listened to their concerns.  Many operators already have robust ticketing systems in place and others have already developed solutions to this issue.Operators who foresee a delay in putting the required ticketing system in place can remain trading as they were &ndash; that is operating as a pub or caf&eacute;, without the additional dancing\/live entertainment offering, until they have their ticketing system in place.  <\/p><p>We know that countries across the world are working through the challenges of reopening society while the pandemic continues.  These countries are all different and the way they develop their reopening plans will be different to ours.  We have to try and balance a welcome reopening of businesses with the protection of public health.In making decisions, Government is always conscious of following public health advice, framed against a rapidly evolving public health context, and it was based on this advice that a decision was made to reopen the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector but only with the full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the COVID-19 pass.<\/p><p>COVID-19 infection rates are once again increasing along with hospitalisation and ICU admissions. However, thanks to the exceptional levels of engagement with the Vaccination Programme, we are in a position to continue our careful and gradual approach to re-opening.  However, we must all redouble our efforts to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.  I know the night-time economy sector which includes so many businesses have been patient and are looking forward to full reopening, but we need to be prudent so that we can continue to move forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200075#WRS06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":931,"content":"<p>Question No. 331 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":932,"content":"<p>Question No. 332 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":933,"content":"<p>Question No. 333 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":934,"content":"<p>Question No. 334 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":935,"content":"<p>Question No. 335 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":936,"content":"<p>Question No. 336 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":937,"content":"<p>Question No. 337 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200076#WRT00900"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[53323\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200076#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of the review of the Large Scale Sports Infrastructure Fund; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1488","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":940,"content":"<p>The Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects, including swimming pools, with at least &euro;100m being made available over the period to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and, thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.

Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), the Minister is precluded from exercising power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is, or may be, concerned.\r\n\r\nConsideration of flood risk is embedded into the planning system through the issuing of Section 28 Guidelines for planning authorities entitled The Planning System and Flood Risk Management(further updated by Circular PL2\/2014). The guidelines introduce comprehensive mechanisms for the incorporation of flood risk identification, assessment and management into the planning process (namely the preparation of statutory land-use plans and at planning application stage) at national, regional, local authority and site-specific levels. These guidelines require the planning system to:\r\n\r\n- Avoid development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly floodplains, unless there are proven wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the flood risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level without increasing flood risk elsewhere;\r\n\r\n- Adopt a sequential approach to flood risk management when assessing the location for new development based on avoidance, reduction and mitigation of flood risk; and\r\n\r\n- Incorporate flood risk assessment into the process of making decisions on planning applications and planning appeals.\r\n\r\nHowever, because of climate change, the impact of extreme rainfall events is becoming more frequent. In turn, this can significantly increase both the level of pollution from urban runoff and the risk of flooding.  \r\n\r\nIn preparing Ireland for these challenges, my Department is continuing to develop and review appropriate adaption measures. Among the actions identified in the second-cycle River Basin Management Plan was the delivery of guidelines for planning authorities on the relationship between physical planning and river basin management planning.\r\n\r\nThe development of these &ldquo;Guidelines for the Incorporation of the Water Framework Directive into the Planning System&rdquo; is intended to assist planning authorities in meeting their legal obligations under the Water Framework Directive.  One key objective of these guidelines is the promotion of sustainable rainwater management solutions and the strategic use of nature-based solutions at catchment scale. The guidance will provide advice on how to integrate best practice measures at forward planning and planning permissions to avoid, reduce and \/ or remedy negative impacts to water quality and where possible, to enhance water quality through well-designed measures with multiple benefits not only for water quality, but biodiversity, climate and flood risk.\r\n\r\nIn line with a proposed action in the recently published draft third-cycle River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, my department will seek to progress any amendments to the planning and development legislation that is required to give effect to this new guidance. In the meantime, a public consultation on the draft guidelines will be undertaken to provide stakeholders with the opportunity to comment prior to finalisation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, my Department is also finalising an interim guidance document, &ldquo;Nature-based Solutions to the Management of Rainwater and Surface Water Runoff in Urban Areas&rdquo; which will be published shortly and will be a step towards addressing flood risk in a natural way.\r\n\r\nThis interim guidance document is for urban planners and designers and shows how to move towards a more systematic and sustainable approach to urban planning through Water Sensitive Urban Design. This is to be achieved through the replacement of impermeable surfacing with nature-based planted areas that are designed to absorb, retain, store and treat urban runoff prior to discharge back to the environment. This will reduce pollution and flood risk as well as improving biodiversity. There is an urgent need to address this issue by the retention of rainwater as close as possible within the catchment to where it occurs, and the management of any surface water flows within an urban area.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":947,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200076#WRT01195"},{"type":"question","counter":948,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[52042\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200076#WRT01196","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the action he will take regarding necessary repairs at a location (details supplied).","asker":"1488","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":949,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 222 of 7 October 2021 which sets out the position in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200076#WRT01198","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":950,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200076#WRT01200"},{"type":"question","counter":951,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[52069\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200076#WRT01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the way the framework for local authority submissions for the 2022-2024 Multi Annual Rural Water Programme is being developed; the total funding made available by his Department; when applications will be accepted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":952,"content":"<p>My Department, under the oversight of the Rural Water Working Group, is reviewing the Framework for the upcoming Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2022-2024. <\/p>  <p>  The organisations that are participating on the Working Group reflect the importance and wide ranging impact of the Rural Water Sector.

Fire services place a huge emphasis on safety of their staff and are they trained to operate as teams, to evaluate each emergency situation and plan interventions in accordance with Standard Operational Guidance, to undertake appropriate risk assessments. Working under the direction of the Incident Commander, their focus is  to ensure the safety and welfare of the public they serve, as well as their colleagues and themselves.

The twenty-year award is a medal bearing the traditional logo representation of the fire service - a helmet and crossed axes.  The thirty-year award is a flame emblem.  The forty-year award is a bar; both the emblem and bar attach onto the medal ribbon.  <\/p>  <p>  The first national awards presentation was organised in 1998 and is now held every two years at a national presentation ceremony. The latest of these ceremonies was held in November 2018, at which 288 fire service personnel were eligible for awards. Unfortunately, due to COVID, ongoing efforts to prevent the spread of infection and the need to protect the health of firefighters, these national ceremonies will be replaced by small local presentations until it is safe for us to gather in large groups again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200077#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[52668\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200077#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to issues regarding recruitment and retention within the retained fire service; his plans to carry out a review of the retained fire service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1064,"qnumday":380,"qnumall":"[52669\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200077#WRU02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of fire fighters in each fire authority in addition to the full establishment figures.","asker":"1625","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1065,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[52670\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200077#WRU02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of fire fighters for each fire station in County Wicklow in addition to the full establishment figures.","asker":"1625","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1066,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 379, 380 and 381 together.<\/p><p>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. Fire services issues are managed in my Department by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM).<\/p><p>Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide, with 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters.<\/p><p>The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for the fire authority, based on its assessment of risk, needs and resources. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act 2001, it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority.<\/p><p>In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms\/ standards being established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, ' Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.<\/p><p>The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates. <\/p><p>Local Authority fire services in Ireland are staffed by over three thousand professional, competent and highly committed personnel in the full-time and retained fire services. Local authorities, as the funders and the employers of fire service personnel, have demonstrated their commitment to their fire services over the past number of years. The number of frontline fire service staff have been maintained at a consistent high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were of necessity reduced in other areas of the local authorities.  <\/p><p>In relation to issues regarding recruitment and retention within the retained fire service; the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has approved a proposal for undertaking a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;retained&rsquo; fire services delivery, with particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff. The objective is to explore and understand the issues which are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future.<\/p><p>While my Department does not routinely collect the data in the format requested by the Deputy, a breakdown of the number of firefighters in each fire service as of October 2021, based on data supplied by local authorities, is set out in the table below.

Exchequer funding provided by my Department is governed by a protocol agreement between the Department and the lead authority in each region.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.

This digitisation, carried out in accordance with the guidelines set out in the PRA Digitisation Protocol Document, involved moving away from an increasingly deteriorating paper map system to providing access to accurate and consistent digital mapping, thereby resulting in a more dynamic and flexible organisation that was better placed to fulfil its strategic business objectives.  Prior to its commencement, the PRA Digital Mapping Project was validated by eminent International mapping\/land administration experts and shown to be fit for purpose. <\/p>  <p>  The registration mapping framework maintained by the PRA has been underpinned by its link to Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) topographical data since the establishment of the Land Registry in 1892. The OSi base map did not, in any way, contribute to digitisation issues. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Digital Mapping Project was much more than just a matter of transferring the registered land parcels from a paper map record to a digital map record. Some of the factors that contributed to the complexity of the challenges associated with the project were: <\/p>  <p>  - moving all registrations from the now defunct County Series and Irish Grid map projections to the latest Irish Transverse Mercator map projection; <\/p>  <p>  - that development schemes mapped on the PRA paper-based record were found to be at variance with the more accurate 'as built' layout presented by OSi;  <\/p>  <p>  - the transferring registrations, from Western seaboard counties, which were, up until the Digital Mapping Project, predominantly mapped on 1\/10560 or 6&rdquo; OSi mapping, had not benefited from any revisions for decades; <\/p>  <p>  - deciphering map data on old Land Registry paper maps, some of which were 100 years old; and <\/p>  <p>  - deciphering map data on badly damaged Land Registry paper maps.<\/p>  <p>  The Digitisation Protocol was written by the PRA and underwent a robust governance process, extensive engagement with key stakeholders and customers and supported by OSi.

As detailed in Housing for All under &lsquo;Pathway to Supporting Home Ownership and Increasing Affordability&rsquo;, affordable purchase and the home loan scheme will be primarily targeted at first time buyers.  However, the plan also confirms that it is intended that a &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle will apply for applications to these schemes. Depending on the particular scheme, this could mean that people who have been involved in a relationship breakdown or who have undergone insolvency proceedings, will be eligible to apply. <\/p>  <p>  Housing for All commits to delivering an average of 4,000 affordable purchase homes per annum.  Regarding the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, I have already commenced Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 regarding Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements. Section 10 of that Act details criteria for the assessment of applicant eligibility by a housing authority and provides eligibility in cases where a marriage, civil partnership or relationship has ended.  It is intended the Regulations governing the operation of these provisions will be put in place in the near future.  It is intended that upon deployment of the measure the Fresh Start principle would also apply to the new First Home Shared Equity Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Cost Rental affordable homes, the first set of Regulations under the Affordable Housing Act 2021 came into effect on 19 August, and these govern the process by which the owners of dwellings may obtain the designation of their properties as Cost Rental dwellings.

It is vital that perpetrators be held to account. Ireland has consistently called for the withdrawal of Eritrean forces whose presence has been linked to numerous reported atrocities. In this regard, Ireland strongly supports the investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC).

Emergency passport services were maintained during the pandemic, which required staff to be on site to process and issue passports. On that basis, and taking account of the COVID protocols in place at the time, 67,000 passport books and cards were issued between January and May of this year.<\/p><p>Since May of this year, almost 450,000 passports and passport cards have been issued, meaning that, in total, over half a million passports and cards have been issued to date in 2021. Almost 45% of passports for simple online adult renewals issue within one business day.<\/p><p>The current Passport processing times, provided all required documentation is provided and in order, are:<\/p><p>10 working days for Simple Adult renewals,<\/p><p>15 working days for Complex renewals,<\/p><p>40 working days for First Time applications on Passport Online and<\/p><p>8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service.<\/p><p>The projected passport issue date provided to applicants on the online Passport Tracker provides an indication only of the estimated issue date based on current averages. This projected issue date is not an intended guarantee of service. Applications can take longer than the average turnaround time if applicants have not provided all of the required documentation to complete their application. There are currently over 115,000 online applications on hand at the Passport Service. Of these, over 50,000, or 44% of applications, require the applicant to submit the documents needed to complete their passport application. The Passport Service engages with all applicants who have not submitted the required documentation to ensure that their application is completed correctly and can proceed through the processing system. Of the 65,000 applications that the Passport Service is processing, approximately 4,500 (7%) are past the estimated issue-by date. The Passport Service prioritises applications that are past their estimated issue-by date. <\/p><p>The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants, particularly in light of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Passport Service and the high demand for passports seen in recent months as international travel resumed. In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  Budget 2022 included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p><p>Adequate staffing of the Passport Service to respond to demand remains a priority for my Department and is an issue that is kept under constant review. The Department has assigned 126 officers to the Passport Service to date in 2021. In addition, 50 officers were internally reassigned to the Passport Service during the period of peak demand in the summer.  The Department is currently focused on recruiting additional staffing to meet expected demand for passports in 2022 and ensuring adequate staffing levels in the Passport Service. <\/p><p>In line with the continued scaling up of services, the Passport Office in Mount Street, Dublin 2 and the Passport Office in Cork are now offering an Urgent Appointment Service for the renewal of passports. This service is available to people who require passport renewal at short notice and opt for this fee-based service to do so. To avail of this service and book an appointment, members of the public can visit the Department&rsquo;s website (www.dfa.ie\/passports). The Urgent Appointment Service ensures that, for those who unexpectedly require a very urgent turnaround of a passport renewal, an option is available that is transparent, predictable and clear.  It means that an applicant can book and pay for their appointment, safe in the knowledge that they will have their passport within a day, or a few days. <\/p><p>I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply for a passport in plenty of time in order to avoid unnecessary stress. The Passport Online service continues to be the fastest and most efficient channel for passport applications and is available to first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. <\/p><p>The specific figures requested by Deputy Calleary are outlined below.<\/p><p><b>Passport applications on hand<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Date <\/th>       <th>Applications on hand <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>22 September 2021 <\/td>       <td>133,779 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>22 October 2021 <\/td>       <td>130,353 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>Passport Books and Cards issued by week<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Week commencing <\/th>       <th>Passport books and cards issued <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>30 August 2021 <\/td>       <td>15,774<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>6 September 2021 <\/td>       <td>18,118 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>13 September 2021 <\/td>       <td>18,274 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>20 September 2021 <\/td>       <td>18,574 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>27 September 2021 <\/td>       <td>16,986<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>4 October 2021 <\/td>       <td>17,764<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>11 October 2021 <\/td>       <td>17,757<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>18 October 2021 <\/td>       <td>14,373<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200079#WRW01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1183,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200079#WRW01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1184,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[52396\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200079#WRW01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will make arrangements with the Singapore government for a vaccinated travel lane (details supplied).","asker":"1597","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1185,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to doing everything possible to support and facilitate the resumption of safe international air travel, and especially to ensure that Irish citizens living abroad are able to return home to Ireland for visits and to reunite with friends and family here.

Freedom of speech and freedom of expression, often encapsulated in the form of film and art, are key to democratic pluralism and an essential component of every democratic society.<\/p>  <p>  I raised my concerns about the situation in Hong Kong with my Chinese counterpart,  State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during my visit to China in May this year. Ireland continues to voice these issues both bilaterally and in multilateral settings, particularly through UN structures. Through our Consulate General in Hong Kong and our Embassy in Beijing, we continue to monitor and assess the situation closely, and will continue to raise our concerns in dialogue with China.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200081#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1279,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200081#WRY01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1280,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[53293\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200081#WRY01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if documents will be returned urgently to persons (details supplied) in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1281,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has been in direct contact with the applicant's parent and is facilitating the return of documents as requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200081#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1283,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[53324\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200081#WRY02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to an ongoing problem with the Passport Office online photo download application; and the steps being taken to fix this problem.","asker":"1468","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1284,"content":"<p>The Passport Online service offers a user-friendly, efficient and secure system through which citizens can apply for a passport.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA). <\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. It is important to note also that under the Special Education Teacher allocation model, a NEPS assessment is not required for students to access learning supports.<\/p>  <p>  Every school, including the 37 schools which are the focus of this question, have access to NEPS for critical incident support, for regional support and development and also to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries, through the local NEPS office.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to a casework service, schools that are temporarily without an assigned psychologist have access to casework via psychologists on the SCPA panel, where there is need.  SCPA psychologists are invited to renew their membership every year. The recent increase in fee in March 2021 for psychological assessments completed under the SCPA scheme has realised additional SCPA psychologists available nationally, including in the North East region.  In addition, this increase in fee has realised an increased willingness by SCPA psychologists to engage in this work.  <\/p>  <p>  Where vacancies arise, NEPS seeks to recruit psychologists to fill these vacant posts.  Following completion of a recent recruitment competition by the Public Appointments Service, vacant posts in NEPS are now being filled. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200083#WRAA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1397,"content":"<p>Question No. 496 answered with Question No. 495.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":1398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200083#WRAA03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1399,"qnumday":497,"qnumall":"[52356\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200083#WRAA03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the results of a survey (details supplied) of 37 schools in the north-east Leinster area regarding the collective total number of days since the start of the 2021-2022 academic year that schools were unable to get a substitute teacher to cover a mainstream class teacher; the collective total number of days they were unable to get a substitute teacher to cover for an absent special education teacher, unable to find a substitute teacher and a mainstream class was taught by a special education teacher and the collective total number of days that an unqualified substitute teacher taught a class to cover for an absent teacher; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1400,"content":"<p>My Department recently received the survey referred to by the Deputy and is considering its findings.<\/p><p>A range of measures have been put in place to provide enhanced substitute cover in the context of Covid-19.

Key considerations for my Department in this matter is our policy of inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  However, while my Department primarily supports mainstream schools, it does provide funding for a small number of schools  and centres which provide education for the small number of young people below the age of 16 who do not complete mainstream education. These out-of-school services are typically a provision of education, outside of the mainstream school setting, for children who have disengaged or encountered difficulties in mainstream education. This provision is an alternative option when all other supports, options and pathways have been tried and have not proved successful in maintaining the student&rsquo;s engagement with mainstream education. <\/p>  <p>  These settings vary in structure and design but provide an important service for a small cohort of students who have become disengaged from mainstream education. Examples of such are the Youth Encounter Project Schools and some alternative education settings. My Department has undertaken a review of education provision in the out-of-school sector. The recommendations of this review will inform future policy in this area. <\/p>  <p>  For those learners who leave school at the age of 16 or above, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science fund a range of services. Youthreach provides a programme of second-chance education and training designed for early school leavers. The aim of the programme is to help young people in the 16 - 21 year old age group to make the transition from school to work through the provision of co-ordinated foundation training, education and work experience. The programme includes a considerable amount of personal development and exploration, where participants&rsquo; needs, interests and capacities are fully taken into account and has a  strong emphasis on the core skills of literacy\/numeracy, communications and IT, along with a choice of vocational options and a work experience programme. There are almost 6,000 places available under Youthreach each year,  the majority of these places are operated locally by 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in 110 centres. Places are also provided through 32 Community Training Centres, and look after the training and employment needs of early school leavers, primarily aged between 16 and 21. <\/p>  <p>  Also, apprenticeships provide a structured training programme and allow early school leavers to gain the skills and knowledge to succeed. There are currently 62 apprenticeships available leading to qualifications from levels 5 to 10 on the National Qualifications Framework. The basic entry requirement for apprenticeship is a junior cycle qualification.  For those school leavers who do not meet basic educational requirements, there are a range of options available through pre-apprenticeship courses or recognition of prior experience which may provide alternate entry routes to an apprenticeship.   Pre-apprenticeships are programmes targeted at young people aged 16-24, where the aim is progression to an apprenticeship.  In addition, the Technological University Dublin Access to Apprenticeship programme is a 12 week programme which aims to support individuals aged 16-24 who have experienced particularly severe social or economic barriers to access craft apprenticeship roles.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out a five year plan which will make apprenticeship visible and available for all learners.  The Plan addresses the clear need to broaden the awareness of apprenticeship as a work-based route to internationally recognised qualifications and experience for people of all ages, be they progressing in their career, school leavers, career changers or the unemployed. Under the Plan the impacts and outcomes will be examined to provide an evidence base for best practice and future interventions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200084#WRBB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200084#WRBB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1464,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[52588\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200084#WRBB04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of portacabins per school in County Wicklow over the past five years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1465,"content":"<p>Temporary accommodation in schools is comprised of both rented and purchased prefabricated units.

The recent public service agreements allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to commence which has led to many improvements since the measures implemented following the financial crisis. For example, the starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702 but as a result of the programmes of pay restoration, it is now &euro;38,192.  <\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government has supported the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.  However, the Government must also bear in mind the costs of such measures in the context of overall expenditure. The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance) and these costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.  <\/p>  <p>  However, measures have been put in place in relation to new entrant pay. In September 2018, an agreement, which provided for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants, was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU which benefitted 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The current national agreement, Building Momentum, which provides for two general round increases in basic salary and in allowances to be implemented in October 2021 and October 2022 for all public servants also contains a specific provision in relation to new entrant teacher pay which allows for the skipping of Point 12 of the pay scale which is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers. This measure will resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers. The agreement also includes a provision for a sectoral bargaining fund to be used by unions to resolve outstanding priority claims or to provide for a further 1% general pay increase and this process is underway at present.<\/p>  <p>  These measures show the benefits that continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions can bring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200086#WRFF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1524,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200086#WRFF01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1525,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[52803\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200086#WRFF01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of ASD spaces there are at primary and post-primary level in an area (details supplied) for the academic year 2021-2022.","asker":"1525","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1526,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government. <\/p><p>The level of investment in special education, at almost &euro;2 billion, is at an all-time high.<\/p><p>An additional 269 special classes have been opened this school-year.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. It is important to note also that under the Special Education Teacher allocation model, a NEPS assessment is not required for students to access learning supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200087#WRGG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1580,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200087#WRGG02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1581,"qnumday":558,"qnumall":"[53208\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200087#WRGG02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the progress for a permanent site for a school (details supplied).","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1582,"content":"<p>I can confirm that officials from my Department have identified a number of potential site options for the permanent location of the school referred to by the Deputy.

A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory).  The actuarial value of the State Pension is estimated at over &euro;300,000 which requires people who claim a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the 50 year term of a working life.  It is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it. <\/p>  <p>  The State pension system provides significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role.<\/p>  <p>  This is provided through the award of credits and\/or the application of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (under the Yearly Average method for payment calculation) and\/or the application of HomeCaring Periods (under the Aggregated Contribution Method (also known as the interim Total Contributions Approach).  <\/p>  <p>  Details of these are &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  -  Credits &ndash; PRSI Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.

The Scheme, which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to be disregarded (from 1994), can  have the effect of increasing the Yearly Average.<\/p>  <p>  -  HomeCaring Periods &ndash; This Scheme makes it easier for a home carer to qualify for a higher rate of  State Pension (Contributory).  HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Aggregated Contribution Method (also known as the Interim Total  Contributions Approach) of pension calculation.  HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution (regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  Since April 2019, all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and the interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.  The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s\/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if his\/her spouse is a State pensioner and has significant household means, his\/her most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on his\/her personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension. <\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission has now concluded its work and has submitted its final report to me.

While referrals to active CE vacancies continued throughout the pandemic, where such referrals could be made in compliance with public health guidelines in place at that time,  I am pleased that referrals of long term unemployed persons to CE schemes are now be getting back to more normal levels, across the country. <\/p>  <p>   Both I and my Department are very aware of the need to continue to support CE schemes during the current recovery period.  To continue to support CE schemes  and ensure that important community services continued to be delivered,  CE participants whose contracts were due to come to an end since October 2020 have had their contacts extended on a number of occasions.  The latest extension will continue up until February 2022 and a coordinated and phased exit schedule will commence thereafter which will allow further time to fill vacancies arising.  This approach,  coupled with the increased rate of referrals to fill existing vacancies will mean that no CE scheme should be in danger of closing for the reasons cited by the Deputy.  I should mention that time spent in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) will count towards eligibility for CE and other employment support programmes. <\/p>  <p>  One of the measures included in the Pathways to Work Strategy announced by Government in July, 2021 was an increase in the capacity of the Public Employment Service in Intreo Offices and contracted services to further support jobseekers through the provision of job search advice and assistance.  This increased capacity will support persons whose jobs are permanently lost due to COVID-19 as well as those unemployed pre-pandemic.  These additional resources will also support the increased demand for new candidate referrals, from amongst unemployed persons, to fill existing and new CE vacancies.  CE projects are encouraged to remain in close contact with the Department's Community Development Officers in order to ensure referrals are made in a timely manner to fill vacancies. Long term unemployed persons who are engaging with Intreo contracted employment services such as Jobpath also continue to be eligible for CE and can take up CE places, once they satisfy eligibility requirements. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, building on the July Jobs Stimulus,  and as part of the Pathways to Work Strategy, the Government is providing 3,000 additional places on Community Employment and T&uacute;s.

This is the case even if only one of the couple is actually claiming a payment.  This is not exclusive to Disability Allowance and applies to all of the Department's social assistance schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of assessing household, rather than individual  income, is to ensure that resources are targeted at households which need them most.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the household means limit for a Disability Allowance claimant with a spouse or cohabiting partner is higher than for a single claimant.

To date expenditure on the scheme is almost &euro;8.86 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The number of customers supported by PUP has fallen each week from a peak of over 600,000 in 2020 to just over 90,600 last week as more employments and businesses are able reopen due to the gradual lifting of restrictions and successful roll-out of the vaccine programme.  On 22 October Government approved the easing of further restrictions, but with caution, given the concerning number of Covid-19 cases.  As we continue to gradually reopen the economy it is important in the interest of fairness and sustainability to restore standard Jobseeker payments in a controlled and considered manner.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, the rate of PUP is changing using a tapered approach from September 2021 until February 2022 to align it with standard jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  Further rate changes will take place from 16th November 2021 and 8th February 2022.  As PUP customers move on to the &euro;203 rate, they will be transitioned to standard jobseeker terms. <\/p>  <p>  Having listened to sectors including those working in the performing arts sector, I deferred the commencement of the transition process which was due to start at the beginning of September until after all sectors were able to start to reopen after 22 October. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has written to customers currently receiving the &euro;203 rate of payment to advise that they will continue to receive PUP until 9th November and will then have the option of qualifying for a Jobseeker payment if they are eligible.

Recipients receive a payment of &euro;128.60 per week and there is no income limit applied. <\/p>  <p>  Alternatively, a self- employed person who is trading at a reduced level may be eligible for support under the means tested Jobseeker's Allowance Scheme subject to satisfying the statutory scheme conditions.  The scheme for self-employed artists under Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance is open to professionals from a wide range of artistic disciplines.  The artists on the scheme are exempt from participating in the normal labour market activation activities for a period of 12 months, but all other scheme conditions apply.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the &euro;1,000 Covid-19 Enterprise Support Grant to assist self-employed people to restart their business will continue to be available to self-employed people closing their PUP claims until the end of 2021.  A self-employed person closing their PUP claim to reopen their business will be able to avail of this grant even if they have previously claimed it as part of an earlier reopening of their business in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Arts and Culture Taskforce made a recommendation in October 2020 to introduce a pilot basic income scheme for artists.

This means that any such person with a PRSI record of 2,080 qualifying contributions or more at the time of award is entitled to the maximum rate of SPC.<\/p><p>For SPC recipients who were awarded SPC prior to 1 September 2012, pension rates were calculated using the Yearly Average approach only. Due to the nature of the calculation, certain people&rsquo;s pensions will be below the maximum rate of SPC, despite a record of 2,080 contributions.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s records show that at least 1,818 people with a record of 2,080 contributions or more who retired prior to 1 September 2012 are in receipt of a pension below the maximum rate of SPC. However, detailed social insurance records are not readily available for some 14,000 pensioners who retired prior to 2006 and who are currently in receipt of a pension below the maximum rate. If these pensioners&rsquo; social insurance records are similar to those of people who retired between 2006 and 2012, then the overall number of people in this category would be significantly higher.<\/p><p>More broadly, there are over 100,000 people in receipt of SPC at below the maximum rate who retired prior to 1 September 2012. Any retrospective application of the interim Total Contributions Approach would have to be extended to this whole cohort, so that my Department would have to review the pension rate for each pensioner, as well as for Qualified Adult Allowance and other pension claims where there is an underlying entitlement to SPC. <\/p><p>Retrospectively reviewing the SPC entitlements of the 94,000 people who retired on or after 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 2012 and whose original SPC rate was below the maximum resulted in an average pension rate increase of &euro;7.90 per week.<\/p><p>If the average uplift for SPC recipients who retired before 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 2012 is similar, this would imply additional annual expenditure of &euro;46.5 million.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Actuary estimates that the full cost of implementing such a policy change, including back-dating of increases to the date of retirement and increased payments in the future, would be over &euro;1 billion.

With effect from 4th January the maximum personal rates will increase to &euro;208 and proportionate increases will apply to the qualifying adult and child rates.<\/p>  <p>  Over the course of these changes, the Department will offer PUP recipients supports to assist them to return to employment at the earliest opportunity. These may include individualised meetings through the local Intreo centre where support will be provided with Jobsearching or referral to further education or training. The recently launched Pathways to Work Strategy also provides a range of targeted employment and training supports. These include the provision of 50,000 further education and training places, 10,000 apprenticeships and the new Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) for customers who have been unemployed for more than 6 months. Participants on WPEP are paid &euro;306 per week and increases are paid for qualified adults and children.<\/p>  <p>  Additional targeted income supports are provided by my Department for individuals who are experiencing financial difficulties, under the means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. These include Rent Supplement, Fuel Allowance and Urgent and Exceptional Needs payments where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  Although Fuel Allowance is not payable to those in receipt of PUP, time spent on PUP may count towards qualification periods for customers receiving a qualifying payment, for example Jobseeker's Allowance.  Fuel Allowance is payable to qualifying customers who have been getting Jobseeker's Allowance for more than 390 days. If a customer has come directly from PUP to Jobseeker's Allowance, then the PUP duration for both 2020 and 2021 can be considered for the purposes of Fuel Allowance eligibility. As part of Budget 2022 a &euro;5 increase was applied to the basic weekly rate of fuel allowance bringing the weekly rate of Fuel Allowance to &euro;33 with effect from payments made on 1st November. <\/p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, also continues to provide assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or in receipt of social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears. <\/p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position for the Deputy at this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200090#WRKK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":1743,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200090#WRKK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1744,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[53114\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200090#WRKK01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be examined; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1745,"content":"<p>The decision in the case of the debt on the Jobseeker's Allowance claim of the person concerned has been reviewed by an authorised Officer of the Department on receipt of your correspondence.

These measures are designed to deliver quality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers, and support employers to improve pay and conditions for staff. They include fee control measures in respect of a Transition Fund and a new core funding stream. <\/p>  <p>  The allocation for early learning and childcare next year is &euro;716 million, an increase of &euro;78m from &euro;638m in 2021. This excludes supports provided under the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).<\/p>  <p>  The new core funding stream will become available from September 2022 and is worth up to &euro;69 million to providers in 2022, equivalent to &euro;207.3 million for a full year.  <\/p>  <p>  This funding stream marks the start of a multi-annual investment plan and is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. The new corefunding stream introduces a strategic new way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model. <\/p>  <p>  Under the core funding stream,  providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures. The funding will support the quality of ELC and SAC services by better enabling providers to attract and retain qualified staff, including degree-qualified staff; establish career structures; and introduce or improve other features of provision that are demonstrated to contribute to quality (e.g. non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation). The new funding stream will also ensure that services can remain sustainable and will contribute to cost increases related to non-staff costs (for example, utilities, rent).<\/p>  <p>  A key basis for participation in the core funding stream will be a commitment not to increase fees to parents in return for the increased State funding. This commitment not to increase fees will be central to the new core funding contract, reflecting the substantial additional investment that is being made available. Ireland is following in the steps of many other jurisdictions with the move to increase certainty for parents and for the State in respect of fees, combined with improved stability and sustainability for providers and staff, and a commitment not to increase fees is a part of this. <\/p>  <p>  Further detail on other conditions, including quality requirements, will be available following the publication of the report of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model, due later this year.  There will also be an extensive programme of communications with the sector in advance of the launch of the new core funding stream.<\/p>  <p>  Prior the introduction of the new core funding stream, access to the EWSS, including exemption from the turnover rule, will continue for ELC and SAC employers until April 2022. The value of this exemption to the sector is estimated at &euro;116 from November 2021 - April 2022.

In the most recent published Sector Profile (published in 2021, and relating to data from 2020), 44% of services reported challenges in recruiting suitably qualified staff over the past 12 months. While this figure was down 9% from the previous year, it remains high.

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy.<\/p><p>As the State does not employ ELC and SAC practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.<\/p><p>I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and working conditions. That is why last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC\/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.<\/p><p>On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector.<\/p><p>In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, which Minister English accepted.

The Scheme is designed to acknowledge that childcare needs differ widely across different families, and this is why subsidies are offered on an hourly basis. <\/p><p>However, parents and providers continue to agree on the amount of childcare that is needed and can be provided. The NCS pays subsidies based on the hours of care agreed between the provider and the parent, up to the maximum hours awarded to the parent. Providers are not required to change their policies or operations.<\/p><p>I am aware of the challenges faced by providers in changing to a new scheme and a new IT system.<\/p><p>The NCS Chick registration is the same for all awards.

The postgraduate awards range between 1-4 years in duration with the annual award value comprising a stipend of 18,500, a contribution to fees of &euro;5,750 and research expenses\/consumables funding of &euro;3,250. The Irish Research Council received 1,194 eligible applications to the scheme under the 2021 call. <\/p><p>Applications are open to researchers from anywhere in the world. Successful applicants are hosted by an eligible higher education or research-performing institution in Ireland under the guidance of an academic supervisor or mentor. All applications to the scheme are subjected to international independent peer review under a two-stage process in which each application is reviewed up to four times by different academic experts. The Government of Ireland awards are a key component of the pipeline of early-career researchers in the Irish research system and promote the balanced development of the system across disciplines.<\/p><p>Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship applicants fall into one of two categories: European applicants (Category One) and international applicants (Category Two). Since its establishment in 2012, the IRC has operated a procedure whereby a majority of awards are made to category one applicants. The approach is made clear in the call document for the scheme.<\/p><p>In April 2021, after offers were issued, the IRC Executive uncovered a misclassification of applicant categories on the AHSS (Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences) on the assessment outcome ranking list, meaning that a small number of applicants were categorised as &lsquo;Category one&rsquo; that were in fact &lsquo;Category two&rsquo;. In making offers according to the ranked order of merit, offers were made to Category two applicants which should have been made to Category one applicants. When the IRC corrected the categorisation and reviewed the master ranked list again it became clear that a number of applicants that should have received offers according to the order of merit did not receive offers. Taking account of declinations that are part of the normal offers process, this outstanding number was 5 applicants. <\/p><p>The Irish Research Council operates under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority and following discovery of the error, the IRC Executive reported the matter to the CEO of the HEA, who is the Chief Accounting Officer of the Irish Research Council. The error was reported to the Authority&rsquo;s Finance and Governance Committee and, subsequently, the Board of the HEA. The Irish Research Council, having given full consideration of options to address the error, made a recommendation to the HEA Board that it make the 5 additional awards to ensure that the ranked order of merit is maintained. The additional cost is &euro;468,000 over 5 years. The recommendation was made on the basis that no additional budget was being sought by the IRC to implement it with the additional cost being absorbed through adjustments to other IRC programmes.<\/p><p>The IRC Director wrote to my department in advance of the relevant HEA Board meeting advising of the error and the process that was being followed to address the matter within the governance structures of the Authority. In response, my officials noted the issue; the recommendation of the Council to address the problem; the understanding that no additional funding was being sought by the IRC for the additional awards; and that the proposal to address the matter was to be put for decision to the HEA Board.<\/p><p>This IRC is taking a number of steps to ensure that this error does not reoccur. The categorisation of applicants has now been automated within the IRC&rsquo;s Smart Simple application system, removing the scope for human error in this part of the process. The IRC intends to further enhance automation at all stages of the application, awards and post-award processes, drawing on a recent external review of the system by Mazars. This work will be supported by a new Systems Manager post within the IRC. Further development will take place having regard to and consistent with broader systems and business process development within the Higher Education Authority. The IRC recently commissioned a process review of the Government of Ireland Postgraduate and Postdoctoral schemes, and the Executive is currently considering the recommendations of the review in advance of processing of applications for the 2022 call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200092#WRMM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":1860,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200092#WRMM02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1861,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[52004\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200092#WRMM02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount of funding allocated to Ireland under the Erasmus+ programme for student and staff mobility for the 2019-2020, 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 academic year;

The group is open to staff members from HEIs with academic or professional expertise in this area as well as representatives from the Higher Education Authority. <\/p><p>In May 2020, the Intersectionality Working Group produced a statement <\/p><p>(hea.ie\/assets\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Intersectionality-WG-Statement-on-Ethnicity-Categories-in-Irish-HE.pdf ) to provide staff in HEIs with information on the rationale for collecting ethnicity data and the complexities of categorisation. The statement also provides some context for race equality work in higher education, as well as recommended actions for HEIs to consider. The statement has been endorsed by 25 HEIs, as well as by the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association.<\/p><p>In late 2020\/early 2021, the HEA conducted a national survey of HEI staff to develop a picture of race equality across the Irish higher education sector. For the purposes of the survey, race equality was defined as &lsquo;equal representation, equal experiences and equal outcomes of staff from minority ethnic groups&rsquo;. The survey was developed by the HEA Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, in collaboration with the Athena SWAN Ireland Intersectionality Working Group. The recently published HEA report, <i>Race Equality in Higher Education<\/i>, presents the findings of this survey.<\/p><p>This report is extremely important as it gives us, for the first time, data in relation to the experience of staff from minority ethnic groups in Irish higher education. It highlights that higher education institutions have an opportunity to play a critical role in relation to racial inequalities in wider society. There is an opportunity for higher education to become a beacon of good practice in this area. This report is the first of its kind in this area and will help HEIs to keep pace with wider demographic changes in Irish society. <\/p><p>The recommendations, many of which are already being implemented by HEIs through their ongoing work in advancing equality, diversity and inclusion, will now be considered by the HEA and the Intersectionality Working Group. This group will advise on a plan for the implementation of key recommendations, which is expected to be finalised in the new year. This is a new area of work for the higher education sector and any implementation plan will focus on short, medium and long-term goals to ensure that our HEIs offer an equality of opportunity for all students and staff, regardless of ethnicity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200093#WRNN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":1900,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200093#WRNN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1901,"qnumday":666,"qnumall":"[52235\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200093#WRNN01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if students from Northern Ireland will be able to avail of the Erasmus programme in the 2021-2022 academic year and the next academic year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1902,"content":"<p>My officials will be meeting very shortly with institutions, North and South to finalise proposals to enable the temporary registration of NI higher education students with Irish higher education institutions, which will facilitate their Erasmus mobilities.

Curricula are updated on an ongoing basis to keep pace with changes in industry practices and regulations. In recent years new construction apprenticeship programmes have been developed in areas such as Geo-drilling (Level 6) and Scaffolding (Level 5). The Wind Turbine Maintenance Apprenticeship currently in development will include best practice in green technology. Five craft programmes are due for full revalidation (including a full review of the curriculum) during 2021; Electrical, Plumbing, Heavy Vehicle Mechanics, Metal Fabrication and Carpentry &amp;amp; Joinery.

Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books\/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum and supports circa 14,000 students.  This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. <\/p><p>An additional &euro;1 million was added to the fund in 2018 for students attending Professional Masters of Education (PME) courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This additional funding was also made available for the 2019\/20 year and again in 2020\/21.  The additional funding provided to students on PME programmes helped to alleviate some of the costs associated with undertaking a PME course. Students on PME courses face particular costs unique to their studies e.g. accommodation and travel costs associated with Gaeltacht placement, school placement costs and course materials. <\/p><p>Effective for the 2021 Student Grant Scheme I announced enhanced postgraduate supports which saw  the fee grant amount rising from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants will also rise, up from &euro;31,500, now &euro;54,240. The increase in fee grant will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and will give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition to the increase in the fee grant, the income thresholds for postgraduate students were increased from a postgraduate threshold of &euro;31,500 to &euro;54,240 in 2021; which is currently the highest income threshold at undergraduate level.

Under the terms of the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. The aim of the student grant scheme is to make a contribution to the cost of going to college. It assists over 70,000 students annually to access third level education.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the Student Grant Scheme is at an advanced stage, and is in the process of finalisation by the consultations and the steering group.  There was significant public interest in the Review, with around 280 submissions and over 9,000 survey responses from students.  The final Report will be presented to me later this year and I intend bringing it to Government for approval.  It is the intention that this review will inform policy priorities and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I have secured an additional &euro;15m to enhance the existing financial supports under the Student Grant Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  For the academic year 2022\/23 this will mean:-<\/p>  <p>  - An increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant. There are currently circa 62,000 SUSI grant recipients receiving maintenance support. <\/p>  <p>  - The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant has been increased by &euro;1,000. <\/p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022\/23 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  I have prioritised these changes for the 2022\/23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students building on the improvements that have already been made for postgraduate students through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme. These improvements to the student grant scheme have been a priority for me since taking up my Ministerial appointment.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in higher education institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum currently supports circa 14,000 students.   This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the package of COVID supports provided by Government again this year, &euro;10 million was allocated to an Access Funding package of which &euro;8.1 million was allocated to the Student Assistance Fund. &euro;1.9m has been allocated to COVID19 Contingency Fund for Access Services. The total funding available in 2021 under the Student Assistance Fund is &euro;17.2m.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each HEI who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. The 2020 allocation to the fund is &euro;9.6m which is expected to support circa 14,000 students. <\/p>  <p>  The FSD aims to support the personal, educational and professional development of the participating student and contribute to the achievement of their full potential. Eligible students can receive assistance from the FSD from further education level 5 up to doctoral level 10, and it can be applied for during any year of study. The FSD operates as a funding allocation to approved higher education institutions and PLC colleges. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each institute who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. Funding can be used to provide supports and accommodations for assistive technology, equipment and software, non-medical helpers, academic or learning support, deaf supports and transport. <\/p>  <p>  A significant development with this Fund has been the inclusion of students on part-time courses in 2018 and this continued into 2019 and 2020 also. <\/p>  <p>  The transfer of the FE allocation of the Fund for Students with Disabilities from the Higher Education Authority to SOLAS was completed in July 2020. With effect from the 2020\/21 academic year, SOLAS has assumed responsibility for the management of the FSD for the further education and training sector, including issuing of the guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  There are three strands to the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) with an overall funding envelope of &euro;42m. <\/p>  <p>  - Strand 1 supports access to initial teacher education from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan. <\/p>  <p>  - Strand 2 provides bursaries to students who have been identified by their higher education institution as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access      Plan. <\/p>  <p>  - Strand 3 supports regional clusters of higher education institutions with the aim of attracting additional students from groups currently under-represented in higher education. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of PATH 2 for the 2021\/22 academic year, three tiers of bursaries will be available for awarding to the most socio economically disadvantaged students from National Access Plan Target groups across six clusters. Tier 1 is &euro;5,000 per annum for the duration of studies awarded to a total of 203 students across the six clusters ; Tier 2 - &euro;2,000 per annum for the duration of studies to a total of 120 students across the six clusters who met the criteria for the 1916 Bursary but who did not ultimately qualify for a Tier 1 bursary; Tier 3 &ndash; Once-off bursary of &euro;1,500 payable for the 2021\/22 academic year only to students who met the criteria for the 1916 Bursary but who did not ultimately qualify for a Tier 1 or Tier 2 bursary. The provision of this once-off bursary is in recognition of the exceptional circumstances that incoming students will experience when starting college in 2021\/22 and the impact of Covid-19 on family incomes of students from target groups.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;5m funding to support new pilot initiatives under the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund to address priority actions that will be identified in the new Strategic Action Plan for Equity and Inclusion in Higher Education 2022-2026 currently under development. Colleagues in my Department are working closely with the HEA on the development of the new Plan with the intention of publishing the plan in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is provided to seven disadvantaged initiatives to support access to higher education. Six of these initiatives are community based projects located in areas of disadvantage and one is in respect of an access initiative in Trinity College. All of the projects target children and young people who are generally at risk of under achieving and not reaching their full academic potential. They also seek to direct further targeted activities at children and young people who demonstrate high academic potential but may be at risk of not progressing to further or higher education for a variety of reasons. <\/p>  <p>  Ring-fenced funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund of &euro;300,000 is available for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 for Traveller transfer to and progression within higher education. The funding will help ensure expected increases in Traveller participation in higher education remain on track. <\/p>  <p>  FET provision is largely free or heavily subsidised. The only fees are PLC fees which are a nominal &euro;200 per student (not including those entitled to a medical card or SUSI grant). About 40% of students pay the fee. Fees are collected at the start of the academic year. However, as provided for in Budget 2022, the &euro;200 fee will no longer apply from the start of the 22\/23 academic year. <\/p>  <p>  Apprentices are paid an allowance equivalent to their on-the-job wages for periods spent in education and training institutions. In addition, unemployed participants on relevant training courses are paid a training allowance by ETBs based on their DSP payment.  In the case of training for unemployed people, these allowances are integral parts of the programmes, as (i) they facilitate the participation of individuals who would not otherwise be in a position to take up training and (ii) they ensure that only individuals who are active participants in the training are in receipt of the allowances. Your local Intreo Office can advise if you are entitled to any allowances whilst on a training course.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, accommodation, meal and travel allowances are paid to learners to assist them with the cost of actual attendance on some courses.<\/p>  <p>  A Mitigating Against Educational Disadvantage Fund (MAEDF) worth &euro;8 million was allocated in Budget 2021 to the FET sector for 2020. The MAEDF was managed by SOLAS in 2020 and provided funds to support educationally disadvantaged learners in accessing and participating in FET. It also enabled investment in building the digital infrastructure of FET providers and their capability to ensure that online learning can be delivered in a way that meets the complex needs of all FET learners, and that these learners have the skills that will allow them to effectively participate. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the great successes of the MAEDF, and in recognition of the continuing challenges in relation to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions a further &euro;10 million is being allocated to the MAEDF for this year. SOLAS issued two calls for proposals, the closing date for Round 1 applications was 24 September 2021, and closing date for Round 2 applications was 31 October 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200093#WRNN05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1943,"qnumday":680,"qnumall":"[52483\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200094#WROO00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 671 of 19 October 2021, if a student in receipt of a 50% maintenance grant will receive a &euro;200 increase in their payment per year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1944,"content":"<p>The Student Grant Scheme, administered by SUSI, provides grant assistance to students pursuing an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.

","asker":"1627","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1966,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 687 and 688 together.<\/p>  <p>Education and training relevant to skills needs in the construction sector is delivered across the full remit of Further and Higher Education (through apprenticeship; non-apprenticeship further education and training (FET) and Higher Education (HE)) and through main stream education and training as well as through specific programmes such as Springboard, the Human Capital Initiative and Skillnet Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Under Budget 2022, I have allocated over &euro;122 Million to support the development of skills across all sectors of the economy. A large proportion of that funding has gone towards the development and promotion of apprenticeships and ensure that the targets are met for the Action Plan for Apprenticeship <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the development and promotion of apprenticeship is a significant Government priority in responding to key skill needs across the economy. These requirements are identified through work carried out to project workforce and skill needs in key economic sectors. In particular, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) plays a crucial role in analysing future skill needs in areas such as construction to meet housing and climate action targets. <\/p>  <p>  A key objective of the Government's Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 is to ensure that the apprenticeship system is equipped to meet these skills and human capital requirements as well as those arising from the accelerating pace of green and digital transformation. The Plan is intended to drive the future development of apprenticeship to increase its attractiveness to employers in meeting their workforce requirements. <\/p>  <p>  In considering the important role played by apprenticeship in responding to these needs, it should be noted that apprenticeship is an employer-led offering. The number of apprentices in any specific sector is, therefore, determined directly by employer demand. The Plan is thus designed to deliver a flexible and responsive apprenticeship system which is attractive and easy to engage with for employers and potential apprentices, and which delivers high standards and sought-after qualifications. &euro;34 million has been allocated to support and develop apprenticeship including &euro;17 million to address the backlogs in delivery caused by COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  There is no specific apprenticeship in retrofit at the current time.  Retrofit activity covers a range of tasks and professions including craft trades and operative level occupations in the construction sector. Among the 62 apprenticeships available at levels 5-10 of the National Framework of qualifications current apprenticeships which would deliver skills suitable to retrofit activity include plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering and painting and decorating and the recently launched scaffolding apprenticeship. Apprenticeships in roofing and cladding and advanced quantity surveyor (L9) are currently in development.  Additionally, curricula in apprenticeships are updated on an ongoing basis to keep pace with changes in industry practices and regulations. <\/p>  <p>  In responding to the high level of demand for apprenticeship in the construction sector, progress is evident through the launch of apprenticeships in scaffolding and roofing and cladding this year.  An advanced quantity surveyor apprenticeship is also in development.  Moreover, 2,782 of 4,363 applications to receive &euro;3,000 per apprentice under the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, were in construction trades as of the 4th October, representing 4,334 construction-related apprentices entering the sector. <\/p>  <p>  Should there be a skill need for a Retrofit-specific apprenticeship, the development of new apprenticeships is employer-led, with consortia comprising employer groups and educational providers can come together to identify a skills need and appropriate apprenticeship response in their sector.  The Apprenticeship Council examine any proposals arising in the context of identified skills needs. All apprenticeship proposals go through a rigorous evaluation process which is led by the Council, and approval is subject to the application meeting a prescribed set of requirements as set out in the publicly accessible handbook and guidance document<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, under Budget 2022, it has been recognised that the continued upskilling and re-skilling of construction professionals, whether these are professionals, craft or non-craft operatives in Construction and Green Skills is paramount for the delivery of skills under Housing for All, Project Ireland 2040 and general construction sector projects. General provision in areas such as green skills and sustainability, which includes retrofit and NZEB, is ongoing across the FET sector, with some 50+ programmes already running across the sector. NZEB skills training is largely targeted to existing construction professionals. The majority of courses are three days in duration and are validated by City and Guilds.  WWETB is developing a blended model with 2 days online with one day in the training centre.  WWETB have also commissioned the development of a pilot VR programme for retrofit which is expected to be operational by year end. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;78 million for reskilling and upskilling including a &euro;22 million Further Education Green Skills Action programme has been provided under Budget 2022 to ensure that the necessary skills are in place to equip the current and future workforce with the adequate skills for the delivery of critical infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied, that the Budget 2022 package, the range of actions envisaged under the Apprenticeship Action Plan and the wider skills response across the tertiary education system will help ensure that priority skill needs in our economy in the years ahead will be met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200094#WROO02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1967,"content":"<p>Question No. 688 answered with Question No. 687.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Education","counter":1968,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200094#WROO02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1969,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[52624\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200094#WROO02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to increase the number of places for mature students who wish to study nursing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1970,"content":"<p>Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies within the meaning of the <i>Universities Act 1997, <\/i>the <i>Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006, <\/i>and the <i>Technological Universities Act 2018. <\/i>As such, they are entitled to determine the number of places offered in a course under any particular entry route, including places for mature students and it is not within my remit to determine how many such places are offered.<\/p><p>My Department, the HEA and the higher education institutions are committed to supporting the provision of graduates for the health service through undergraduate and postgraduate provision.

Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes.<\/p><p>Under the Department's Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible first time undergraduate students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses. In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including previous education attainment. <\/p><p>Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.<\/p><p>Students accessing graduate entry medicine (GEM) will, as a matter of course, hold a level 8 qualification prior to entry and completion of a graduate entry medicine degree confers a further level 8 qualification. In this regards Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants.<\/p><p>My Department currently has no plans to provide free fees funding for second degree courses under the FFI.<\/p><p>In order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the HEA. In academic year 20\/21 the state contribution is &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.<\/p><p>Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of fees to be charged in the case of GEM fees are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.<\/p><p>Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme. Details of these services and supports are available from the relevant institution.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments approval was given to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. The review is being conducted by external consultants. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy.<\/p><p>Students on graduate entry medicine courses may be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding.<\/p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <\/p><p>In conclusion there are significant policy, legislative and funding considerations, as well as wider implications for other graduate entry courses, to the current treatment of graduate entry medicine course. These are subject to consideration, including as part of the annual Estimates process, as part of the ongoing consideration of student supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200095#WRPP00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2003,"content":"<p>Question No. 700 answered with Question No. 699.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Provision","counter":2004,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200095#WRPP01000"},{"type":"question","counter":2005,"qnumday":701,"qnumall":"[53016\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200095#WRPP01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the 7,000 additional off-the job training places for craft apprentices impacted by Covid-19 will be in place; the total off-the-job training capacity when additional places are added; the cost of each additional place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2006,"content":"<p>2022 will see an increase in excess of 3,100 off-the-job training places being made available across craft apprenticeship phases 2, 4 and 6 over 2021 scheduled numbers (pre-COVID expected provision).

This is a matter for the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions. <\/p>  <p>  The Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 sets out the current law relating to custody and access orders in line with Article 42A.4 of the Constitution, which requires that provision be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings concerning the guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration. Very significant modernisation of the law in this area was brought about in 2015 with the enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which amended extensively the 1964 Act. Section 31 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, inserted by the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when making a determination in such proceedings. These factors include, where applicable, any harm which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering, including harm as a result of household violence, and the protection of the child&rsquo;s safety and psychological well-being.  Section 31 specifies in relation to this particular factor that the court shall have regard to household violence that has occurred or is likely to occur in the household of the child, or a household in which the child has been or is likely to be present, including the impact or likely impact of such violence on:<\/p>  <p>  (a) the safety of the child and other members of the household concerned;<\/p>  <p>  (b) the child&rsquo;s personal well-being, including the child&rsquo;s psychological and emotional well-being;<\/p>  <p>  (c) the victim of such violence;<\/p>  <p>  (d) the capacity of the perpetrator of the violence to properly care for the child and the risk, or likely risk, that the perpetrator poses to the child.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 15 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018, a court dealing with domestic violence proceedings may also make orders under family law legislation without the need for separate proceedings to have been issued. This includes orders relating to access to a child under section 11 of the Guardianship of infants Act 1964. My Department is in the early stages of examining how we can address any policy gaps that may exist where a victim is engaged in parallel civil and criminal (domestic violence) proceedings arising from one incident, and what practical solutions we can offer protect the victim in these circumstances. This is a complex issue, taking into account that the courts involved are independent of each other. It is being discussed within the Family Justice Oversight Group and my Department is also in discussions with a number of NGOs on the matter. It is our intention to take action on this issue in the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual &amp;amp; Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) Services, which is currently being developed with a view to its adoption at the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200096#WRQQ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2092,"content":"<p>Question No. 729 answered with Question No. 728.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2093,"content":"<p>Question No. 730 answered with Question No. 728.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2094,"content":"<p>Question No. 731 answered with Question No. 728.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":2095,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200096#WRQQ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2096,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[52272\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200096#WRQQ04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will address concerns regarding the processing of re-entry visas for children (details supplied) who are holders of an Indian passport; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2097,"content":"<p>I can confirm that an application for a re-entry visa from the person referred to by the Deputy has been processed and my Department has written to them directly to inform them. <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Reforming and modernising our licensing law is an important part of how we do that. <\/p>  <p>  On 15 September 2021, the Government approved the drafting of the General Scheme of the Sale of Alcohol Bill 2021 to reform and modernise licensing laws in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The outdated Licensing Acts, Registration of Clubs Acts, and the Public Dance Hall Act 1935, will all be repealed and replaced with updated and streamlined 21st century provisions relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises and registered clubs. This will reform, streamline and simplify our licensing laws.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing whether a review of legislation is required in relation to the delivery of alcohol, it is essential that there is a clear understanding of what the current regulations are under existing legislation.<\/p>  <p>  While there is no dedicated licence for online sales of intoxicating liquor, licensees of licensed premises may engage in online sales subject to certain restrictive conditions.

For the most part, this generally requires a response within community and institutional - including schools - contexts, rather than an automatic resort to criminal sanction.  <\/p><p>That said, this Government is acutely aware of the impact any kind of harassment can have on a victim and that harassment can take different forms and have different levels of severity.<\/p><p>That is why the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 &ndash; or Coco&rsquo;s Law, named after Nicole &lsquo;Coco&rsquo; Fox &ndash; not only introduced new offences but also broadened existing harassment offences and introduced stricter penalties for them.<\/p><p>Coco's Law provides for a new offence of sending, distributing or publishing a threatening or grossly offensive message by any means of communication with intent to cause harm to the victim, which means our legislation now covers once-off communications as well as harassment.<\/p><p>The definition of harassment includes harassing another person by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with or about them.

The funding has enabled Webwise to update the materials used in schools to include information about Coco&rsquo;s Law. <\/p><p>The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act also provides for offences that cause harm to another person and also for the offence of making someone believe they are going to be harmed.

This legislation encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction, including domestic altruistic surrogacy.<\/p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions of the Bill outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate to the intending parent(s).<\/p>  <p>  Publication of the AHR Bill is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This Department will continue to engage intensively with the Office of the Attorney General in order to finalise this complex legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions, nor does it provide for retrospective declarations of parentage. Issues which arise from the undertaking of surrogacy arrangements in other jurisdictions and the assignment of retrospective parentage concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments and require detailed examination. My Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of these matters.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the provisions outlined within the Bill will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200099#WRTT03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200099#WRTT03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2246,"qnumday":778,"qnumall":"[51981\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200099#WRTT03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of the &euro;286,000 that was allocated for expansion of services in the medical assessment unit as of December 2020 that has been drawn down by Ennis General Hospital.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2247,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200099#WRTT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2249,"qnumday":779,"qnumall":"[51982\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200099#WRTT03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the levels of services in the medical assessment unit of Ennis General Hospital have increased to 204 units per week as committed to in 2020;

While the number of overdue Assessment of Need stood at 6,558 in June 2020, through a combination of different measures, by the end of September 2021 approximately 6,040 children have had their assessment completed, thus reducing the backlog to 520 cases.

While not required by the Act, diagnostic assessments will continue to be provided, as appropriate, and these will be captured in the child&rsquo;s Service Statement as part of the Assessment of Need process. <\/p>  <p>  These improvements, particularly the new Preliminary Team Assessment, will facilitate children with disabilities to access assessment much quicker. This is borne out by the latest data I have from the HSE which indicates that over 90% of children who have had a Preliminary Team Assessment are referred for intervention.<\/p>  <p>  All of these improvements are intended to alleviate the current situation where children in some parts of the country may have to wait a number of years before they can access an assessment and I am satisfied that the system is making best use of available professional resource.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200100#WRUU03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":2316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200100#WRUU03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2317,"qnumday":800,"qnumall":"[52052\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200100#WRUU03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the fact that young persons are waiting up to 20 weeks for an appointment with Jigsaw;

The natural history, clinical course and consequences of COVID19 are still not completely understood. It is recognised that most patients with COVID-19 return to baseline after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, but a proportion report ongoing health issues.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people that are affected with longer term sequelae after acute COVID-19 remains unknown, but published reports indicate that approximately 10&ndash; 20% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. <\/p>  <p>  Several organisations and societies have proposed different definitions based upon the constellation of symptoms that affect people after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. To aid recognition and management of those affected, the WHO has recently through a global consensus process proposed a working clinical case definition of Post COVID-19 syndrome occurring 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction and others which generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute COVID19 episode, or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time. However, the WHO notes that this definition may change as new evidence emerges and our understanding of the consequences of COVID-19 continues to evolve.<\/p>  <p>  COVID-19 in children is usually asymptomatic or manifests as a mild illness of short duration. However, concerns have been raised regarding prolonged illness in some children, with no clear resolution of symptoms several weeks after onset, as is observed in some adults and this is an area of ongoing research. Studies to date have identified that long illness duration after SARS-CoV-2 infection in school-aged children does occur but is uncommon and less common than is reported in adults. In most studies of children affected, symptoms are reported to have resolved or significantly decreased over time, providing reassurance about long-term outcomes. Additionally, studies suggest that the symptom burden in children with what has been termed long COVID-19 was not greater than that in children with long illnesses due to causes other than SARS-CoV-2 infection.<\/p>  <p>  Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. People in the community who are concerned about persistent symptoms following Covid-19 should contact their GP in the first instance. Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms. <\/p>  <p>  Specific guidance on the treatment of 'Long COVID' is presently under development both here and internationally.  The HSE is currently assessing need and the best way to care for those impacted by Long COVID to ensure the appropriate supports are in place. As part of this work on post-COVID care, the HSE is examining how it can model the possible numbers that will be affected, noting that this will take time as more evidence emerges. I understand that the HSE has also been in touch with a group of people who are suffering post-COVID symptoms to inform understanding. You may wish to note, that a  Programme Manager\/Implementation Lead and Clinical Leads have been identified within the HSE who will be key stakeholders in driving this programme of work.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, through the Health Research Board, continues to fund research into the clinical impacts of COVID-19.

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.<\/p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>On the 7<sup>th<\/sup>October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.<\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>The NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected.

This legislation encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction, including domestic altruistic surrogacy.<\/p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions of the Bill outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate to the intending parent(s).<\/p>  <p>  Publication of the AHR Bill is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This Department will continue to engage intensively with the Office of the Attorney General in order to finalise this complex legislation.<\/p>  <p>The draft Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions.  Issues which arise from the undertaking of surrogacy arrangements in other jurisdictions concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments and require detailed examination. My Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of these matters.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of supports available for AHR treatment, although AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this support, a commitment to introduce the model of care for infertility, which was developed by officials in my Department in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme, is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.<\/p>  <p>  The model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments). Structured referral pathways are being put in place and patients referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks in the six Hospital Groups across the country, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced.<\/p>  <p>  The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200107#WRBBB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2687,"content":"<p>Question No. 928 answered with Question No. 777.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":2688,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200107#WRBBB03400"},{"type":"question","counter":2689,"qnumday":929,"qnumall":"[52508\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200107#WRBBB03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the recommended number of neurology specialist nurses for St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital considering the catchment area and best practice guidelines; the actual number of neurology specialist nurses at the hospital; the current plans in place to address shortages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2690,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200107#WRBBB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2691,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200107#WRBBB03700"},{"type":"question","counter":2692,"qnumday":930,"qnumall":"[52512\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200107#WRBBB03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the process available for persons who have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine but have been advised on medical grounds not to get the second dose of the same vaccine; the persons or bodies such persons can contact to resolve this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2693,"content":"<p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services. It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. <\/p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service delivery.  <\/p><p>With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA recently ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.  <\/p><p>In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services. <\/p><p>The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home support is scheduled to commence in November 2021 in CHO 8  (Longford \/ West Meath).  Recruitment issues associated with backfilling of posts has impacted on release of interRAI Care Coordinators in CHO 2 (Galway), 4 (South Lee) and 7 (Dublin West). This has necessitated phased introduction of pilot sites however it is expected that all will be fully operational by January 2022. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to inform legislative and funding decisions in relation to the statutory home support scheme. <\/p><p>Recruitment of the 130 posts funded for the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs is scheduled to commence in this quarter. In addition, a National Home Support Office will be established before the end of the year.<\/p><p>The <i>Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023<\/i>commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. Budget 2021 and the subsequent Health Service Executive National Service Plan allowed for an unprecedented increase in investment in home care and intermediate care to be delivered in the community. This high level of investment is being maintained into 2022. Details of how this will be delivered in 2022, including the additional 5 million home support hours provided for in Budget 2021, to be maintained in 2022, will be finalised as part of the National Service Plan process.  In addition the proportion of hours ringfenced for people with dementia will more than double, from 5% in 2021 to 11% in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2770,"content":"<p>Question No. 957 answered with Question No. 777.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2771,"content":"<p>Question No. 958 answered with Question No. 777.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Assisted Human Reproduction","counter":2772,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2773,"qnumday":959,"qnumall":"[52674\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has consulted with or has plans to meet and invite input into the draft legislation from Irish families through surrogacy; his views on the fact that these families are dealing with the daily implications of the legal limbo they are living through in the absence of any legislation and are best placed to help inform legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2774,"qnumday":980,"qnumall":"[52746\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if in relation to the assisted human reproduction Bill, it is intended to legislate for international surrogacy; when legislation recognising international surrogacy and retrospective declaration of parentage will be complete; and if his Department will engage with an organisation (details supplied) on this proposed legislation.","asker":"1468","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2775,"qnumday":1018,"qnumall":"[52915\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will clarify recent reports that international surrogacy will be excluded from the upcoming assisted human reproduction Bill (details supplied); when legislation recognising international surrogacy alongside retrospective declaration of parentage will be published; if a group will have input into the draft legislation to ensure no child is left behind; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2776,"qnumday":1104,"qnumall":"[53285\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 356 of 21 October 2021, the timeframe for publication of the Bill on assisted human reproduction; the steps he has taken to consult with stakeholders including the AHR community regarding the Bill; if the Bill will encompass international surrogacy; if not, the reason; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2777,"qnumday":1157,"qnumall":"[53395\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address matters raised in correspondence (details supplied).","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2778,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 959, 980, 1018, 1104 and 1157 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, drafting of a bill on assisted human reproduction (AHR) and associated areas of research is ongoing by officials in my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.

The number of GPs on the specialist register continues to increase, up from 2,270 in 2010 to 4,224 in September 2021. However, holding registration does not necessarily mean that a medical practitioner is active in general practice at this time, nor does it equate to full time practitioners.  The number of GPs contracted to provide services to GMS patients has increased in the past 10 years from 2,258 to 2,531, an increase of 12%.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am very aware of the workforce issues facing general practice, including changing demographics, the number of GPs nearing retirement, the difficulties in filling a small number of GMS vacancies, and the impact of the shift towards care centred in the community on general practice.  <\/p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. In addition to the increases in the number of GP training places, changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible\/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the recent transfer of responsibility for GP training to the Irish College of General Practitioners will bring GP training in line with other medical specialties where responsibility for training lies with the respective vocational bodies. This transfer will allow for a further expansion in the number of training places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2787,"content":"<p>Question No. 964 answered with Question No. 777.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2788,"content":"<p>Question No. 965 answered with Question No. 931.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2789,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2790,"qnumday":966,"qnumall":"[52697\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200109#WRDDD03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to countries setting expiry dates on Covid-19 vaccines and the impact this could have on Irish Travellers should they not be offered booster jabs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2791,"content":"<p>The EU Digital COVID Certificate is a document which is issued to help facilitate enable the safe and free international movement of people across the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reimbursement for medicines under the community drugs schemes is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority. <\/p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. The Minister for health has no role in these decisions. The HSE have advised that PCBD110 is not reimbursable under the community drugs schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The Medical Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP) is a 5-year pilot programme. The MCAP allows medical consultants to prescribe specified cannabis-based products for patients with certain medical conditions who have exhausted all other available medical treatment options.

The onus is on prospective suppliers to submit applications to the HPRA.<\/p>  <p>  For medical indications not included in the MCAP, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licensing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients. In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment, including cannabis treatment, for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient.

This guidance came into effect on 19 July. The public health advice is to restore visiting to near normal in terms of frequency of visits in those settings with a high level of vaccination of residents as quickly as possible, while also recognising the need to remain cautious as we continue to deal with the evolving risks associated with COVID-19.<\/p><p>The guidance provides that:<\/p><p>- Providers should put in place the necessary measures to progress to more normalised visiting and visiting frequency as quickly as possible in line with public health guidance with no more than two visitors at any one time.<\/p><p>- Routine visiting will no longer need to be scheduled in advance.<\/p><p>- There is no requirement to have a list of nominated visitors.<\/p><p>- The duration of the visit should not be limited.<\/p><p>- Fewer restrictions will apply to residents going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home.<\/p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. In a broad sense, visits to nursing homes are governed by legislation under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013; regulation 11 provides that the nursing home should facilitate visiting and not restrict visiting except in circumstances such as the resident requesting same, or potential risk posed from visiting &ndash; this aligns with the risk assessments referred to in the visiting guidance.  The regulations also require that the nursing home has suitable facilities in place and available for residents to receive visits. It is the legal responsibility of each provider to assess the risks and mitigation measures associated with their service and how best to manage visits having regards to the specific circumstances that arise in relation to their service. The HPSC has developed public health guidance, mentioned above, to assist and support providers in this regard.<\/p><p>It must be noted that risks continue to remain and emergent risks such as variants of concern present ongoing challenges and the need for vigilance.

In relation to e-cigarettes, the Directive sets maximum nicotine concentrations and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers. Health warnings advising consumers that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which is a highly addictive substance are also mandatory.

substance which is controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and can be harmful to human health if consumed. The Department of Health is concerned that consumption of these illegal cannabis edibles would pose significant public health risks. The Department is in close contact with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and other State Agencies working to curb the availability of these products in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The FSAI initiated engagement with the Department of Education when it became aware of these illegal cannabis edibles being available in some school settings. Some schools had already sent out alerts to parents earlier in 2021 of their own volition warning parents of the dangers and potential availability of these edibles in the school setting. The FSAI advice on illegal cannabis edibles formed a short entry in the Department of Education circular to schools and was meant as a proactive measure by FSAI to encourage parents and guardians to proactively discuss the dangers of illegal cannabis edibles with their children in case they are offered to them in a school or social setting. This proactive approach by FSAI is justified by the evidence of availability of illegal cannabis edibles from Garda and customs seizures in 2021 along with the Irish Medical Journal publication about the hospitalisation of six children under ten years of age suffering serious health consequences after unwittingly consuming illegal cannabis edibles carelessly stored by older siblings and other people.<\/p>  <p>  Statutory Instrument 262\/2019 &ldquo;The Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019&rdquo; sets out the legal provisions for the operation of the Medical Cannabis Access Programme and the legal obligations for healthcare professionals and commercial operators. It also sets out how the access programme will work, who can avail of it, how it will be operated by the HSE and how cannabis-based products, made from whole dried flowers of the plant, are accepted for use under the programme and placed on Schedule 1 of the Regulations SI. Given the legislative basis of the programme and the fact that patients availing of the MCAP are being monitored by their treating consultants I would trust that there would no conflation between that and illicit use of a harmful controlled substance.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3039,"content":"<p>Question No. 1056 answered with Question No. 1055.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":3040,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":3041,"qnumday":1057,"qnumall":"[53084\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the Sunday day care centre in Leopardstown Hospital; the measures being taken to reopen fully for its patrons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3042,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":3043,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":3044,"qnumday":1058,"qnumall":"[53090\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has set a policy that overseas doctors can only obtain a six month contract; and if this practice makes it more difficult to attract such staff and disrupts the sort of continuity which manpower and care planning requires.","asker":"1549","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3045,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":3046,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":3047,"qnumday":1059,"qnumall":"[53095\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200114#WRJJJ04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of his Department&rsquo;s budget for 2022 which is being considered as part of Official Development Assistance in the context of international aid; the measures this budget will be spent on; the section in his Department that will be overseeing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3048,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs is the lead Department with responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance programme and it works closely with the relevant policy units in my Department.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2021, &euro;1,603,799.28 was paid by my Department in assessed contributions to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p><p>At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine). The HIQA has confirmed that this HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021\/2022 and I have requested that my officials give consideration to the outcome of this work in the context of the immunisation programme.<\/p><p>As this is an operational query, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200115#WRKKK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":3089,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200115#WRKKK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":3090,"qnumday":1073,"qnumall":"[53145\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200115#WRKKK03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients attending the paediatric diabetic clinic, Mullingar, County Westmeath.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3091,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200115#WRKKK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Policy","counter":3092,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200115#WRKKK03500"},{"type":"question","counter":3093,"qnumday":1074,"qnumall":"[53153\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200115#WRKKK03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he plans to extend the list of persons who can refer persons for an x-ray to include registered physiotherapists and to create the grade of advanced practice physiotherapist; if legislation is in preparation to legislate for such a change; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3094,"content":"<p>Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM (the BSSD), insofar as it relates to the designation of referrers, was fully transposed by the European Union (Basic Safety Standards for Protection Against Dangers Arising from Medical Exposure to Ionising Radiation) Regulations 2018 (S.I.

All persons, irrespective of illness or condition, accessing public in-patient (including day case) services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory in-patient daily charge of &euro;80 up to a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 consecutive months, subject to a number of exemptions which include:<\/p><p>-  medical card holders;<\/p><p>-  people receiving treatment for prescribed infectious diseases - including Coronavirus (Covid-19);<\/p><p>-  people who are subject to 'long-stay' charges;<\/p><p>-  children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school board examinations;<\/p><p>-  people who are eligible for hospital services because of EU Regulations;<\/p><p>-  women receiving maternity services;<\/p><p>-  children up to 6 weeks of age;<\/p><p>-  people with hepatitis C who have a Health Amendment Card; and<\/p><p>-  people who are part of the Redress Scheme for Women Resident in Certain Institutions. <\/p><p>The Deputy has also asked about treatment abroad for endometriosis. The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled under EU Regulation 883\/04.  The TAS is a consultant lead scheme and allows for an Ireland-based public consultant to refer a public patient who is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in the public healthcare system of another EU member state, the UK or Switzerland. Subject to the EU Regulations and Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved public treatments in another EU\/EEA member state, the UK or Switzerland through the issue of form S2 (IE) where the treatment is:<\/p><p>-  among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation;<\/p><p>-  not available in Ireland;<\/p><p>-  not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease. <\/p><p>-  medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs;<\/p><p>-  a proven form of medical treatment and not experimental or test treatment;<\/p><p>-  provided in a recognised public hospital or other institution that will accept EU\/EEA form S2 (IE) and;<\/p><p>-  is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Deputy may be aware of the Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme (NI PHS) has been in effective operation since 1 January 2021. This Scheme was introduced to mitigate the loss of access to care from private providers in Northern Ireland under the EU Cross Border Directive, which ceased to apply as a result of Brexit.

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.<\/p>  <p>  GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP.<\/p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 this year, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible\/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":3325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":3326,"qnumday":1156,"qnumall":"[53394\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the school dentist waiting list and the fact that currently primary school children are not receiving any appointments in south-western areas of County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3327,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3328,"content":"<p>Question No. 1157 answered with Question No. 959.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":3329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01500"},{"type":"question","counter":3330,"qnumday":1158,"qnumall":"[53396\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps that are being taken to recruit neurology nurse specialists for Cork University Hospital given the unit is short of specialised staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3331,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":3332,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01800"},{"type":"question","counter":3333,"qnumday":1159,"qnumall":"[53407\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200120#WRPPP01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he plans to publish the McHugh report on student nurses and midwives pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3334,"content":"<p>The McHugh report has required careful consideration including briefing and examination by a range of Departmental officials across multiple areas.

Attachment 1 shows (1) the number of TB tests carried out on animals from 2016 to date in 2021 and (2) Herd incidence which is the positivity rate of herds tested for the same period.  There are positive indications of progress though; the TB situation for 2021 is likely to represent an improvement compared to 2020. <\/p><p>Attachment 2 shows the expenditure breakdown of the bovine TB programme from 2016 to 2020 - including cost of tests, EU contribution and Exchequer contribution. These figures and the methodology underpinning them were recently published in a cost benefit analysis report completed by Grant Thornton. Final figures for 2021 will be published at the end of the year but year to date figures indicate spending has increased by 19% over the same period last year. As part of my on-going commitment to eradicating this disease, I have sanctioned an additional &euro;1m in funding, for 2022, for the wildlife programme which is an integral element of the overall programme.<\/p><p>While the farmer contribution to the programme is significant at an estimated &euro;35 million, this has remained broadly stable since 2017. Conversely, the contribution from the Irish taxpayer increased by over &euro;11 million from &euro;46 million to &euro;57 million between 2018 and 2020. This rate of increase is not sustainable. There will be a decrease in EU funding towards the programme in 2022 and again in subsequent years and there is a strong possibility that EU will cease funding entirely. <\/p><p>I am acutely aware of the financial and emotional burden associated with a TB breakdown and we must do everything we can, working together as a sector, to tackle this problem. Earlier this year, I launched a new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021- 2030. The implementation of this strategy is overseen by the established TB Stakeholder Forum along with support from three working groups on science, implementation, and finance to ensure that all aspects of the Strategy are addressed. <\/p><p>I would like to direct you to <i>www.bovinetb.ie<\/i>where both the Grant Thornton Cost Benefit analysis and the TB Strategy are published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200122#WRRRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Safety","counter":3440,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200122#WRRRR01800"},{"type":"question","counter":3441,"qnumday":1193,"qnumall":"[52433\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200122#WRRRR01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his proposals to spend the &euro;2 million in additional funds allocated to farm safety in budget 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3442,"content":"<p>To highlight the importance of farm safety, the Government assigned my ministerial colleague, Martin Heydon, TD the specific responsibility for Farm Safety in his portfolio.<\/p><p>The Department currently has in place a range of measures to promote farm safety.

Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, have ultimate responsibility for the development and implementation of the bovine TB eradication programme. In doing so I am supported, in my Department, by the ERAD, Ruminant Animal Health Divisions and by the 16 Regional Veterinary Offices throughout the country whose work is overseen by 2 Area Management Teams. <\/p><p>Ireland's bovine TB Eradication Programme is in line with best national and international scientific research and advice. A large body of peer-reviewed research has been conducted into the spread of bovine TB (bTB) in Ireland and the risks underlying its transmission. This research has found that the principle causes of bTB spread include the movement of cattle with undetected infection, residual infection in cattle previously exposed to bTB, but not identified at that point as being infected, spread across farm boundaries, indirect spread through biosecurity breaches, and spread from infected badgers into cattle. This research has recently been reviewed in its entirety for the Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum by its Scientific Working Group which is composed of a panel of internationally recognised experts in bTB research. The results of that review are available on gov.ie - TB Forum (www.gov.ie).<\/p><p>The Deputy raised earlier PQs (PQ41707\/21 &amp;amp; PQ41708\/21) regarding the full extent of testing, the replies to which are now attached. The scientific opinion from the Scientific Working Group concludes that the bTB programme should address, at both national and local levels, all relevant sources of transmission of bTB to cattle. Current relevant sources include all cattle sources that substantially contribute to herd infection, and all wildlife that are maintenance hosts, and particularly those with spillback to cattle. The Scientific Working Group concludes that:<\/p><p>o badgers do contribute to bTB in cattle in Ireland, which is addressed through my Departments badger vaccination and culling programmes operated under licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service;<\/p><p>o deer-to-cattle spread is only likely to occur to any meaningful extent in Co Wicklow. My Department supports deer control by advising farmers to manage deer populations on their land, including through culling where necessary and by providing free testing of deer for bTB through the Regional Veterinary Laboratory network.<\/p><p>The bacteria, which causes bTB in cattle and badgers, can cause TB in humans but it is responsible for approximately 1-4% of human infections. In general, there are c.300-400 cases of human TB in Ireland annually, less than 10 of which are caused by the bacteria associated with bTB. Some may be associated with drinking unpasteurised milk but bTB infection in milk is rare because the Programme identifies and removes infected cattle. Additional surveillance is carried out though checks at post-mortem examination of all slaughtered cattle in Ireland. The programme is successful in minimising the threat to human health from bTB through early identification of infection and removal of exposed animals. Further reductions in bTB, envisaged by the implementation of the recommendations of the TB Stakeholder Forum through the new strategy which I introduced this year, will result in ongoing reduction of exposure to human health from the current very low levels. The strategy is available at www.bovinetb.ie<\/p><p> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200123#WRSSS00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3483,"content":"<p>Question No. 1210 answered with Question No. 1172.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3484,"content":"<p>Question No. 1211 answered with Question No. 1209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":3485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200123#WRSSS01200"},{"type":"question","counter":3486,"qnumday":1212,"qnumall":"[52556\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200123#WRSSS01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the breakdown between EU versus Exchequer funding in the allocation of &euro;180 million for the Leader programme in the indicative allocations for pillar II (rural development) measures.","asker":"1613","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3487,"content":"<p>An indicative allocation of &euro;180 million has been made to the LEADER Programme for the 2023-2027 period under the CAP Strategic Plan.

Carbon tax funding over the period will be used to fund our flagship Agri-Environmental Climate Measure (AECM), in keeping with the Programme for Government commitment to spend &euro;1.5 billion over the period to 2030 to help farmers to farm in a more environmentally sustainable way.  <\/p>  <p>  The AECM will deliver a range of environmental, climate and biodiversity benefits by supporting farmers to undertake appropriate actions.

This followed a large triage exercise undertaken by my Department of licences on hand for processing.  This exercise has allowed us to significantly increase our output of forestry licences with over 750 private sector felling licences issued since the 1st June. However, approximately half of the requests for further information from applicants and their foresters remain unanswered and cannot be processed until they are submitted. <\/p>  <p>  At the time these applications were submitted, in general, they were not considered sub-standard.  This is why the applications were not returned close to the time the applications were received. However, my Department has had to change the way in which forestry licence applications are assessed, following certain Court of Justice of the European Union and High Court decisions.  The Deputy may be aware that this significant change in procedure led to delays and a need to re-train foresters, provide new guidance on applications and to the recruitment of a large cohort of ecologists. <\/p>  <p>  Registered Foresters have been advised of the additional information that is likely to be required to process applications for felling , roads and afforestation in Circular 08\/2021, which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Applicants in consultation with their Registered Forester should review this circular in relation to applications in the system and future applications. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to felling licence application the position is that the provision of a harvest plan at application stage is not a legal requirement.  However, applicants are strongly encouraged to include them with their licence application.  Where not provided at application stage, the Department often subsequently requires a harvest plan or other information about the felling so that the Department can satisfy itself that the project will not have an adverse effect on the environment.  <\/p>  <p>  In June 2019 a Template Harvest Plan was developed for the sector and Circular 11 of 2019 encouraged its use.  DAFM Circular 18 of 2020 confirms that for sites that are screened in for Appropriate Assessment, a well-developed Harvest Plan (or equivalent) is essential, as it is likely to inform part or all of the site level mitigation associated with the appropriate assessment.

ICCAT is an intergovernmental fishery organisation responsible for the conservation of tunas in the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas.  It has 52 contracting parties including the EU, US, Japan, Norway and Iceland.  <\/p>  <p>  Fifteen ICCAT members have quota allocations for Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (BFT), including the EU, Norway and Iceland.  The Faroe Islands is not a contracting party to ICCAT and is not allocated a quota for BFT by ICCAT.  For 2021, ICCAT set the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of Bluefin Tuna at 36,000 tonnes, of which 19,460 tonnes was allocated to the EU, 300 tonnes to Norway and 180 tonnes to Iceland.  <\/p>  <p>  Data published by ICCAT indicates that Norway has landed 248 tonnes of BFT over the period 2018 to 2020 (inclusive).  Iceland and the Faroe Islands have not landed any BFT in this same period.<\/p>  <p>  The EU percentage share of the international TAC is set down and there is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  Bluefin Tuna is a highly migratory large pelagic species which spawns in the Mediterranean and then migrates over a wide area of the North East Atlantic to feed.  This migration brings some of the fish into the Irish 200 miles zone for part of the year. At the time we see fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain to Norway.  There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 miles zone may be determined.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU's quota for Bluefin Tuna is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s.  At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.  <\/p>  <p>  The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU and would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system.

Gas prices are expected to remain strong into next year and is likely to see high fertiliser prices. <\/p>  <p>  There are no fertilisers manufactured in Ireland, rather fertiliser companies blend a number of imported fertiliser products into different compositions suitable for agricultural use in Ireland. Indigenous fertiliser companies are dependent on global supply and demand and subject to euro exchange rates against the US dollar and other currencies on the price they pay for fertiliser.<\/p>  <p>  Russia is an important global player in the production of fertiliser and accounted for over 20% of fertiliser imports into Ireland in 2020. There is no ban on protected urea from Russia. However, urea is a product that is traded globally where its availability and price are subject to global market conditions. <\/p>  <p>   The European Commission is following the situation in relation to fertiliser price increases very closely and is of the view that increased costs must be shared by all participants in the food chain.

contract. Initially, these sites were considered an interim measure for those areas likely to wait longest for permanent connections under the NBP - publicly accessible internet for those without adequate connectivity at home. However, as the BCP network build began, it became very clear that great potential existed to develop BCPs as digitally-enabled, long-term community assets. <\/p><p>Against the backdrop of the public health crisis and the attendant exponential growth in demand for remote working facilities and travel restrictions, the role of BCPs has rapidly evolved. Communities expect their BCPs to be remote working hubs as well as study and training spaces. Many communities also want to take part in cultural activities and share their own creativity with others. <\/p><p>In response, my Department and the local authority Broadband Officers upgraded the technical specifications at the majority of BCPs allowing for additional functionality, such as you would expect in any professional workplace, and also began trialling new activities and services. These trials serve two purposes: they establish what may work well at BCPs and they also encourage those managing BCPs to imagine other uses for the high-speed connectivity that has been provided.<\/p><p>Trial projects may either be available to all operational BCPs, or may be limited to a few selected sites. Where there is a limit to the number of sites that may take part in a trial, these sites were selected on a first come, first served basis, or on the basis of a needs and suitability assessment.<\/p><p>There are currently 18 pilot projects live under the following four headings, including the following examples:<\/p><p><b>-  eHealth<\/b>- dedicated e-health rooms in Co. Sligo and on both Tory &amp;amp; Clare Islands: These e-health facilities will complement the HSE Attend Anywhere initiative and be suitable for a range of virtual consultations.<\/p><p><b>-  Training &amp;amp; Education<\/b>- adult digital literacy training; CoderDojo and OurKidsCode for children and families<\/p><p><b>-  Arts &amp;amp; Culture<\/b>- a nationwide BCP film festival curated by the IFI; tuition in the Uilleann pipes by NPU <\/p><p><b>-  Remote Working<\/b>&ndash; training for hub managers provided by the Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen; Grow Remote chapter training.<\/p><p>There is no charge to the BCPs or the public for participation in any of the trial activities. Furthermore, grants of &euro;1,000 are available for devices and equipment to support training and education activities and &euro;10,000 has been made available to each local authority to procure additional activities or training, either under the headings above or under another heading as proposed by the Broadband Officer. <\/p><p>Details of events at BCPs can be found at myconnectedcommunity.ie\/events\/. This recently added function on the BCP network&rsquo;s website will be updated over the coming months with additional details as new events are added. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200126#WRVVV04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers","counter":3660,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200126#WRVVV04700"},{"type":"question","counter":3661,"qnumday":1276,"qnumall":"[53343\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110200126#WRVVV04800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"her plans to progress phase 3 of the development of Caladh M&oacute;r pier on Inis Me&aacute;in.","asker":"1579","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":3662,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, Galway County Council are the body responsible for development of stage three of the Caladh M&oacute;r pier development on Inis Me&aacute;in.
