I raise this matter because it is of significant importance in County Clare.  I was on the way to Dublin on Tuesday while I listened to local radio.  An independent councillor for whom I would have much regard in County Clare, Councillor Ann Norton, relayed her experience in the accident and emergency unit in University Hospital Limerick, where her daughter had been a patient.  She outlined a series of events that were very worrying.  The Government and the Minister have invested significantly, particularly capital investment, in trying to deal with the ongoing challenges people face in the accident and emergency unit in University Hospital Limerick.  The Government has opened a new unit in Limerick at a cost of more than &euro;20 million to try to deal with the problem of people waiting on trolleys, etc.  It was very disappointing to hear of Councillor Norton's experience with her daughter, as well as the experience of others who have approached me in recent times to say that people are on trolleys for significant periods at the hospital accident and emergency department.  The Government has made an investment in excess of &euro;20 million but the problem persists.<\/p> <p>After the Government and Minister have invested such money to deal with the problem, why are we in this position in Limerick, with people on hospital trolleys waiting to be dealt with?  Is there another issue of which people are not aware?  Perhaps there is a management issue.  I tabled this matter because I am very concerned about what is happening in Limerick.  It affects not only people in Limerick but those who live in north and south Tipperary, as well as County Clare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#A00500","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this very important issue.  I am here on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who wishes that I update the House on the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that too many patients continue to wait on trolleys for admission to hospitals on a daily basis.  I wish to acknowledge the distress that overcrowding in emergency departments causes to patients, their families and the front-line staff who work in extremely difficult conditions in hospitals throughout the country.<\/p> <p>Tackling overcrowding in emergency departments is a key commitment of this Government, and additional funding of &euro;40 million has been made available in 2017, as part of the 2018 budget, to address the winter pressures on waiting lists across the country.  This additional funding is aimed at reducing overcrowding in our hospital, including University Hospital Limerick through the provision of extra capacity and additional support.<\/p> <p>The emergency department at University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country with 65,000 attendances annually.  Demand for service in the emergency department continues to rise.  The HSE data for the end of October 2017 indicated that attendance at the emergency department has risen by almost 5% and that admissions through the emergency department has increased by more than 10% as compared to the same period last year.  In recognition of the high demand, funding of &euro;24 million was provided for the new emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, which opened in May 2017.  The new emergency department is three times the size of the former emergency department and provides modern, safe and fit for purpose facilities that meets patients' and families' expectations.  At the same time the new facility provides high quality comfortable accommodation that protects patients' privacy and dignity.  Notwithstanding this investment, the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick continues to be challenged and there are too many patients on trolleys on a daily basis.  Mindful of this issue, the Minister for Health and his officials in the Department convened a meeting in October with the chief executive officer of the University Hospital Limerick and the HSE to discuss this issue.  Following this meeting, an emergency department improvement plan was submitted by the University Limerick Hospital Group.  The plan is being implemented and is being monitored by the Department of Health.  In addition, as part of the &euro;40 million funding announced for the winter measures as part of budge 2018, 17 new beds have been opened in University Hospital Limerick in December and this site is availing of four additional home care packages and two additional transitional care beds per week during the winter months.  In addition, as part of a proactive and integrated approach to winter planning, the hospital groups, hospitals and the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and primary care providers have put in place winter plans in order that the health service is ready for the increased demand for health services and, in particular, for emergency department services in the months ahead.  I can confirm that University Hospital Limerick has such a plan in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#B00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the detail in the Minister of State's reply.

I have taken this opportunity to highlight the issue and I sincerely hope that during the Christmas period as few as possible will have to experience lying on a trolley in University Hospital Limerick.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister on making a capital investment of &euro;24 million in the hospital, which is a significant investment.

I have received a number of emails from members of the public who are running into trouble in that regard, particularly in the area of passports.

In response to further parliamentary questions tabled by Deputy Louise O'Reilly, the answers omitted a timeline that was requested by us, suggesting that the Department is working to resolve a small number of technical issues involving the commencement of Parts 2 and 3.  My first question is whether there is a timeline for the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Child and Family Relationships Act?

As Senator Warfield is aware, the Minister for Health is responsible for the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act and associated regulations.  As well as making regulations in respect of donor assisted human reproduction procedures, Parts 2 and 3 of the Act make provision for children conceived through the assistance of a donor.  This includes mandating for non-anonymous donation and the establishment of a national donor-conceived person register to enable children to access information on their donor and genetically related siblings when they come of age, should they wish to do so.  These provisions were specifically included in the Act to underpin the rights of the child under Article 42A of the Constitution of Ireland's commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to have information on their genetic heritage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Parts 2 and 3 also provide legal clarity on parental rights and responsibilities.

It is a huge issue in my part of the world.  At the moment, we have up to 1,800 or 2,000 students repeating the leaving certificate every year.  A majority of these students have access to school transport but because they are outside the timelines for applying, they are not eligible to get a seat and are then outside the criteria.  They could have used a bus for five or six years.  However, because they are repeating the leaving certificate, they do not qualify for a bus because they did not apply in time.  The application date for a seat is 5 May.  Students do not get their leaving certificate results until 16 August so, realistically, the only way I can see around the issue, if a protocol is not put in place, is that students who do their leaving certificate should apply for their seats for the next year just in case they repeat their leaving certificate.  That is an illogical way of dealing with the issue.<\/p> <p>This is a practical problem.  We have people who are trying to improve their results, work hard and do what they can but they are denied seats on buses because they are outside the timelines despite the fact they had a bus seat for six years.  This is not a budgetary issue but is in many ways a protocol issue to ensure that this cohort of students, who are doing their utmost to ensure that they improve their grades and where they go in life, can have ease of access to the nearest place of education.  We need a special protocol for leaving certificate students who repeat the leaving certificate.  Over 1,800 are repeating the leaving certificate this year.  The majority of them were on the school bus system for five to six years and they need to have access to that.  At the moment, if there is no seat available, they have no access and the line they get from the Department is that they did not apply on time.  It is illogical to have leaving certificate students applying for a bus for next year just in case they do not get certain results.<\/p> <p>We need to have flexibility in the Department.  I can describe many instances where people who have been on the bus for six years repeat their leaving certificate but because they did not apply on time, they have no bus for the year in which they are repeating the leaving certificate.  It is a huge issue.  I hope I can get a suitable protocol put in place in the near future because these students deserve school transport and access to education.  It is a very practical issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#C00400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  Over 114,000 children, including almost 12,000 children with special educational needs, are transported in over 4,500 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million km at a cost of approximately &euro;190 million annually.  The purpose of the post-primary school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside somewhere remote from their nearest school.<\/p> <p>Children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary centre as determined by the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  The closing date for applications for school transport is the last Friday in April each year and the closing date for submitting payment details is the last Friday in July.  However, Bus &Eacute;ireann continues to process applications and payments after these deadline dates and where possible children are accommodated on school transport services where spare seats are available.  Children who wish to repeat their leaving certificate examinations should liaise with their local Bus &Eacute;ireann office if they wish to avail of school transport for the next school year.  Where there is spare capacity on existing services, Bus &Eacute;ireann will issue tickets for these children.  However, if all seats on a particular service have been allocated already then it may not be possible to facilitate children repeating their leaving certificate.  It is not practical for Bus &Eacute;ireann to maintain spare seats on every service to ensure that children who may repeat their leaving certificate can be accommodated.  Children who pay for seats on school transport services who subsequently are not accommodated will receive a full refund.<\/p> <p>There is not any eligible child in Ireland who does not get school transport or a payment to help with transport to school.  The difficulty we have is with concessionary provision.  The scheme was laid out in the first place to deal with eligible children going to their nearest school.  The difficulty we have now is that we have almost 3,000 children availing of concessionary provision.  I always make the point that it is important to know that if a bus is coming from a village, town or city and is a 20-seater bus with 18 eligible children on it, we will facilitate two children under concessionary provision on that bus.  The difficulty is that if an eligible child from that village, town or place makes himself or herself available, we have no choice under legislation and criteria laid down to put that eligible child on the bus.<\/p> <p>I take on board what the Senator says in this regard and might speak to him further about it.  If he were to give me specific details, I would be delighted to talk to him and Bus &Eacute;ireann to address it.  My view has always been, and I have taken many questions on this, that if I had my way, I would try to facilitate as many children as possible but we are restricted under the scheme laid down under the value for money review put in place in 2011, backed by the D&aacute;il.  The system is excellent.  Some 99.9% of people are very happy with the system.

I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy John Paul Phelan, to the House.  I wish to raise a very important issue.  I ask for the Minister of State to consider whether local authority expenditure should be scrutinised by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I call for this in the context of a need for greater transparency in the governance and scrutiny of local government finance, and to reflect the financial stewardship that is placed on the whole corporate body of a local authority via its members.<\/p> <p>The members of a local authority have a particular role in scrutiny and accountability through the auditing process of local authorities.  This does not just concern the executive of the 31 local authorities in this country.  It is also about the role of the elected members and the oversight they provide.  Five years ago, the Minister of State's constituency colleague, Deputy John McGuinness of Fianna F&aacute;il, introduced a Bill to the D&aacute;il to make the expenditure and income of local authorities accountable to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts.  That Bill was rejected at Second Stage and therefore fell.  In 2012, the then Minister of State outlined the reasons why the Government objected to the Bill.  I do not intend to go into them now as he will be fully aware of them.  However, a lot has changed since 2012.  We now have the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, supervising local government.  We also have local property tax, a new dimension to local government revenue and expenditure which was not envisaged when this Bill was considered, or when the previous unsuccessful Bill addressed the matter.  I do not propose to go into the rights and wrongs of how the local property tax is disbursed across this country.  That is for another day and another debate, although I would welcome the House holding that debate at some stage.<\/p> <p>Now more than ever, however, people have a right to know how their local property tax and, indirectly, their income tax, is being spent by local authorities across this country.  As credible as the National Oversight and Audit Commission is, and with all respect to the good work that it does, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, will be aware that its reports do not come under the level of national scrutiny that the Committee of Public Accounts would bring to this work.  At a practical level, it is simple fact that Government expenditure comes under the spotlight of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The national media pay attention to the work of that committee, as we have seen time and time again.  Where there is a focus within this committee the media take an interest, and therefore the public hears about it.  That very important fact is worth taking into consideration as part of this recommendation.  I am not saying that there are wholesale inefficiencies or bad spending decisions taking place in local authorities.  I want to make that clear.

The whole area of local government and local government expenditure was covered, as the Senator mentioned, by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, which established the National Oversight and Audit Committee. The matter of examining how local authorities expend their resources and the value for money delivered for rate-payers and taxpayers across the country is a very significant issue, and the Senator is right to raise it.  The 2014 Act seems to have left a gap between the work that NOAC does and any measurable outcome at parliamentary level.  In theory at least, the reports that NOAC produces can be covered by the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, but in practice the housing aspect of that committee's remit is by far and away the busiest, and the local government reports do not seem to get as much coverage.  Shortly after I was appointed I attended a meeting with NOAC when I heard one was taking place in the Customs House.  I was the first Minister of State to go to one of their meetings.  I was impressed by the personnel involved.  They included former long-serving councillors and also long-serving management officials from across the country.  These were people who had a very serious interest in the area as well as a significant level of expertise. <\/p> <p>I am more than interested, I am in fact determined to ensure that the gap that exists at present between the activities of NOAC and those of the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government can be bridged in some way.  As things stand, there will be a local government Bill next year.  It is my intention that there will be provision in that Bill for strengthening the oversight of expenditure within local authorities.  As NOAC is currently constituted, its functions include scrutiny of the performance of local authorities; support of best practice; overseeing implementation of national local government policy; and monitoring and evaluating implementation of corporate plans.  It generally operates through subgroups, including a financial performance subgroup, that oversee different aspects of its work.  Each subgroup consists of three or four members out of the ten members of NOAC, and publishes annual local authority performance indicators and composite public spending code quality assurance reports.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->NOAC generally operates through subgroups, including a financial performance subgroup that has been set up to oversee different aspects of NOAC's work.  Each subgroup comprises three or four members from NOAC's total membership of ten people.  Each year, NOAC publishes local authority performance indicators and composite public spending code quality assurance reports.<\/p><p>I was interested to hear what the Senator had to say at the outset about the interest taken by the media in the activities of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The perception and the work of that committee have changed greatly in the past ten years.  It has become a very political committee.  It was not as political in the past.  This change has positive and negative aspects.  I am not convinced that adding local authority responsibility to the areas the committee has to examine is necessarily the right way to go.  I think we should try to make the NOAC system work more properly and fully than it does at present.<\/p><p>It is worth pointing out that when the reform legislation was being drafted and considered in the Oireachtas, consideration was given to the possibility of merging the Local Government Audit Service, which audits the 31 existing local authorities, and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  While it was decided at the time not to merge the two organisations, the process led to engagement between senior managers in the two auditing bodies on enhanced co-operation arrangements in areas like professional training, value for money methodologies and approaches, and the possibility of issuing joint reports within their existing respective mandates.<\/p><p>The possibility of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts having a role in further ensuring appropriate oversight of expenditure of public funds by local authorities can be reconsidered by the Oireachtas with particular regard to commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  At present, my priority is to finalise the reports on local government which are promised under the programme for Government.  At that stage, I will examine the matters that are to be addressed in the legislation that is to be introduced next year.  Clearly, most of that legislation will flow from the reform reports.  I am personally committed to the idea of greater national scrutiny and oversight of the finances expended by local authorities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#D00500","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his considered response.

The chief executives tend to reply to the service by noting the shortcomings that are highlighted in the reports and explaining that the financial structures of the local authorities do not have the necessary resources to carry out the extensive requests.  I suggest that the officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government who look at the annual local government audit reports every year need to say that this excuse is not good enough.

When we reflect on the possibility of providing for executive chairs of councils, we must consider whether that can happen right across the country, the timeframe for doing this and period of time for which they would remain in office.  I have been an advocate of this approach for a long time.  There are examples across the country of local authorities where the balance of power does not seem to work properly.  As we all know, elected members are held accountable whenever there is an election.  There is certainly a need for greater accountability at senior management level in our local authorities.

To date, the discussions have focused mainly on the Border, how much the United Kingdom owes the European Union, what will happen to EU citizens living in the United Kingdom and to UK citizens living in the European Union, the future trading relationship and the Single Market and the transition period.  Thankfully, on 8 December there was a breakthrough deal on the Border thanks to the hard work of our Ministers and the perseverance of civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is to be hoped the agreement and the heads of terms outlined in it will become a legally binding document without dilution in the weeks to come.<\/p> <p>As the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, said last week, the first phase was the easy part.  Those who say the key issues have been settled definitively are clearly fooling themselves.  I have a number of very specific points on which I seek clarification from the Government.  Will it explain exactly what is the definition of a frictionless Border?  It obviously involves no physical barriers, but is the Government stating it will also involve no payments or trade costs?  What differences are anticipated in the current cross-Border arrangements and what changes would be acceptable to people on both sides of the Border and the Government?  We know that the objective is for there to be no change.  However, if there is to be a change, how much of this fits within the Government's understanding of what is acceptable?  Would a Canada-plus type deal be acceptable, as proposed by the British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Mr. David Davis?  Unfortunately, it is now beyond doubt from statements made that there are profoundly different views on what the agreement involves, its status and implications.  The commitment to having an open border is contradicted by statements the United Kingdom as a whole will leave the customs union and the Single Market.  In the case of Ireland, the agreement states regulatory alignment will be maintained if there is no overall deal.  If there is no overall deal, the United Kingdom's membership of both the customs union and the Single Market will automatically lapse.

The thought struck me a few days ago that 25 years ago I was a teacher in a secondary school in Galway when I was on twice the starting salary teachers are on today.

There is something wrong if we cannot attract nurses who were trained in Ireland.  They are going abroad to work and they are not coming back.  Others are not going into the profession.

It has clearly been discriminated against for years.<\/p> <p>What happens as a result of this discrimination?  Again and again, we have the highest numbers of patients, many of whom are elderly people, on trolleys every day because of the over-crowding in the hospital.  The doctors and nurses are under ferocious pressure.  When people get into the system, they praise the doctors and nurses but they are under ferocious pressure.

I welcome the Minister's decision to give medical cards to carers, who do invaluable work and go to great lengths to support the ones they love and keep them at home.  I hope that he will also put the resources in place to allow doctors to do that work.  I have encountered more doctors closing their lists because of the workload.  They cannot cope.

The Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Regina Doherty, are working on this matter, but I encourage them to expedite their work and rectify this injustice as quickly as possible in the new year.

Judging from the television this morning, it will be a difficult Christmas for people who lost family members in that terrible fire in London.  It has been six months since the fire in Grenfell Tower.  We remember our own people who were lost in the Stardust fire.  Those families have never got over the loss of their children.  They raise the matter constantly, and rightly so.<\/p> <p>I have sought answers on the issue I am raising this morning.  Since the terrible fire in London, the London fire brigade has changed how it deals with high-rise fires.  When I say \"high-rise\", people think of large towers, but they are not.  They are six storeys and above.  There are many such buildings across the country.<\/p> <p>Prior to the Grenfell fire, London fire brigade would send four fire appliances and one high-reach vehicle.  In the six months since, it has changed that complement to five appliances and one high-reach vehicle.  Why are we only sending three fire appliances and one high-reach vehicle?  Following the Grenfell Tower fire, the London fire brigade has ordered new high-reach appliances, which are necessary when one is going above six storeys.  There are only three aerial appliances in Dublin, all of which are second-hand and spend more time out of service than in service.<\/p> <p>After the fire in London, we carried out a survey in Ireland and found 262 multi-storey buildings with questionable cladding.  I have asked a question time and again but have not got an answer - is there a register in each fire brigade station of these buildings' locations?  Do our first responders know what they are walking into when the bell rings and they set out in their fire appliances?  They could arrive at one of these buildings with questionable cladding that transfers fire rapidly through the building.  We would be sending our first responders into those buildings.<\/p> <p>When I raised this matter previously, I got no answers.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, told me that he would contact his officials and revert to me.  I only raised this matter to prevent a tragedy like the one in London from happening in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway.  We need action, and I want answers as quickly as possible.  I do not want to drag the Minister of State into the House.  If we could just get some answers to the questions we raise in this Chamber, it would be helpful.  If the Minister of State is not prepared to forward answers, there is no option but to ask him to return to the House, which I will do early in the new year if I do not get those answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#K00500","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for her passionate intervention on the drugs issue.

My party would call on the Government to move quickly.  We would hope that no political party, regardless of its reservations, would stop the people from having a say on this.  We have had the Citizens' Assembly and now the deliberations of the joint committee.  We need a referendum now.  I would hope that no party in the Oireachtas would stop that from happening.<\/p> <p>I would also make a call in regard to the campaign - many of us are anxious as to the tone of it - that on this occasion the erection of posters is something that might be reconsidered on both sides.  If we are to have a calm debate, if we are to have something that people can reflect on and analyse, the sloganeering and images that could potentially be erected on posters around the country is something that could be re-examined as to its appropriateness in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#L01900","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#L02000","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank all the staff and all those who work in the background in this House for their help and support throughout the past 12 months.

However, I still maintain that we need to do a lot of long term planning on this issue.  While the additional funding is helpful, it will not sort out the problem.  It is an area that needs serious attention and a plan for the next three to four years.

There is a role here for the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, chaired by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, in terms of doing some work in this area.  Senator Ruane is right that we need to have a proper dialogue on this issue and how we address it.  It is something that the aforementioned committee should look at in the new year.  The committee has done great work on issues like the national anthem, farm safety and so on.  One can see results from the work of that committee, as with the mental health report that was done recently.  I urge the Leas-Chathaoirleach to put this on the committee's agenda.  Perhaps he will consult Senator Ruane and others in terms of the approach that could be taken.  Big issues like this must be dealt with, head on.

It is important that we consider the future shape of Europe and that we recognise that as a nation we have a fundamental role to play in shaping the future of the EU.  Equally, as the Government has said, this is about ensuring that the island of Ireland is represented at the table and we must acknowledge the work done by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Helen McEntee in that regard.  At its meeting on Tuesday last the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, recommended that Seanad &Eacute;ireann continues with the work of the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

We have had positive conversations with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection about that.  I came away from the meeting with the Minister feeling encouraged that she not only understands the issue but wants to take charge and consider how we can improve the system for mothers.  I thank her for taking up that brief so soon and for really paying attention to the plight of single mothers.<\/p> <p>This amendment is born of years of experience within my community and in my work of women having to take the responsibility for sourcing maintenance from fathers with the father floating around, never receiving a letter or any communication from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or other areas forcing him to pay the maintenance.  It is an unfair burden on the mother who is already raising her child alone, trying to make ends meet and do all the normal things that mothers do, such as deal with health care and school appointments, and everything that goes with the role.  It is an unfair and unequal system that expects a mother to pursue the maintenance.  My research into legislating for this area began two years ago and when I examined it I found it was a minefield because in addition to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it is in the courts system and the Department of Justice and Equality has a role in how the courts proceed and deal with maintenance.  I wanted to get a report on how to marry those areas so that they work together to advance child maintenance.  England was my first port of call.  There was an okay system there at first but it then moved it to a privatised one.  That was worrying.  When it was first set up it was government run.  Now it is semi-privatised which worries me because the client must pay the maintenance recovery unit to seek out the maintenance.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The client then has to pay the recovery maintenance unit to seek the payment of maintenance which is not ideal for some, although I could be wrong about how the system works.  The mother should be removed completely if she cannot access maintenance naturally from the father.  If he does not offer her the money, she should not be forced to pursue him for it.  There are many situations, but this is not ideal across the board, even if the relationship between the parents is healthy.  It will have a negative impact on the rearing of the children if the parents are fighting constantly about the payment of maintenance.  I ask the Department to consider laying before the House a report on how we can address this issue.  It would have benefits overall, not only for the mother but also for the State because the more the father has to contribute in the rearing of his children, the less the State will have to intervene in the process.  It could, therefore, have a positive outcome overall for the mother and the children but also for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the provision of welfare grants and all that is available in that regard.<\/p><p>I will not press the amendment to a vote, but I ask the Minister to accept it and prepare a report on the matter.  I am interested in hearing what she has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#O01600","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the Senator for not pressing the amendment because I cannot accept it, not because I disagree with anything she has said because I do not, as she knows, but because I do not have the responsibility, although I wish I did, to establish a maintenance recovery section because that matter falls within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  However, that is not to say I cannot do anything.  I have a habit of sticking my nose in where it is probably not wanted.  What I can do in my area is, as I said, establish a committee after Christmas to look at what we do within the Department.  The Senator and any other Member interested is welcome to sit on that committee.<\/p> <p>I really question the policy and hope that shows my intent because, if I am questioning it, I am obviously proposing to change it, if and when I can do so.  I do not think it is right to ask any parent who has the responsibility to rear a child to chase an errant parent who has not meet their responsibilities in the first instance.  The Senator and I both know that, in most instances, it is the man who is the errant parent, but, in many cases, it is not.  <\/p> <p>I want to look at the way in which we operate the one-parent family payment system which should be completely separate from the responsibility of a parent to chase the errant parent.  This happens for many reasons.  In many cases, it may be a question of control and manipulation, but, even at the very happy end of the scale where there are no big issues, the system still puts the onus and an added burden on the parent who is rearing the children and doing everything in meeting school and dentist costs and so on.  We will establish the committee with a view to ascertaining very quickly what changes need to be made within the Department.  I will be making the changes for the payments recovered by the maintenance recovery section.  That is not to say, however, that we will have a maintenance recovery section in our division, but it will focus on the errant parent as opposed to the parent who is rearing the children.  If we can do what the Senator wants us to do within the division, I will have responsibility for it and will pursue the matter.  However, all of the other services available in the civil courts to those pursuing a partner for maintenance come under the Department of Justice and Equality.  Whether it be the family mediation service or the Legal Aid Board, they come within the remit of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  If we were to have a national maintenance recovery agency, the most likely place for it to be located would within his remit.  Because the responsibilities of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, span the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Justice and Equality, we will have an official to sit on our committee.  Let us see if we can explore the issue.  I am very happy to work with anybody, but what I cannot do is take responsibility for preparing a report that would not be within my remit.  However, I can give my word that, within my Department, we will establish a committee to look at what we do from a one-parent family payment perspective and also at what is available in the maintenance recovery section.  Perhaps we are focused on the wrong parent and that we need to realign.  If that is what we decide to do, it is something we could do very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#P00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I welcome all of the Minister's comments.

Unfortunately, I was not able to stay until the end of the Second Stage debate on Tuesday but I read the record and I agree with something the Minister of State said.  I commend him on the achievement of unwinding the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation in an orderly and controlled manner.  Considering the context in which FEMPI was passed and the progress that has been made since that time, it is something to take a moment to consider and I commend the Minister of State and the Department on this.<\/p> <p>That being said, I want to signal my opposition to section 22.  The section suspends the awarding of increments to trade unions that have not signed up to the public service stability agreement and it ensures they will not receive any benefits of the agreement between 2018 and 2021.  It deliberately penalises public servants not covered by the public service stability agreement with slower pay restoration, suspends incremental increases until 2021 and implements a lower entry threshold for additional superannuation contributions until 2021 compared with public servants whose unions did sign up.<\/p> <p>This legislation will entrench and support discrimination by the State between cohorts of its own public servants based on their union membership.  The Government will essentially reward public servants and unions that agree with it and sharply penalise those public servants and unions that do not.  The unions that perhaps rejected this deal based on solidarity with members who are not given full pay restoration have now been punished.  It sets a dangerous precedent and is an attempt to bulldoze opposition by offering incentives to those who subsequently sign up to the agreement via the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#Q01600","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I meant to say at the outset that, with the permission of the House, I want to clarify something.  I wish to correct the record of the House on a technical matter.  In Tuesday's speech I referred to the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill as a money Bill.  The Bills Office has since confirmed this is not technically correct.  While a money message in respect of the imposition of a charge on public moneys and a financial resolution in respect of the imposition of a charge on the people were required for the Bill, it does not meet the technical definition of a money Bill.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge and appreciate what the Senator has said on what we want to do.  As I said in the other House and here the other night, none of us has a monopoly when it comes to the concern we have for the unwinding of FEMPI.  It was an instrument at the time that had to be used in a fairly drastic situation.  It is about affordability and order.  We want to do both together and, as I said on Second Stage, we are committed as a Government to making sure it is done and we are committed to working with the trade union movement and its representatives through the structures of the agreement.<\/p> <p>As I said to Senator Burke earlier, it is the ambition of the Government that everybody would be covered by this.  We do not want to see a situation where anybody is outside but, by the same token, if we go back to 1987 when we had the Programme for Economic and Social Progress talks and all of the collective agreements that came out of it, it is an agreement between the trade union movement and its public services committee and the Government.  We hope everybody will be able to avail of it.  We do not want anybody to feel he or she cannot be part of this.  At the same time, we have to acknowledge the vast majority of public servants in the State have voted to accept it.  Even within those unions which have not voted to accept it, there are large groups that have voted to accept it.  It is a reflection of the democratic process at play within the workplace.<\/p> <p>As I said to Senator Burke, we have a sincere ambition that, ultimately, everybody will be covered by the scope of the agreement, and what the legislation simply does is to reiterate the fact it is an agreement.  There are those who agreed and there are those who did not agree, but we hope as a Government that everybody will accept the will of the majority, a very clear majority in this case, and that we get to a situation where from 1 January we are able to reward everybody.  This is our mission and this is what we want to do.  We want to be in a situation, with the amount of money we have and all of the competing resources and demands, to get rid of this legislation.  Nobody wants to see it continuing to be around, but we have to do it in an orderly way and it has to be by agreement.

As the Minister of State is aware, teachers who entered the profession after 2010 have experienced a significant pay differential compared with their longer serving colleagues, despite doing the same work.

I, therefore, propose with this amendment that the Government be fully informed on its decision not to remove the pay differential.  I am not saying that the Government has to remove it but I want the Minister and his Department to be fully cognisant of the impact it has had and continues to have on the quality of life of new entrant teachers, staff retention in the sector and intergenerational morale and satisfaction between teachers on both scales.  The Government is fully entitled to make fiscal decisions based on the funding available to it.  What I propose with this amendment is that the Government prepares a report to fully examine the impact of the decision.  Opposition to this amendment would simply indicate to me that the Government is not interested in confronting the tough reality of the impact of the decision not to end the pay differential among our teachers.

I would point out to the Minister of State that in an extraordinary move, the late Brian Lenihan removed, with the stroke of a pen, the long service increment attaching to Members of this House.

One of the main allowances is for hiring public relations companies and for expense account lunches.  What could be more corrupt than that?<\/p> <p>I used to use some of my allowances to publish a newsletter.  On one of the allowances a newsletter could not be published.  My secretary rang and said that it is intended to be for the preparation, publication and distribution of things like newsletters but she was told they would not pay for the postage.

As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, said on this matter in the other House, if we did not have the measures that are contained in the Bill for those who are covered and not, we would not have an agreement to present.  Everybody will benefit from the Bill, some in a different timeframe from others, but we would hope that everybody would be in the same timeframe.  That is what the Minister has committed to.  In response to Senator Ruane, that is why there is the working group within the confines of the public service agreement, under the stewardship of the public service committee and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, which is committed to having honest and continuing dialogue on the end of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI.

The section imposes differential pension payment rates for those not signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement, PSSA.  Those covered public servants have an exemption threshold of &euro;34,500 before they must make pension contributions.  Workers who did not support the PSSA are on the threshold of &euro;28,750.

The approach in the Bill to pay restoration has union membership at its core.  It entrenches different treatment by the State of public servants, almost entirely on the union to which they pay their dues.  If the State is to pursue this as Government policy, it has a responsibility to be fully aware of the impact on our trade unions.  If we accept that trade unions provide an important public good in allowing for collective bargaining and better labour standards for all workers, the Government needs to monitor the impact of its policy on this crucial sector of society.  <\/p><p>There is a concern that the way pay restoration is structured in the legislation will assert pressure on those workers whose unions have not signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement to end their union membership in order to notify the Workplace Relations Commission that they agree to be bound by the agreement.  Therefore, a direct impact of Government policy could be to contribute to the breaking up of trade unions and a damaging of the ability of workers in this country to bargain collectively.<\/p><p>If that is the case, my amendment would be a crucial addition to the Bill.  We need to know the scale of the problem and its impact on union membership.  This is provided for in paragraph (a).  If we agree that this Bill could have a negative impact on union membership, the Government should examine options on how such membership could be supported by the State in recognition of the public good derived from trade unions.  The Government should consider drafting legislation in support of measures that support trade unions as well as the reintroduction of tax reliefs.  I am not proposing to put into the legislation that these things need to happen.  However, the Government should be informed of the impact of its decisions and options on how conditions could be improved.  Opposition would indicate to me that the Government is not interested in tracking the consequences of its actions.

First, it presupposes that there will be people who are outside the agreement but, as I have already said, we hope everyone will be covered by it.  Further, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform engages with the Workplace Relations Commission and all of the bodies established under statute, not to mention the fact that an oversight body is included in the agreement.  As late as the week before last, the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I met representatives of the public service committee of the trade union movement.  The Minister has active engagement on a continuous basis with them.  It has to be acknowledged, and I would like to acknowledge it at this stage, that the work the Minister and the officials in the Department have done in the run-up to this agreement, against the backdrop of what was a fairly difficult set of negotiations, proves beyond any doubt, and all political parties since 1987 can take some credit for it, that there is active and ongoing engagement by Government through the departmental councils and the general council as well as the conciliation and arbitration scheme and all the other schemes and machinery of the State, whether industrial relations machinery or otherwise.  Some of it is legislated for and some happens on an informal basis.  However, there is no attempt by any stretch of the imagination on the part of the those of us in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to do anything other than engage actively and collaboratively with the trade union movement.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, the prize has been, is and, it is hoped, will continue to be industrial peace and the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation.  I am a former member of the INTO.  Although I am not teaching at the moment, if at some stage the electorate decides to return me to that profession, I would hope to renew my membership of the INTO.  I hope the general secretary and my colleagues in the teaching profession will have me back.  I also hope that it would not be as soon as some people might like.<\/p> <p>I appreciate the Senator's sentiments but it is a matter for the unions to maintain their membership and encourage people to join them.  The Government is bound by legislation and the Constitution to ensure it engages with members of unions.  Nowhere in the legislation does it suggest anything other than continued engagement between Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in the person of the Minister, and the trade unions.  The Minister's bona fides are well established given the number of meetings held and the level of interaction he has had and plans to have from January onwards once the Bill is enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#W00300","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I accept most of what the Minister of State has said, especially that relating to the Department's intentions.

However, as has been said previously, the provisions of the Bill require most detailed scrutiny to ensure consistency with the property rights and safeguards in the Constitution, with particular reference to Article 40.3 and Article 43.  I am sure Senators will appreciate the importance of ensuring coherence with other statutory provisions governing the purchase of ground rents.<\/p> <p>Senators will appreciate this is a complex area of law.  As indicated previously, it is already clear that amendments to the Bill will be required to minimise the risk of further challenges on constitutional grounds.  In these circumstances, I have agreed with the Attorney General to establish a small expert group comprising senior officials from the Department and representatives from the Office of the Attorney General together with a number of outside experts in the area of land law.  It is important that they consider the issues at hand and report on the amendments necessitated by the Supreme Court ruling in the Shirley case.  While it is not possible to set a deadline for the group to complete its task at this early stage, it is my hope and intention that a substantial amount of the group's work will have been completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018.  I expect, therefore, that the group's conclusions and recommendations will provide a sound basis for future amendments to ground rents legislation.<\/p> <p>Members will be aware the issue of ground rents has been something of a complex conveyancing matter going right back to the foundation of the State.  Many of the pieces of legislation since then, and I refer specifically to the 1978 Acts, are complex and detailed and need to be looked at in the context of the Constitution.  I ask Senators to bear with the committee to ensure we do what Senators Gallagher, Ardagh and Swanick, who are promoting the Bill, wish to do.  I support their endeavours in this regard.<\/p> <p>There is agreement in the House that we need to address this issue.  What we have not finally established with certainty is the means by which this issue can be addressed.  I acknowledge the importance of this legislation.

I heartily congratulate my constituency colleague, Senator Gallagher, on bringing forward this legislation and so competently and ably presenting it to the House and securing its passage.  That takes a combination of good advocacy, good networking and good presentation.  I commend Senator Gallagher on doing that with great effect.  Before I refer to the content of the Bill, I join Senator Gallagher in welcoming the people from Carrickmacross to the Gallery, led by the distinguished former Ceann Comhairle, my own good personal friend, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon.  I am glad to see them all in the Gallery and welcome them.  It is important to the people of Carrickmacross from the Shirley Estate.<\/p> <p>The Bill does not need to be debated again nor am I suggesting that happen.  Its object and logic are that people should be fit to buy out their freeholds.  In other words, they should be able to buy the freehold of their estates and not go on being subject to ground rent and possible vagaries, changes and future increases in that ground rent.  It is a reasonable proposition that they should have security of tenure and freehold and not be subject to changing ground rents in the future.  I am delighted to support the Bill on behalf of my group, to commend it to further Stages and urge the Minister to bring it to fruition as quickly as possible since it is in the interests of the people in the area of Carrickmacross and those affected by this nationally.

It is in our hearts.  It is not just the past history of centuries of landlords but it continues today and will affect our lives tomorrow.  Michael Davitt was guided by the motto, \"Let justice be done tho the heavens fall.\"  I doubt he would be impressed by the propensity of successive Governments to prostrate themselves in the interests of unfettered landlordism.  It is time to take up Davitt's fight again and ensure that justice is done.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports this legislation.  I remember my parents marching in Dublin in the 1970s due to the unfair charges that one had to pay even though one was purchasing one's home and which are still there on my family home today.  I am not paying them and do not ever intend to.  I pay tribute to the work of Shirley Tenants Action Group in Carrickmacross which has been active on the issue.  The initial case taken by Gus O'Gorman many years ago highlighted the need for legislation since 1978.  Such legislation was promised in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party manifesto since then.  My colleague, Teachta Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, has consistently asked, almost since entering the D&aacute;il in 1997, when legislation will be published.<\/p> <p>It is hard to believe the economic development of part of Carrickmacross is being held up by an absentee landlord who is currently basking on the Isle of Man.  I hope this Bill proceeds through the D&aacute;il and succeeds in highlighting the vulnerable nature of tenancy in general.  Ground rent landlords demand money for nothing.  They possess parasitic traits, exploiting ordinary working people and their day is done.  I would like this Bill to enshrine that in legislation.  I welcome the Bill from Fianna F&aacute;il which sets it against aggressive landlordism.  I am sure thousands of people across Dublin and the State will be pleased to see this change in attitude by the junior Government partner.  We will wait and see and I guess time will tell, but well done on bringing the Bill to fruition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121400002#KK00600","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1513247400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the contribution of Senators to this important legislation.  I had not noticed my former colleague and friend, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, in the Public Gallery until reference was made by a previous speaker but I will avail of this opportunity to welcome back Dr. O'Hanlon to Leinster House.  I acknowledge his great contribution over many years.  In particular, I recall his positive and constructive work on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  He was one of the founding fathers of what was the basis of a strong and active relationship between Parliament in Westminster and Parliament in Dublin.  I believe those strong links are now needed perhaps more than ever.

On behalf of the Government, I accept the message from the Seanad that there is all-party support for setting about enshrining in law the right of ground rent tenants to purchase their ground rents in properties, albeit in different circumstances throughout the country.  There are no immediate or simple solutions in this complex area.  I acknowledge the support of the Government for the approach I am taking.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has expressed a particularly keen interest in this matter since the spring of 2012, when the Supreme Court delivered a judgment in a complex and protracted set of legal proceedings arising from an application to acquire freehold title in Carrickmacross.  While the tenant's application in this case was ultimately successful, it is important to stress that the manner in which the Supreme Court interpreted certain technical provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 had the effect of narrowing the scope of the ground rent purchase scheme under that Act.  As a result of the Supreme Court ruling, certain ground rent tenants who had been eligible to acquire the fee simple interest, or freehold title, in their properties may no longer be able to do so.  This has given rise to uncertainty and concern.  Any narrowing of the grounds on which a ground rent tenant is permitted to acquire freehold title will affect other ground rent tenants in Carrickmacross and elsewhere in the State.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the contributions of Senators to this debate.  The property rights enshrined in the Constitution mean that a resolution of this issue will be neither straightforward nor simple.  I acknowledge the support of Senators for my proposal to establish an expert group.  I will be happy to keep the proposers of the Bill fully informed on the work of the expert group.  I hope to be in a position to return to the Oireachtas in the spring with a framework arrangement that will allow us to proceed further.  I would like to express my appreciation to the proposers of the Bill.  I have received all-party support from Senator O'Reilly and Senators from other parties.
