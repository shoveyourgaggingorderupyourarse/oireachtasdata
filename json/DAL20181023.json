We learned today that more than 6,000 people who are waiting for elderly care services could be waiting for up to two years.  These are just a number of the issues, all of which have been impacted by the chronic crisis in recruiting and retaining qualified consultants.  There are 3,176 approved consultant posts in our health service but as only 2,713 have been filled, there are about 463 unfilled qualified consultant posts.  Our accident and emergency departments are left without specialist qualified consultants on too regular a basis and there is a chronic shortage across the board in psychiatry across the country.  There are other examples.  In effect, the shortage of qualified consultants is impacting on the quality and timeliness of care for many patients throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  There is general agreement that the cuts to new entrant consultant salaries, particularly those introduced in October 2012, constitute the key factor in this chronic inability to attract and recruit consultants to the Irish health service.  A cut of up to 30% was introduced in October 2012.  This pay differential is a major inhibitor in terms of recruiting qualified consultants.  We have an unprecedented number of unfilled permanent posts as a result of that, which is clearly undermining the quality and provision of essential care to patients across the acute hospital service.  <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has confirmed the difficulty in recruiting consultants.  <\/p><p>Everybody seems to have identified the pay differential between consultants recruited post 2012 and their colleagues recruited before that.  The differential which can be up to 57% is the major factor.  When we add the fact that we have 40% fewer consultants than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average we see the impact on the hospital services.  For example, in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, there are 6,500 new patients waiting to see a consultant urologist.  St. James's Hospital has advertised twice and has failed to recruit a consultant.  In Cork, approximately 6,000 patients are awaiting outpatient reviews for eye surgery.  In a recent survey by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, of 300 recently appointed consultants, post-2012, 70% are seriously considering resigning from their public hospital posts unless the discrimination against them ends.  Does the Taoiseach accept that we have a very serious issue in recruiting qualified consultants to the health service?  Does he accept that the post-2012 pay differential is a key factor and does he accept this is having an impact on patient care adding to waiting lists and undermining overall quality and what does he propose to do about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540299900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Government appreciates and understands that we have enormous challenges in our health service particularly when it comes to access, overcrowding in our emergency departments, the fact that many patients have to wait far too long to see a specialist or far too long for the operation or procedure they need.<\/p>  <p>  There are other truths as well.  When we ask 14,000 of our patients, as we do every year, how they rate their experience of our health service, 85% of public patients say they rate our public health service highly, that their experience is good or very good or even excellent.  When it comes to patient outcomes, for example, we see big improvements in survival rates for cancer, heart attack and stroke over the past five to ten years happening because of new technology and the hard work of our front-line staff and Government investment and policies behind them.  For example, on the issue of overcrowding, today 297 patients await a hospital bed.  That is down 24% on this day last year and down 20% on the same day two years ago.

People now wait on average fewer than six months for an operation or procedure that they need.  There are 50,000 waiting more than three months, most people wait fewer than six months for an operation or procedure.  For example, at the end of July 2017, there were almost 8,000 patients waiting more than three months for cataract procedures.  That number is down to 4,000.  We all get lots of queries about hips and knees.  The number waiting more than three months in July 2017 was 2,400.  That is down to 1,717.  Similarly, there were 2,600 people waiting for tonsil procedures during the summer of 2017.  That is down to 1,150.

The Government accepts we have a problem in recruiting and retaining consultants in our public hospital system.  What is being done about it?  We have a three-year pay agreement, which involves pay increases and pay restoration for consultants, including two pay increases next year and an increment.  We have negotiated with ICTU an arrangement for new entrants recruited after 2011-12 to equalise the pay scales.  It does not do that fully for consultants, but it goes a considerable way towards that.  There will be two pay increases, pay restoration, an increment, as well as special measures for new entrants, all happening next year.  Those pay increases take a big chunk out of that extra &euro;1 billion for healthcare next year.  We need to ensure we do not allow all the money go into extra pay and pay rises.  We also need to ensure there is money for new services, new drugs, new equipment and new buildings.<\/p>  <p>  We accept the Public Service Pay Commission report, which I have read as have the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.

I offer sympathy to the Taoiseach and his party colleagues.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p>  <p>  This morning, Care Alliance Ireland published a report on the provision and shortcomings of public provision of home care.  Its findings are stark and they highlight a shocking reality facing thousands of our most vulnerable citizens in need of care and support.<\/p>  <p>  The report finds that more than 6,000 people are on waiting lists for home-care packages, a finding that was also communicated to my party colleague, An Teachta O'Reilly, in which the HSE acknowledged to her that the number of people waiting for home-care support stands at 6,118.  The report states that people are waiting for up to two years in some cases for home-care support and that the average waiting time in one HSE area is six to nine months.  <\/p>  <p>  The report also estimates that there is an 18% gap across the board between the number of care hours being provided and those required.  In one HSE area only 60% of hours requested are being provided.  The figures are absolutely shocking.  They are shocking because services have been cut and they remain underfunded.<\/p>  <p>  The report finds that there was a reduction in services between 2009 and 2012 and, most acutely, between 2011 and 2012, under a Fine Gael and Labour Government when there was a reduction of 1.5 million home-care hours.<\/p><p>Despite the service remaining underfunded, no additional resources were allocated for home care supports in next year's budget.  That illustrates a complete disregard for the value of home care.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, it is one of the most important services provided within the public system.  Care delivered in the home is the preferred form of care for most people and their families, particularly older people.  The vast majority of older citizens want to live independently and comfortably in their own home for as long as possible.  Home care packages are also vital for many with a disability or in medical need.<\/p> <p> Providing these packages makes absolute sense socially, but also economically.  It saves the State money and frees up resources.  Failure to provide adequate care through these packages leaves people stuck in hospitals or forced into residential facilities when they could return home.  This has a knock-on effect, contributing to the trolley and waiting list crises in our hospitals as beds are occupied by those who want to, and who are ready to, return home but who are prevented from doing so.<\/p> <p> The HSE has said home support services must be delivered within the funding available.  The logical solution is to make more funding available.  Will the Taoiseach revisit his allocation of funding to provide for additional home care packages next year?  Will he, in line with the report's recommendations, move quickly to delivering a fairer, better home care support service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300005#C03100","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540301100,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her words of condolence to the family, friends, constituents and party of Seymour Crawford, who is being buried this afternoon in Monaghan.  I had the opportunity to visit the house yesterday.  Many of us served with Seymour for a period.  He truly was a wonderful public representative, a gentle giant and a good friend to many of us.  There will be an opportunity at a later date to pay tribute to him in a more substantial way.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to home care, the Government, HSE and health policy very much favour it.  It enables older people, but not just older people, to get out of hospital much quicker.  In many cases, good home care means they never have to go to hospital at all.  It also means people who need it, particularly elderly citizens, are able to spend much more time in their homes before they have to go into long-term residential care.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to 2011 and 2012.  I have no doubt she is correct in what she said in that regard but, of course, it is not 2011 or 2012; it is now 2018.  There has been a considerable increase in resources and funding for home care during the past three years.  In 2015, for example, the budget for home care was &euro;306 million.  This year it is &euro;420 million, representing an increase of more than 30% in the past three years alone.  An additional &euro;1 billion will be provided for health services next year.  That has not yet been allocated.  I am certain some of it will be allocated for extra home help and home care packages.  We need to make sure, however, that the &euro;1 billion gets to the patients.  We need to come together as a House and make sure it does not get lost in red tape and in meeting pay demands and other demands.  We must make sure it goes to the patients and is allocated for extra home help and home care packages, new medicines, new services and new equipment.  The big challenge we face collectively in this House over the next couple of months is making sure the &euro;1 billion, or as much of it as possible, gets to the patients, which means better care for them, including extra home help and extra home care packages.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the HSE service plan provided for 17 million home help hours.  This allocation provided home help to 50,500 people.  We acknowledge absolutely that there will be a need for additional resources next year; that is planned.  We acknowledge that there are inconsistencies in waiting times from one region to the next.  In some places, the waiting time is as little as 24 days while, in others, it is six to nine months, on average.  It is, of course, a policy dilemma.  When one allows for regional autonomy, there will be regional variation, but we need to bear that in mind.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare plan and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, we plan to develop a statutory scheme for home care, very much using the fair deal model.  People can now apply to the scheme for long-term care.  If they qualify for it, they will get long-term care in approximately four weeks but, because we do not have a statutory scheme of that kind for home care, some people may get home care within 24 days while others may have to wait for six to nine months.  We believe we now need to establish a statutory scheme for home care that is not the same as the fair deal scheme but that works on that model, which has proven to be a success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300006#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301700,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Before the Deputy responds, I wish to say ar l&aacute;mh deis D&eacute; at&aacute; anam Seymour Crawford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300007#E00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301700,"counter":48,"content":"<p>All of us are agreed on the necessity of home care packages, not only their social necessity but also their economic common sense.  That is not a matter of controversy.  The report is very clear and the figures are not wrong.  The 1.5 million hours cut from the system have not been fully replaced and there is a 16% deficit in the hours required.  The report also proposes how that might be funded, saying that somewhere north of an additional &euro;100 million must be dedicated to the service.  Will the Taoiseach do that?  I am sure he is familiar with this through his constituency work.  I have constituents who have a home care package that amounts to half an hour per day.

That means additional home care packages, new medicine, new equipment and new buildings.  I would welcome Sinn F&eacute;in's ideas as to how that &euro;1 billion should be broken down and spent.  It is not good enough for a serious Opposition party, certainly not one that wishes to be in government, to come here every week demanding more funding for all forms of health care and it all adding up to &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion.  There is only so much that can be dedicated to the health service next year.  There is an extra &euro;1 billion, which is a big increase.  I hope the Deputy shares my desire that priority be given to patients and that the money goes to patient care and additionality, not to paying more for the same.  More of the same is not the solution for our health service.  There has been an increase in spending on home care from &euro;306 million in 2015 to &euro;420 million, a massive increase of &euro;120 million in three years.

Significantly, I pose this question on the same day that we await the Taoiseach's decision on the mother and baby home in Tuam.  I sincerely hope he will decide on a full excavation and exhumation of the site with a view to maximum information being made available.  This is also the day we have learned, quite incredibly, that the Government has changed the application process for compensation for women who worked in Magdalen laundries.  It now requires them to specify the number of weekly hours worked, completely disregarding the spirit and content of the Quirke report.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, there is the case of Caranua and the rationale and content of its purpose.  It was established to provide support to people who experienced abuse in institutions as children.  In 2013, the chairwoman said there should be smooth and uncomplicated access to the fund.  The chief executive officer, CEO, said it was about putting survivors at the heart of the process.  It was always a defined group with a defined amount of money.  It was meant to be rolled out transparently and with minimum bureaucracy.  Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.  It is a classic example of the institution becoming more important than the people it was set up to serve.<\/p><p>Survivors have confirmed that its mode of delivery has added to their abuse.<br\/><br\/>Rather than rolling out a fair and transparent system based on a comprehensive plan the applicants have, at best, been subjected to an <i>ad hoc<\/i>, haphazard and unprofessional system which has succeeded in traumatising them again.  People have come to Deputies at the end of their tether.  Among the issues raised are the constant changing of personnel, no timely response on the phones, no timely response to letters and no giving of information relating to rights, especially the right of appeal.  In essence, there has been a recreation for the applicants of the abuse suffered in institutions.  Caranua is certainly misnamed.  Rather than being a new friend, it is the old friend, the seanchara, with an arbitrary use of power, which is perfectly encapsulated in the way in which the arbitrary limit of &euro;15,000 was brought in.  This was retrospective and left applicants in limbo with no knowledge as to their rights.  We now have an appeals system and I pay tribute to the appeals officers who have highlighted the concerns.  One appeals officer is working with a significant backlog.  Having recognised the need for it, will the Taoiseach confirm that he will immediately put in an additional appeals officer?  Will he examine what is happening on the ground and take a hands-on approach to stop injustice being repeated when it is unnecessary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300007#E00500","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540302000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>On the mother and baby home in Tuam, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, will make a statement at 3 p.m.  It is fair to say that the she has put an enormous amount of work into studying this matter over the past two years.  The Cabinet accepted her recommendations today.  I would like to give the Minister the opportunity to outline her recommendations in detail at 3 p.m. when she is able to do so.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Magdalen redress scheme, the Government's intention is to comply with and implement the Ombudsman's recommendations on the scheme, which is to extend the scheme to a wider group of women who did not live in the Magdalen laundries but who worked in them and lived in adjacent institutions.  In doing so, we operate as a Government in good faith, accepting the Ombudsman's recommendations and trying to implement them.  The scheme is, however, based on the amount of time a woman spent in the institution and the number of hours she worked there, so it is necessary to ask that question.  This is the way the scheme works; it is linked to the amount of time spent in the institution and the number of hours worked there.  This is how the financial award is calculated, which is the fairest way to do it.<\/p>  <p>  Caranua as a body has, at this stage, allocated over &euro;100 million to people who needed additional practical supports, often advice and counselling and in some cases assistance to modify their homes and with their healthcare.  Many of the people who received some of that &euro;100 million have put it to good use and it has helped them in their lives.

That concern is based on two issues: the question of ownership and the question of ethos.  On ownership, most people simply cannot fathom why the State would even contemplate gifting a valuable asset worth more than &euro;300 million to a private entity.  That must stop.  Does the Taoiseach agree?<\/p>  <p>  There is also grave concern, especially among women, about the fact that it is proposed to transfer ownership of the new national maternity hospital - and it will be called the National Maternity Hospital -  to a private religious entity, the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  It is wholly inappropriate that this should be the case in this day and age.  The fear, which is very well founded, is that women will be denied access to the full range of healthcare services provided for under the law.  We know that religious orders have a special place in the Constitution.  Under Article 44, a religious order can control what it owns.  When the Supreme Court has been asked to interpret this part of the Constitution it has always supported the right of the order to protect its own ethos.  We know that when it comes down to deciding the ethos of Elm Park the Constitution will have to prevail and the order will win out.  <\/p>  <p>  The Mulvey report was a brokered deal done behind closed doors between two private institutions, St. Vincent's and Holles Street, with no reference at all to the public interest but the Minister, Deputy Harris, continues to blindly maintain that the Mulvey report can provide a solution.  What is the status of this report now?  Surely it is redundant.  <\/p>  <p>  In May 2017, the Minister for Health asked for a month to get to grips with the crisis facing him.  He has now had 17 months and he has not managed to square this circle because it is simply not possible.  Can the Taoiseach now give an undertaking that the new national maternity hospital will be taken into public ownership as a condition of public funding; that the more than &euro;300 million which has been earmarked for the new build will be conditional on this change in ownership; and that the new national maternity hospital will be governed by a new secular charter which is fit for the 21st century?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300009#G00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1540302900,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to the national maternity hospital relocation project.  We want to see it go to tender, if not this year certainly next year and we want to see it go to construction next year.  It involves the development of a new maternity hospital on the campus of St. Vincent's at Elm Park and also improvements to that hospital.  The new hospital will be funded by the State and is included in Project Ireland 2040.  The hospital will have full operational and clinical independence.  We intend that it should apply the medical ethics of our State and our Republic and not those of any religious order.  The development will represent a flagship project of the national maternity strategy and will constitute the largest single investment ever made in maternity services in Ireland.  However, it is essential that the legal and governance arrangements associated with this very significant State investment are robust.  Considerable work is under way and has been undertaken to develop a legal framework for this project to protect the public's significant investment in the new hospital.  This legal framework will also underpin the operational and clinical independence of the new hospital from St. Vincent's.  Once finalised - and it has not been finalised yet - the proposals will be subject to consideration by the Government, the national maternity hospital itself and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  I assure the House that patient care in the new hospital will be delivered without religious, ethnic or other distinction and that any medical procedure which is in accordance with the laws of the land will be carried out there.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be said that the model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally.

Instead of seeing modern communications, what we are seeing is very traditional old-style marketing.  It may use new platforms but there is nothing modern about the focus on selling messages rather than engaging with citizens in a real way.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days, the Taoiseach has begun appearing in paid online advertisements on Brexit.  Could he tell us how many views he has bought for his video?  With the dramatic extension of policy advertising and the central role played by the Taoiseach and his Ministers, most modern communications companies would undertake a review of its effectiveness.  Can the Taoiseach state whether any studies have been commissioned on whether the politician-focused advertising on which the Government is spending millions of euro is effective?  Have we become a more creative society?  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, and the Taoiseach have been appearing regularly in paid advertisements in supplements telling us that creativity is great.  Creative Ireland is costing a lot of money and there have been many supplements and photographs.  I am not clear, however, about their impact.<\/p>  <p>  It is purported that the video produced for the UN Security Council campaign cost approximately &euro;100,000, and that &euro;370,000 was expended on it overall.  One hundred thousand euro was spent on a five-minute video, which seemed to be more about the domestic audience than the international audience.  We have won the campaign before.  On previous occasions, we have had people elected to the Security Council but it did not involve this sort of elaborate razzmatazz and videos of the Taoiseach and others with backdrops, music and all the rest of it.  That is all fine but people who know what Security Council elections are all about are aware it is about the hard grind of knocking on doors.  It takes a long time to make contacts, which are built up over a number of years.  Arrangements must be made with other countries and alliances have to be developed.  Therefore, I question the need for a video production costing &euro;100,000 for the campaign.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach indicated to me its purpose and audience.  The audience seems to be domestic rather than international.  Could the Taoiseach indicate whether he has undertaken any analyses or studies of the effectiveness of all this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300020#S00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1540308300,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I want to ask about the <i>gov.ie<\/i>portal project, on which the GIS has been working with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer to develop.

It might be a useful exercise.<\/p><p>Creative Ireland and the UN Security Council campaigns are not run out of my Department or funded by it.  With regard to the UN Security Council campaign more broadly, it obviously has different aspects.  There is traditional lobbying at diplomatic and political levels.  I used the Asia&ndash;Europe summit on Friday in Brussels as an opportunity to do that.  I met bilaterally, in a formal context, the President of Mongolia and the Prime Minister of Norway.  I also met the Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan and the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia.  I obviously had many other interactions on Thursday evening and Friday with many government representatives and world leaders.  I used the occasion as an opportunity to make our case and pitch for a seat on the UN Security Council.  Should I have the opportunity to continue in office between now and the election in 2020, that will be a big part of the work I do as Taoiseach.  Obviously it is happening all the time at diplomatic level.  Ministers are incorporating this work into their regular bilateral meetings.<\/p><p>Beyond diplomatic and political lobbying, there is, of course, what we actually do as a country, including the stance we take in the United Nations and the position we take on important issues.  As part of the budget last week, there was a very large increase in commitment to overseas development assistance.  I often hear political parties in this Chamber demanding that we increase our contribution to overseas development aid by a certain amount.  We exceeded any figure produced by any party in our commitment.  That now allows us to start moving up the scale again in terms of the proportion of our national income that is committed to overseas development aid.  We had been at about 0.5% at one stage but the figure fell to about 0.3%.  We are now going to start increasing the proportion again, however.  We have an ongoing commitment to peacekeeping.  We are increasing our level of participation in the mission in Lebanon, as the Deputy knows, taking the place of the Finns and Estonians, who are not continuing any more.  It is important to have a public-awareness aspect to the campaign informing the public about what the Government is doing and how its money is being spent, particularly when it relates to overseas development aid, peacekeeping and our work in the United Nations.  In addition, the Global Ireland 2025 initiative, to which I am very committed, is expanding our diplomatic presence around the world.  New embassies are being set up and we are expanding significantly the remit and operations of agencies such as IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia and InterTrade Ireland.  The Deputies will have seen in the budget a real, substantial commitment to all of those things.  This is a new approach to foreign policy that is bursting with substance, whether in respect of Global Ireland 2025 or our UN Security Council campaign.<\/p><p>With regard to <i>gov.ie<\/i>, I am not fully up to date on how the project is going.  The plan is that <i>gov.ie<\/i>will become the portal for access to all Departments and services.  To be honest, I am not quite sure how rapidly it is developing.  I believe it is run out of the Office of Government Procurement.  I am afraid I do not know the position on the health portal yet but I will certainly find out and advise the Deputy by correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300020#S00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Inquiries","time":1540308300,"counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300020#S00500"},{"type":"question","time":1540308300,"counter":186,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[37671\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300020#S00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has concerns regarding Government leaks, particularly regarding the Scally inquiry.

The Taoiseach knows, or it should be easy for him to determine, every person in the Government who had access to the report's findings.  It appears that it was in the Taoiseach's office and in the office of the Minister for Health.  The leaking of the report was unquestionably morally repugnant, given the significance of the issue involved.  As the Taoiseach said, it frustrated the objective in the first instance of meeting with the women who have been affected by this and briefing them on the content of the report.  It was also a clear breach of the confidentiality of Cabinet documents and official papers.<\/p> <p> Would it not have been preferable to bring in an outsider with the power and authority to get to the bottom of what was a callous and cynical attempt at media manipulation?  There is no question that the objective was to manipulate the public discourse on the Scally report in advance of its publication.  This is not new.

Can the Taoiseach update us on the current stage of the investigation?  My understanding is that a limited number of people had access to the information that somehow found its way into the public domain so it is a little odd that the senior person, given whatever assistance the Taoiseach has provided, cannot identify the person concerned.  It is not as if there were multiple copies of this report left lying around so I cannot understand the reason for the delay.  Has the Taoiseach identified the person who leaked the report?

None of the recommendations appeared in the press, nor did any of the findings.  What appeared in the press in advance was one aspect of the report, which was that it was Dr. Scally's opinion that a commission of inquiry was not warranted.  None of the recommendations or findings was leaked, only the aspect concerning Dr. Scally's opinion regarding a commission of investigation.  Perhaps one could say that one line from the entire report was leaked to the press in advance.<\/p>  <p>  I note Deputy Martin's allegations.  He regularly makes allegations in the House without any evidence to support them.  He certainly has a penchant for innuendo and conspiracy theories.  The report would have been available to more than the Department of Health and the Office of the Taoiseach.  It would have been available to Dr. Scally, his team and many of the advisers who assisted him in putting the report together.  Deputy Martin's presumption that only somebody in the Government, a civil servant or a politician had access to the report is not the case.  Of course, it could have been leaked by somebody who did not have the report at all because all that was leaked was one aspect of it - the fact that it was Dr. Scally's opinion that a commission of inquiry was not required.  It could have been done on a verbal basis.  As is always the case, unless there is a paper or documentary trail of some nature it is difficult to identify the culprit.  Certainly, if the person is identified and if he or she is a civil servant, politician or adviser, the person will be disciplined.  If the person is not, that does not fall to me.<\/p>  <p>  The only people who know are the journalists involved.  They have been asked for their co-operation.

It was a key issue.  The Minister for Health had agreed in the D&aacute;il to a commission of inquiry.  He came under pressure in the House and for whatever reason capitulated on that evening and said there would be a commission of inquiry.  The Taoiseach followed suit.  It was significant, therefore, that prior to the publication of the report a steer or spin occurred, the spin being that there was no need for a commission of inquiry.  The cynical or sceptical might say that the last thing those in authority and the various stakeholders wanted was a commission of inquiry into this and, therefore, spun in that direction via the Scally report.  That is one possibility.  A significant element was leaked and I believe it was done for a specific reason, which was to undermine the case for a commission of inquiry.  Whether one agrees or disagrees, the objective of the leak was to move away from the idea that there should be a commission of inquiry into the CervicalCheck issue.  I speak as somebody who initially supported the Government regarding a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, inquiry.  However, under pressure on the floor of the House, the Minister caved in and said there would be a commission of inquiry.  Ever since Dr. Scally has reported the emphasis has been on moving away from a commission of inquiry.

Would the Taoiseach accept that this is one of the major challenges facing society?  In the past 50 years, free education has delivered enormously for society.  The next major challenge is around how to bring people who are at the periphery of society, and those who are most disadvantaged, back into society.  It is through education that it will happen but there is no sense of a coherent strategy at Government level in the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality and Education and Skills to see if we can tackle the social isolation felt and experienced by young people and older people from various strands of society.

We all know about the public housing crisis, and we are aware of the dire situation in our public health service, but one crisis that is less remarked on but which is very severe is the crisis in third level education.  That crisis was not in any way addressed or acknowledged in the Government's recent budget.  The Taoiseach may have noted that the Irish Universities Association released a statement recently expressing significant regret at the failure of the Government to address the funding crisis for third level education.  The Union of Students in Ireland and other student union bodies have also expressed huge disappointment at the Taoiseach's failure to address the funding crisis for third level education and for student poverty.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that we have a crisis and that Ireland is at the bottom of the league table in Europe for funding per student?  The Irish Universities Association has helpfully included a graph with its statement, which compares Ireland with other European countries.  It shows the State investment per student in the following countries: Finland &euro;20,000 per student; Germany &euro;10,000 per student; The Netherlands &euro;14,000 per student; Norway &euro;16,000 per student; Sweden &euro;19,000 per student; and Ireland &euro;5,000 per student.  Ireland's &euro;5,000 funding per student is a tiny fraction of what is invested in third level education cross Europe.  This per student investment is going to further decline, because according to the Minister's budget speech we are expecting another 18,000 people to enter further education and university over the next number of years.  The budget, however, gave the sector a 1% increase in funding.  It was &euro;19 million extra, which is nothing.  It is a drop in the ocean that will be mopped up many times over by the increased student numbers.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that there is a problem here?

Students in schools in my constituency, and in the Taoiseach's constituency, and their parents are worried and, naturally, very anxious.  Significant structural issues have been found.  They relate to fire safety concerns, especially in Ardgillan community college.

I am not sure that I fully understood the question.  If the Deputy wants to come back with a supplementary question I would be happy to try to answer it again, once I understand the question.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments, I acknowledge the shortcomings, challenges and failures that exist in our public services in Ireland.  On listening to Deputy Barrett again and again, one would think that we lived in the worst country in the world and that Ireland was some sort of wasteland, and that it was an awful place to live and be a citizen.  Yet, this is a country that the UN human development index ranks fourth in the world.  That is not a measure of GDP.  It is not a measure of the size of our economy.  This index takes into account health, education, life expectancy and the quality of our public services.  The UN human development index ranks Ireland as fourth in the world, which is up from tenth or eleventh place not that long ago.  If a small UN committee made a criticism of Ireland, Deputy Boyd Barrett would be the first on his feet to tell us how awful we are, but when the UN Development Programme, with its well respected human development index, ranks us fourth in the world, the Deputy does not want to acknowledge that.  Ireland is rising, for example, when it comes to the social progress index, and it has been for a number of years.  The Deputy does not want to acknowledge that.  When we consider the Central Statistics Office statistics, the survey of income and living conditions shows that poverty and deprivation is falling in Ireland, that income inequality is narrowing, and that inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient is narrowing.  Again, the Deputy does not want to acknowledge any of that.  The Deputy also does not want to acknowledge the fact that employment levels in Ireland are at their highest.  It seems to me that there is very much a double standard here.  The Deputy wants to come in, use every example of anything that is wrong in the country but he never acknowledges the progress that we are making in the country, and he never acknowledges the fact that when taken in the round Ireland is a good country, it is a good place to live and we offer our citizens a lot of opportunities.  Yes, we can do better, but if one wants to do better one starts by acknowledging what is going well and then try to fix the things that are wrong.  One does not just rubbish everything and everyone and everything they do.  That is a defeatist and nihilistic attitude and it will not bring about any positive change for any citizens in our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300022#U02500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1540309500,"counter":227,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has not answered my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300022#U02600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1540309500,"counter":228,"content":"<p>On higher education specifically, the budget provides for an increase of between &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million next year.

One only has to travel around the country and visit our colleges and institutes of technology to see how many new buildings have been built in recent years and we are going to see a lot more.

It is going to be necessary to inspect approximately 40 schools that were built by this particular company.  We anticipate that work will be done this week, over the Hallowe'en break.  We anticipate it being completed by the middle of November.  In some cases works are going to be needed.  Those works will be done.  In some cases it may be necessary to partially or entirely vacate some schools, in others it may be possible to introduce temporary measures and to do the works over the summer.  We will pursue the builder in the courts.  In fact, that is already under way in respect of some of the fire safety issues.  It certainly appears that corners were cut back in the Celtic tiger period when it came to the building of some of these schools.  That is truly disgraceful.  We are in a very different position now.  For the last couple of years a clerk of works was present on site every day when a school was being built in order to make sure that it was built up to standard.  It certainly appears that prior to 2014 or 2015, and particularly during the Celtic tiger period, schools were built without proper oversight.  We now have to go back, make sure they are safe, fix them, and pursue the people responsible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300023#V00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1540310100,"counter":232,"content":"<p>There are two points to my question.  One relates to social policy.  The Taoiseach speaks about everything that is right in this country.  I preface my remarks by saying that one of the greatest social changes was free second level education.  It has now empowered almost three generations of people.  It has certainly worked enormously well but I believe that as many as 18%, or at least 10% to 15%, of people in our society are severely disadvantaged in where they are living because of family backgrounds and so forth.  They suffer from social problems, drug addiction and everything else.  They are living all over the country; they are dispersed and are not only located in the large urban centres.  The major challenge as we go forward as a society will be developing a coherent social policy that will empower these people.  People 50 years ago used the education services to improve their lot.  These people are not engaging with the education services, with the health services or with society as a whole in terms of community activity or anything else.  The major social policy question is what is the Government's thinking?  Has it come up with any special Cabinet committees to look at what social policies should be developed?

The analysis points out that we are spending a small fraction of what most other European countries are spending per student.  The Taoiseach's comparison with health is facile because it fails to acknowledge that quite a considerable amount of that expenditure is out of pocket expenditure by people paying accident and emergency charges, overnight bed charges, and prescription charges.  That is all included in the expenditure as is, for that matter, private health insurance.  Public funding of health is a very different matter but we are talking about universities.  The point is we are way down the league table and our universities are now tumbling in the international rankings.

The second priority is to carry out the inspections of the 40 schools and to get that done as soon as we possibly can in order to find out what kind of works need to be done, to get them done, and to pursue the builder for the costs through the courts.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of Deputy Boyd Barrett's further contribution, I did not think there was a further question but I did answer his original question in my previous contribution when I said that funding for higher education is being increased.  It was increased last year and it will be increased next year as well.  It is important we make sure that the money is spent as well as possible.  We should judge ourselves on outcomes, not on how much we spend.  That applies across all areas of the public service.<\/p>  <p>  On social policy, I think I understand the question but I do not have the answer.

A number of areas within the HSE are contributing to the overspend in 2018.  These include higher payouts under the State Claims Agency, a shortfall in private patient income, a higher level of spend in the acute and disability services sectors and, for example, the additional costs associated with Storm Emma, which amounted to about &euro;40 million.  The overspend in services is driven by the non-achievement of planned savings, higher levels and higher complexity of demand, costs associated with meeting national regulatory standards in the disability sector and the need for additional emergency placements for children and young people with disabilities.  Finally and importantly, an amount of &euro;280 million was provided in the 2018 Revised Estimates for appropriations-in-aid receipts from the UK in respect of healthcare provided under EU regulations.  These receipts are now estimated at &euro;225 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;55 million against the provision.<\/p><p>The HSE advises that the savings projected to be achieved by year end under the value improvement programme will be in the region of &euro;80 million.  The introduction of a savings programme into the HSE's 2018 national service plan reflects the commitment we must have in the health service to achieve greater value and efficiency across the totality of resources at its disposal.  With major increases in public funding for our health services in recent years to a level which compares favourably with spending in other countries, it is important that the scope to develop services through the improved management of existing resources also receives ongoing attention.<\/p><p>In presenting its 2018 national service plan in late 2017, the HSE conveyed its view of what it saw as the significant financial challenge of implementing the plan within the allocated budget for 2018.  This was not a secret; it was published on pages 2 and 3 of the national service plan.  In response, I confirmed to the HSE that the plan was to be framed having regard to the funding available.  The health sector was but one of several priority areas competing for additional funding in 2018 from the fiscal space available to the Government.  I pointed out that over &euro;600 million in additional funding was provided for the health sector in the 2018 budget and that the HSE&rsquo;s allocation had increased by approximately 20% since 2015, or by an average of 6.6% per annum, which is ahead of both the programme for Government and the confidence and supply agreement level of increase.  Taking the significant 2018 and prior year allocations into account, it is clear that issues of budgetary performance need to be addressed in certain areas and that the HSE should discharge its accountability in this regard under the performance and accountability framework. <\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>As part of the monthly performance cycle, my Department holds the HSE to account for its expenditure and for the delivery of the services set out in the national service plan.  Performance in respect of service delivery and finance is monitored monthly and, where services are experiencing significant performance issues, the HSE is required to submit an escalation report.  Finally, the Government is committed to a significant programme of legislative and managerial reform to improve performance and accountability in the HSE.  This includes the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018, which is currently before the Oireachtas.  This legislation will establish an independent board governance structure for the HSE, and as one of its functions will support the chief executive officer and HSE executive team in developing a more effective performance management and accountability system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300024#W00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1540310700,"counter":244,"content":"<p>What I hear from the Minister causes concern because the Minister is telling us the HSE told him towards the end of last year that it was not a big enough budget and that there would be an overrun.

I assume that is what the Minister did.  The Minister got the budget he got, which the D&aacute;il voted on.  The HSE came back to the Minister late last year and said it was not enough money for the service plan so the Minister had to do one of two things.  He had to either increase the budget or reduce the service plan.  Did the Minister instruct the HSE to reduce the service plan to make sure the HSE could deliver on budget?  Presumably he did.  If he did that, what has happened to lead to a nearly &euro;800 million overrun?  Saying things like Storm Emma and unforeseen events is not an acceptable rationale.

This is not the first year the HSE has needed a supplementary budget.  If one looks back to 2006, we had a long-stay charges repayment scheme of &euro;1 billion.  We had shortfalls of &euro;240 million and overrun of demand led schemes in 2007, &euro;345 million in 2008, &euro;595 million in 2010 and &euro;680 million in 2014.  I am not saying it is a good thing but we all know we need to reform our health service in order that it can deliver value for money and improve services, which is why we have all signed up to the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  The law is very clear.  The HSE has a legal obligation under the Health Act to present a service plan that it signs up to delivering.  It can highlight risks and challenges and it did highlight those risks and challenges.  Ultimately when it submits a service plan to the Minister of the day, it is committing to deliver the services contained within the service plan.  It is its legal responsibility.  We need to improve the oversight and governance structures.  That is why I have appointed Sir Ciar&aacute;n Devane as the new chair designate of the HSE board.  That is why I want to put a competency-based board in place as well.  The Deputy may talk about Storm Emma or the State Claims Agency costs and say they do not explain it but they explain a fair bit of it.  Let us just take the State Claims Agency as an example.  We cannot predict the level of claims being paid out every year.  It as clear there was an overrun in that area.  It is clear Storm Emma cost &euro;40 million.  It was also clear, let us be honest, that when it came to our acute hospitals and disability sector there was a significant overspend.  When the Deputy asks what I told the HSE to do, I certainly did not tell it to reduce those services because when one is the Minister for Health, one does not have the luxury of telling sick people they are to go home and come back the next year.

He can come back to the D&aacute;il and tell us he needs an extra &euro;600 million, &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million, whatever the HSE tells the Minister.  The other choice is to go back to the HSE and say he is sorry but this is the amount of money D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has voted him and they will have to figure out how to bring this in on budget.  No one is suggesting that sick people are sent away.  The Minister knows that is not being suggested.

Despite these challenges, however, the data show that we have managed to increase the number of nurses and midwives employed, which should not be ignored in this debate.<\/p>  <p>  When the number of nurses and midwives employed by the HSE is compared between September 2017 and September 2018, it shows there has been an increase of 1,050 whole-time equivalents, including student nurses.  Without student nurses, the increase is 1,039 whole-time equivalents.  The Deputy refers to a statement made by the HSE in its annual report for 2017 which in many ways confirms what we already know - that we are operating within a competitive recruitment market when it comes to filling positions involving health professionals, not least nurses and midwives.<\/p>  <p>  The recent pay proposals put forward were a positive step towards making the public health service a more attractive place to work for nurses and midwives.  The PSPC recommended an increase of 20% to the specialist qualification and location allowances for nurses.  The allowances are also to be extended to maternity services.  In addition, the commission recommended the eligibility requirements for a senior staff nurse or midwife be reduced from 20 years to 17 years.<\/p>  <p>The Government also proposed to address the issue of new entrant pay, not just for nurses but across the public service, which will benefit approximately 10,000 nurses to the value of approximately &euro;3,000 each.<\/p>  <p>  I am sorry the INMO rejected these proposals but I respect the outcome of its ballot.

Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;55 million for the development of mental health services, and I acknowledge Deputy Browne's commitment to this area also.  The additional funding allocated to mental health services since 2012 has provided for the recruitment of more than 1,500 posts in mental health since 2012.  In the last year alone, the number of psychiatrists increased by 14.<\/p>  <p>There are 340 consultant psychiatrists in the mental health services and 83 vacancies.  The HSE uses locums, short-term contracts and other arrangements to fill many of these posts to support service delivery.  In addition, we have developed our capacity in primary care through the funding of 114 assistant psychologists, a new grade whose positive impact I have seen first hand, 20 psychologists and ten advanced nurse practitioners.  This will help to manage the demand and improve access to psychiatry services.<\/p>  <p>  A focus of funding for 2019 will be on early intervention and support services that will assist as many service users as possible in dealing with mental health challenges before they require acute or psychiatric care.  The Government remains committed to increasing the consultant workforce and there is a significant need for psychiatrists.  It is generally acknowledged, however, that there are difficulties in recruiting and retaining certain grades of staff, particularly specialist child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, staff and consultant psychiatrists.  This is an issue not just in Ireland but internationally.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE undertakes continuing recruitment of consultant psychiatrists.  Campaigns have targeted international events involving prospective candidates.  In its report published on 4 September, the PSPC identified difficulties in attracting consultant applications for many posts and acknowledged that the pay rates for new entrants had been highlighted as a factor in this.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has published proposals regarding mitigation of the extended salary scales for new entrants across the public service under section 4 of the PSSA.  Two separate interventions will take place at the fourth and eighth points of pay scales, involving the bypassing of two scale points.  This measure will apply from 1 March 2019 and will be applied to eligible new entrants as they reach the relevant scale points on their current increment date.

The development of a sustainable scoliosis service has been prioritised by my Department and the HSE in 2018.  An additional &euro;9 million was provided to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, CHG, in 2018 to support the development and implementation of a sustainable and safe paediatric orthopaedic service for children and young people. <\/p>  <p>  The increased investment in scoliosis has brought stability to the service and the current capacity for services has expanded.

I acknowledge that it is not her word, but when the Deputy refers to manipulation, we should be clear that the number of procedures being done each year is increasing and will have doubled since 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  Waiting list figures for 12 October show 130 patients waiting, which includes patients who have been asked to come in for a procedure, those who have been given a date for a procedure in the near future - often one needs a date that works for the patient both clinically and logistically - and those who are waiting for a date for a procedure.

Patients are placed on the suspended list for clinical reasons such as being clinically unwell and unfit for surgery, requiring further investigations and procedures prior to their scoliosis treatment, or their condition being managed conservatively and not requiring surgical intervention at this time. <\/p>  <p>  Families may also request a suspension for non-clinical reasons, which is also understandable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300026#Y00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1540311900,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I understand that 347 surgeries have been performed to date.

Those posts are currently being processed and we expect that appointments will be made by the end of this year.

For that reason, the scoliosis co-design team is working with three advocacy groups, the consultants and Mr. Brian O'Mahony as the independent chair, to come up with a pathway of care.

Significant progress has been made over a number of years and over the lifetime of successive Governments in dealing with cancer treatment, with significantly improving survival rates in our country.  The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 aims to build on the progress already made, with improved cancer prevention, diagnostics, treatment and aftercare support.  The Irish Cancer Society made a significant input into the drawing up of the strategy and plays a very positive role in supporting people affected by cancer, for which I thank it.<\/p>  <p>  While I appreciate the sentiment behind the society's campaign on hospital charges, making exemptions to these charges on the basis of illness or treatment risks creating inequity within the system.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory co-payment, which is capped at a level that is not large relative to the true cost of providing hospital services, represents an important contribution towards hospitals' operating costs.  While the overall charges are subject to ongoing review, we all need to be honest with each other about the significant financial implications their overall abolition would have.<\/p>  <p>  In budget 2019 the Government decided to prioritise the extension of the GP visit card income thresholds, the reduction in the drug payment scheme monthly threshold and the reduction in the prescription charges for those aged over 70 with a medical card.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy commits to consider all existing charges in the context of the annual budgetary process and this will allow for priorities to be determined in reviewing and considering the scope for a reduction in charges.<\/p>  <p>  I would rather see a situation where we reduce charges overall than a situation whereby we pick a reduction based on disease or condition.  While a strong case can be made, as the Irish Cancer Society did, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, cystic fibrosis and other conditions could equally make the case.  We are on a road of reform with Sl&aacute;intecare that is committed to reducing further inpatient charges and the fact the current charges are capped at a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 months is the roadmap to use.  The Department will review eligibility and charges as part of our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation and I will certainly consider it in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300029#BB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1540313700,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It indicates that people are on a fairly restricted budget.  Many cancer treatments are over a protracted period of time.  Generally people are either in work less or not at all.  They have a reduction in income and at the very time they have a reduction in income they have additional treatment charges.  While the Minister rightly states he is trying to reduce charges and that the maximum inpatient charge in a year is &euro;800, this is a significant amount of money at a time when people are experiencing a reduction in income.  It is for a specific cohort of people, not those who are particularly affluent but those who are squeezed, who pay for everything and who get very little in return.

What I am trying to say is that in addressing this burden I want to try to do so in a way that is not disease specific but recognises the fact there has to be an equity of access, and there are many people with a wide range of disease and illness who find themselves going to our hospitals quite a lot.

As the Deputy is aware, it is envisaged that most terminations up to nine weeks of pregnancy will take place in the community setting.  Several medical practitioners have expressed an interest in providing termination of pregnancy services.  The Deputy heard the evidence of representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners in that regard to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  Officials in my Department and the HSE are drafting contractual proposals for the provision of these services.  It is intended that the contract will be available to qualified medical practitioners who wish to provide the services as well as organisations that provide women&rsquo;s health services.

Furthermore, 40,000 first outpatient appointments will be arranged.  This is a very important point.  As has been acknowledged by Fianna F&aacute;il, we have made significant progress.  There has been a very significant reduction in the inpatient day case list, from approximately 86,000 people waiting for hospital operations or procedures at its peak to the low 70,000s.  The number waiting is projected to continue to drop month on month.  We know the investment is making a difference in that area.  We now need to target outpatient lists, which is why I will be putting a particular focus on those 40,000 first outpatient appointments in terms of the resourcing of the NTPF.<\/p>  <p>  There have been ongoing improvements in the number of patients waiting for inpatient and day case procedures this year, with the number now at 72,700, down from a peak of 86,100.  That is a 16% reduction and the number awaiting treatment will continue to fall.  The number of patients waiting for over nine months has reduced from over 28,000 to under 19,000 in the same period, a 32% reduction.  It is expected that through the combination of HSE and NTPF activity this trend will continue.  It is projected that the overall number of patients on the inpatient day case waiting list will reduce to approximately 70,000 by the end of this year and to under 59,000 by the end of 2019.<\/p><p>NTPF activity next year will cover approximately 50 high to medium-volume procedures and will be through a combination of treating patients in outsourced facilities and public in-sourced facilities.  I will publish a waiting list plan with the NTPF detailing that but about 50 high to medium-volume procedures will be targeted in 2019.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300030#CC01100","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540314900,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  In the opening part of the reply, he mentioned that spending has gone up by 150% from what it was a number of years ago.  Yes, it has because it came off the back of a very low base.  I am glad to see the Minister acknowledge and identify the procedures that are being carried out.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to play politics with it but I want to be very serious.  A decade ago, we were spending more than &euro;75 million on the NTPF at a time when the total health budget was considerably less than the &euro;17 billion it is today.  The Minister quite rightly identified the various procedures, including 40,000 people on the outpatient list who can be targeted this year.  I am concerned that he is not ambitious enough in respect of the NTPF.  Over the past number of years, these lists across outpatients and so forth have grown very significantly.  There is an opportunity to be more ambitious.  I would have hoped that the budget for the NTPF this year would have been more like &euro;100 million rather than &euro;75 million and that we would have a really ambitious programme.  I say that on the day when the Taoiseach stood where the Minister now stands and said that if anybody had any suggestions for the extra &euro;1 billion in health, they should tell him.

As the Deputy rightly says, the HSE has a budget of over &euro;17 billion.  I would make the point, particularly when Deputy O'Reilly is here, that it is not all for outsourcing either.  An awful lot of it can and should be used on in-sourcing.  I have met all the hospital groups in recent days and weeks and have asked them to put forward their proposals for in-sourcing.  For example, we have opened a cataract theatre in Nenagh as a result of that.  I must also make the point that outpatient waiting lists were not published until a few years so people who say the lists are at a record high are not comparing like with like.  The previous figures were never published.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen a lot of progress, for example, with regard to cataracts.  At the end of July 2017, there were 10,024 people on the waiting list.

To date in 2018, the NTPF has approved almost 12,700 additional first-time outpatient appointments and this will increase to 40,000 appointments next year.  I recently met with the CEOs of all hospital groups to discuss improving access for patients and requested that they work with the NTPF and HSE to develop new proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019.<\/p> <p> Sligo University Hospital, through engagement with the NTPF, will be running an additional ear, nose and throat, ENT, clinic every week from November to help reduce those waiting for their first appointment.  This is good news for people in the Deputy's county.  Sligo University Hospital specifically, and Saolta Hospital Group, have demonstrated a clear commitment to reducing the number of outpatients waiting to be seen.  Since 2017 additional outpatient clinics have been held for gynaecology, general medicine and neurology to increase the number of patients seen and reduce long waiting times.  Sligo has also embraced several other approaches, including the use of virtual clinics in the orthopaedic department; a restructuring of the acute pain clinic to allow for referrals to be triaged and treated by a multidisciplinary specialist team; and the development of an ophthalmology service.  The Sligo eye care model which people talk so much about is something that I would like to see rolled out as part of our Sl&aacute;intecare plans and our HSE service plan in 2019.  We will have funding for additional outpatient and hospital appointments in 2019.  I will work with the Saolta group to consider more initiatives for Sligo.

It cherry-picked patients and allowed people who had not necessarily waited the longest to be seen.  Therefore it did not prioritise the longest-waiting patients.  It had a self-referral system that allowed a degree of cherry-picking and it did not do nearly enough insourcing.

He has an idea of the general theme.<\/p>  <p>  A constituent of mine received a copy of a bill from a particular private hospital that had been paid by the individual's health insurer.  It is for two stents inserted and a one-night stay in a private ward in the hospital from 11 a.m. one morning until 11 a.m. the following morning.  The person used all their own tablets.  The cost of the medical treatment seemed reasonable at approximately &euro;1,000 and given the serious nature of the procedure, my constituent was happy enough with that charge.  However, there was a charge of &euro;7,055 for the use of the hospital's facilities and bed for a 24-hour period - probably somewhat less than that.<\/p>  <p>  As this seems an outrageous figure to a layperson I did some investigation into it.  I was told that included in such a payment would be things such as the use of theatre, recovery space for a patient, perhaps consumable costs but not drugs in this case, and then what the insurers might call the hotel-like accommodation costs for keeping a patient overnight.  These are probably fees agreed between all insurers and private hospitals.  This is a semi-private room and not a fully private room.  There does not seem to be a great variation between what is agreed between each private insurer and each private hospital.  Therefore there is not a significant difference between what insurers are paying to private hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  If this procedure had been carried out for my constituent as a private patient in a public hospital, I am told the rate of reimbursement to a public hospital for a private patient would be approximately &euro;1,000 for this procedure, the insertion of two stents.  Here is the nub of the issue.  What is the real cost of this?  I am told by the public hospital that &euro;1,000 probably does not cover this and that it is about &euro;500 per stent.  That is just for the stent, but that &euro;7,000 is nowhere near the accurate cost of it either.  Therefore, if I go as a private patient into a public hospital for a procedure, the public hospital will receive &euro;1,000 from the insurer, but if I go in as a semi-private patient into a private hospital, the insurer will pay &euro;7,000.<\/p>  <p>  I am thinking of all the people who scrimp and save.  During hard times there were two things most families kept going: health insurance and the mortgage.  That the cost of private insurance is so exorbitant must be linked to these kinds of charges from private hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300033#FF01500","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1540316100,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  I am aware of the particular case he mentioned.<\/p><p>The charges that apply in a private hospital are the subject of negotiation between the health insurers and the health service providers.  The rates for particular procedures are the subject of agreement between insurers and medical consultants, while the rates that apply for accommodation and other services in private hospitals are agreed between health insurers and each individual private hospital.  Since health insurers can negotiate with private hospitals and with consultants, it is in the insurers&rsquo; interest to negotiate the best possible rate they can for procedures and services for their customers, as this will control their claims costs.<\/p><p>This is in contrast with the public hospital setting, where under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 a <i>per diem<\/i>charge applies when a patient is admitted to hospital and the patient opts to be treated on a private basis.  Health insurers cannot negotiate with the HSE and the rates are set by legislation.  There is an objective in setting such charges from public hospitals to reduce the subsidy to private practice, including the changes that were made following the 2010 Comptroller and Auditor General report.  It should be noted that in recent years there has been no increase in private charges by public hospitals, notwithstanding the significant increase in costs, including salaries.<\/p><p>My colleague the Minister for Health has no role in the commercial decisions of any health insurer, and has no role in the charges for accommodation and other services that apply in any private hospital.  It is neither possible nor appropriate to comment on individual procedures without knowing the full circumstances and clinical decisions involved.<\/p><p>In general terms, care provided in a hospital setting will always be more expensive than care provided in a community setting and surgical procedures are considerably more expensive than medical procedures.<\/p><p>I note that there was a 1% decrease in claims paid by insurers last year, primarily because of a drop in insurance claims paid to public hospitals.<\/p><p>Significantly, from the perspective of the individual patient, it should be noted that in our community-rated health insurance market, an individual&rsquo;s premium will not be affected by his or her own claims history.  By law, insurers are not allowed to charge an individual a higher premium based on any of the individual&rsquo;s personal circumstances.  Instead, the premium for a health insurance plan is set at a rate where insurers will cover the expected claims costs that will arise based on the coverage received by their customers who are availing of that plan.<\/p><p> Our community-rated private health insurance market is underpinned by a risk equalisation scheme.  The scheme involves a community rating levy collected by the Revenue Commissioners from insurers in respect of all policies written.  All of the moneys collected are paid over to the risk equalisation fund administered by the independent regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, HIA.  The authority then redistributes the fund back to the market through credits payable to insurers in respect of insured lives to offset some of the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members.  The scheme is Exchequer neutral, with neither a cost nor a benefit to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300033#FF01600","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540316700,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The consultants' costs are not being questioned in this case.  I take his point on the State having no role in charging for accommodation.  Is he not even half scandalised by the cost?  There has to be a trickle-down impact from the charging of more than &euro;7,000 for an \"overnight stay\" in a semi-private room in a private hospital.  I have been informed by people who know far more about this than I do that the equivalent stay in a public hospital for the same procedure costs &euro;1,000.  The Minister of State has explained why and said that legislation is covering it.  He said &euro;1,000 does not cover the cost.  There is no way, however, it would cost &euro;7,000.<\/p>  <p>  Many constituents have shown politicians, including the Minister of State, bills received for treatment covered by private health insurers in respect of which they have been pleasantly surprised by the cost of the consultant or surgeon but absolutely outraged by, and left gasping at, the cost of the hospital facilities, even for the shortest of stays, particularly where there has not been an overnight stay.  I realise there is a cost associated with equipment, plant and ancillary staff.  Would it not help, however, if the insurer provided to the subscriber a detailed breakdown of exactly where every single cent of the sum in excess of &euro;7,000 went.?  If there are hundreds of patients in a hospital in any given week, millions of euro are paid over by health insurers.  I have read reports that the payouts last year were marginally lower, resulting in marginally lower premiums for people.  Given, however, the increases in the cost of living experienced by people over the past year, including in the cost of motor and health insurance, surely there is something the Government can do as opposed to just reciting the law and the negotiating stance of health insurers.  Surely the Government could do something for the insurer when it sees the outrageous amounts health insurers are charged by private hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300034#GG00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1540316700,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Private hospitals have, and will continue to have, an important role in our national health system.  In future, however, I hope patients will be able to make an informed choice between receiving care in a private hospital, using their health insurance or another payment method, and receiving care in a world-class public hospital system.  That is our plan and what we intend to do.  We must also examine the issue of cost.  Patients and Deputy Lahart should note my focus must always be on the safety of the patient.  If it costs a little extra to insure and to save a person's life, I will be strongly supportive of that position.

We all understand that very much.<\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including an obligation under sections 9 and 10 to engage in an information and consultation process with employees' representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.<\/p>  <p>  Section 11A of the Act provides that, where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of section 9 or section 10, he or she may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.

It is the liquidator&rsquo;s responsibility to seek, on behalf of employees, payment from the redundancy payments scheme in respect of statutory redundancy and from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of wage related entitlements.  An eligible employee is entitled to two weeks' statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  To qualify for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must have at least two years of continuous service, be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts and be over the age of 16 years.  Entitlements covered under the insolvency payments scheme are arrears of wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice and certain pension contributions.  Payments are calculated by reference to an employee's wages and are subject to a limit of &euro;600 per week.  Arrears of wages, sick pay, holiday pay and minimum notice are limited to eight weeks.<\/p> <p> My Department will ensure that the affected employees receive advice on jobseeker's payments and other income supports that may be available to them and will provide support to them in returning to work or accessing appropriate education and training and development options.

An information and recruitment event for the workforce will be held in the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Dundalk on Thursday, 1 November next.  The event will be supported by other key service providers.  Local employers with job vacancies have also committed to attend.  The key message for employees is that the Department will provide any redundancy, insolvency and jobseeker payments to which they may be entitled in a timely manner and will proactively help them to access opportunities available for employment.<\/p> <p> Finally, the Workplace Relations Commission's customer service section provides information on the rights and obligations of employees and employers, respectively, under employment rights legislation.

I will put the children's names on the record.  They are Kelly Semple, Josh O'Shea, James Tiernan, Latoyah Bowers, Jason Moran and Jack Reilly.  These children received an excellent education in a special autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in Scoil Na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge.  Some 18 months ago when we collectively discussed the next steps in this regard it suddenly dawned on the Department of Education and Skills that no provision had been made at the next level for when these children would leave the ASD unit.  There were many conversations, meetings, telephone calls and emails.  In fact, I brought the parents to an education committee meeting which was dealing with the area of special educational needs in order that they could have an understanding of how we deal with these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Nine weeks after 1 September, when the children were told they would have a place in St. Conleth's Community College, Newbridge, they have not had an hour or a day of education.  If the shoe were on the other foot and the children were not going to school, the State and the Department would bring their parents to court for non-attendance at school.<\/p><p>The delays in opening the extension of the St. Conleth&rsquo;s community college and the delay in opening the autistic spectrum, ASD, unit are directly impacting on the education of the children who are waiting and on their families.  They are not the school's fault.  All children, including children with special educational needs, have a right to an education that is appropriate to their needs.  Education should be about enabling all children, in line with their abilities, to live full and independent lives so that they can contribute to their communities, co-operate with other people and continue to learn throughout their lives.<\/p> <p> These six children, however, are yet to start their school year, despite commitments that were made in January 2018.  At a meeting in January, the parents were told by a principal officer of the Department of Education and Skills who is in charge of special education provision, and by the head of operations for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that if there was a delay, alternative accommodation would be in place by 1 September.  This has not happened.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The parents feel very let down by the system, which I can understand.  The system was meant to support and nurture their children.  I am aware that this morning the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, lodged an application with Kildare County Council to open part of the ground floor extension.  This, however, can take up to another three weeks, which leaves us well into November.  It is completely unacceptable that these children are still waiting to start school.  They still have no date on which they can start school, there is still no alternative accommodation put in place and there is no home tuition in place.  That commitment was fully given in January in respect of the six children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300035#HH00800","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540317900,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I shall go straight into the substantive issue of the reply.  There is a preamble around the general allocation of money in this sector.  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision is required in an area, it is planned and provided for.  The NCSE sanctioned a new special class in St. Conleth's community college to meet the identified needs of students in Kildare, and the relevant teaching and SNA support has been allocated to the school.  To this end, the Department is providing a stand-alone extension to the community college in Newbridge.  This extension will provide 4,602 sq. m  of additional accommodation, including a PE hall and 552 sq. m of accommodation for children with special needs, to complement the existing 3,072 sq. m building.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Department devolved the project for delivery to the KWETB.  The contractor was appointed for the project in October 2015.  Unfortunately, the project was significantly delayed primarily as a result of contractual issues.  Though progress has been less than satisfactory throughout the project, I am pleased that the building work on this project is now complete.  The Deputy will be aware of this from her conversations with the KWETB this morning.  A small number of snagging and defects issues that remained to be rectified and that prevented the extension being ready in time for 1 September have now been addressed.  Additionally, some further drainage issues that emerged and which led to a further delay in the completion of the project have been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge how disappointing these difficulties have been for the school community, including the pupils and parents concerned.  It is, however, in the nature of any building project that unforeseen issues can arise.  The objective is always to deal with these as quickly as possible to minimise delay and this has been the focus of KWETB and its design team.  When a building is completed, certifications for the constituent components are required to be registered with the local authority for the purposes of demonstrating that the building complies with building control regulations.  This was done yesterday.  The local authority is required to turn this around within three weeks.  After hearing of the Deputy's intervention, I would implore if possible that the turnaround time be brought into a more realistic timeframe.  The schools rise at the end of this week and they will then have the week off.  To give parents a bit of certainty on the issue I would like to see that happen.  I am aware there is a three-week turnaround, and if this is possible I would certainly support that.<\/p>  <p>  KWETB is actively communicating with the key stakeholders in respect of this project.  The school management is in regular contact with the parents concerned to keep them informed of progress with the project and met with them recently in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300036#JJ00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1540317900,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I appreciate his good intentions in this regard.  He referred to school places and supports being planned for and being provided but the kernel to this is that these places were not planned for and were not provided.  Last January a sticking plaster was applied to the problem.  The problem is going to escalate in the area.  As of last year, we only had 18 places that were suitable or available for children with special needs who were leaving mainstream primary schools.  In this situation another three weeks means it will have been 12 weeks - three months - during which these children were without any type of education.  This is completely wrong.  The impacts for any child of staying out of education for this length of time can have lasting effects on their progress in school and on learning.  This especially applies to children with special educational needs.  To be fair, I am aware that the Minister has only been in office for one week but officials in his office had told the parents that alternative accommodation would be in place by 1 November.  We are now at 23 October and we have heard nothing about that, and now it is to be pushed back another three weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled stated: \"In the meantime, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is continuing to work with the school and the parents to ensure that the appropriate supports are in place, including application for home tuition.\"  No supports whatsoever have been put in place for these six children or their parents.  This is absolutely and completely wrong.  Home tuition is a poor substitute for children who are used to attending school.  It amounts to only a maximum of nine hours per week.  From day one, we have said that this was not going to be acceptable.  Alternative avenues must be considered to have these children in the classroom to ensure that the impact on their education is minimal.  Let this be a lesson going forward to the Department and to the Minister with regard to other situations like this around the country.  It is simply not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300036#JJ00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1540317900,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I agree that this is an important issue.

We can explore that further, but up to 20 hours a week can be provided for home school tuition.  If the council has to take that three weeks, and if we need it in place for the week after Halloween and it be arranged, I will be happy to facilitate that.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, that does not compensate for the physical building and being in a space with their peers.  People may feel isolated enough because of certain situations and to be learning with their peers is where they want to be, first and foremost.

The seriousness of that should not be lost on this House.  If the Minister were in opposition and speaking on education, he would tell Fianna F&aacute;il that it started the problem by abolishing the rigorous independent control inspections carried out by local councils in 1990 and replacing them with a series of self-certifications.  The legacy of the Galway tent and all the rest that goes with that tradition has proved to be a disaster.  What now faces us is the urgent need to make sure that schools which house children are safe.  I would like us to discuss how in the name of God this happened.

Western Building Systems has stated in the media that a substantial completion certificate was issued by the Department.  Is this the case?  Can the Minister confirm that the Department certified this work as being appropriate, as Western Building Systems has said?  If it did not do so, has it ever checked works independently itself or has it always relied on certificates of completion whether under the old regulation or the new regulations?  When did the appointment of clerks of works start?  I understand that only started one year ago and that it has not been done even with the new regulations.  It seems clear to met that Western Buildings Systems should be eliminated from public tendering for the moment.  The Minister is required to show significant or persistent deficiencies in the performance of a public contract to do this.  There is no doubt that it has reached that threshold.  Can the Minister confirm that the Statute of Limitations is not yet in force and that there is still a period in which to sue Western Building Systems and other professionals that may well be involved in negligence here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300037#KK00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1540318500,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister all the best in his new position.

Before I put the specifics on record, I assure the House that the health and safety of students and staff are of paramount importance and that any and all actions taken to date are predicated on ensuring their safety.  Ardgillan community college, Balbriggan, is a 1,000 pupil school under the patronage of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, with a current enrolment of 910 pupils.  Phase 1 of the school building was built in 2009 as a design and build contract completed on behalf of my Department by Western Building Systems.  This was followed by phase 2 in 2015, which was delivered by a different contractor.  A fire safety assessment of phase 1 was carried out and necessary works were being undertaken to remediate issues discovered during the assessment.  During the course of these works additional issues of a structural nature were identified.  Opening up works in two classrooms took place last Friday and, following an inspection by a consultant engineer on behalf of DDLETB, significant structural issues were discovered.  Having considered the engineer&rsquo;s advice, and in the interests of the health and safety of the students and staff of the school, DDLETB in consultation with my Department and school management made the decision to close phase 1 of the school building immediately.<\/p>  <p>  A structural assessment was carried out today at Tyrrelstown Educate Together national school and at the adjoining St Luke&rsquo;s national school.  Some of the type of issues identified in Ardgillan community college were found and both schools are being closed as a precautionary measure to allow for further detailed investigations.  This development impacts 1,200 pupils and their parents.  I am aware that there are also two cr&egrave;ches on the same site.  My Department will work closely with the school authorities in respect of interim accommodation solutions for these pupils.  The target is to have interim accommodation solutions in place for the pupils as they return to school following the mid-term break.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department acknowledges the disruption that school closures have on families and parents and on the students and staff of the affected school.  They will be kept fully up to date with developments.  We will have a direct line of communication from the Department for the schools.  To update the House, every school in the original bundle of 30 was contacted by the Department today.  As a result of the news this evening, the Department now intends to conduct structural assessments on all remaining schools constructed by Western Building Systems.  We are going to do structural assessments on all of them, even those built post 2014 after the building control regulations came in.  This involves some 40 schools in total.  These initial structural assessments have been commenced this week as a matter of urgency.  We will continue to do that this week and next week at a very fast rate and with great urgency.  School authorities will continue to be kept fully informed of developments.  We will also outline a timeline and chronology of the order in which schools will be contacted and assessed tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies that at all times the key priority of my Department is the health and safety of students and staff.  I also want to provide assurances that every effort will be made, working closely with local authorities and communities, to identify solutions that will provide alternative accommodation for the students until matters have been resolved with their permanent school buildings.  On the question of when we seek to have students back in Ardgillan community college, we hope to have them back in the week after the mid-term break, that is Monday week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300037#KK00700","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1540318500,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I noted that a decade had passed since the financial crisis.  In a dynamic and ever-changing global environment, the Irish economy continues to strengthen and grow.  A record number of our citizens have jobs.  Our public finances are balanced.  We have made progress and the darkest of days have passed.  The House will be aware of the many risks that remain from abroad, for example as we confront the great challenge that is Brexit, and of the many social challenges we face across our country, the needs we have to respond to in terms of shelter and housing and the further progress we need to make with regard to public services.  All of these are reasons why we need to continue to enhance the underlying strength and resilience of our economy.  In order to build this resilience, we must continue to manage our public finances responsibly and keep our tax base broad, stable and sustainable.  <\/p>  <p>  When I made my budget statement two weeks ago, I said budget 2019 was designed to secure our future.  It is a progressive budget with an emphasis on strengthening our national finances.  It aims to be responsible, to reflect a modern and caring Ireland and to position us well at the centre of a changing world.  Many of the changes required by the budget are contained in the Finance Bill 2018.  I will shortly set out the Bill in more detail but first I will look at some of the key themes running through it.<\/p>  <p>  The Finance Bill delivers on our commitment to continue to make targeted changes to the income tax system within available resources and make steady and sustainable progress in reducing the income tax burden, focusing on low and middle income earners.  To ease this burden, the Bill will increase the entry point to the higher rate of income tax for all earners by &euro;750, raising it to &euro;35,300 in the case of a single worker.  The third rate of the universal social charge will be reduced from 4.75% to 4.5%.  As I said on budget day, the Government believes that workers enter the higher rate of income tax at too low a level of income.  The impact of these changes means the top marginal rate on incomes up to &euro;70,000 will be reduced to 48.5% and fewer people on incomes around the national average will have any income subject to the 40% rate of income tax.  The Bill will also provide for a modest increase in the ceiling of the second USC rate band from &euro;19,372 to &euro;19,874 to take account of changes in the minimum wage.  I am also happy to confirm an increase in the home carer credit of &euro;300.  This brings the value of the credit to &euro;1,500 per year and is expected to benefit around 85,000 working families.  For self-employed workers, the earned income credit will be increased by a further &euro;200.  To support the single affordable childcare scheme, I propose to amend section 194A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to ensure that payments to childcare providers under the scheme do not give rise to tax liabilities for the parents.  It is not my intention that payments under the scheme should give rise to tax liabilities for parents or guardians.<\/p><p>In the absence of any legislative relieving provisions, the payments made under the scheme would be taxable, as they are made on behalf of the parent or guardian as a contribution towards the cr&egrave;che fees.  The effect of the proposal will also be retroactive to ensure payments made under similar administrative schemes are also exempt.<\/p> <p> The Bill contains a number of measures relating to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, the employment and investment incentive, EII, and the start-up refunds for entrepreneurs, SURE, which seek to advance the enterprise agenda.  The take-up of KEEP has been limited and, therefore, I intend to double the ratio of share options to salary and increase the total value of options from &euro;250,000 to &euro;300,000.  The company can currently grant options to the particular employee or director up to a maximum of &euro;250,000 in any three-year period.  I propose to change while keeping the &euro;3 million overall limit for companies.  Employees will not be restricted from entering into future KEEP arrangements with future employers. <\/p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, I asked my Department to arrange a comprehensive review of these incentives with a focus on their efficiency and effectiveness.  Having considered the recommendations contained in the recent report by Indecon economic consultants, I propose a package of measures.  First, I propose changes to the application procedure for the incentives to a largely self-certification model.  This should address the most significant problem with the current design of the scheme relating to delays in the application process.  While primarily self-assessment, it is important to note that under the proposed new arrangements, companies may ask Revenue to confirm that they have met the requirements for general block exemption regulation compliance.  This is a fair support for many companies and investors given that they may not be familiar with EU state aid rules.<\/p> <p> Second, the new text also provides for a specific investor eligibility regime for investment in small enterprises through the start-up capital incentive.  In particular, and in accordance with EU state aid rules, connected persons are permitted greater freedom to invest in limited amounts in small start-ups.<\/p> <p> Third, the section includes a substantial consolidation and updating of the current text of Part 16 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The aim is to make the scheme more intelligible for stakeholders.  In addition, the draft brings forward a number of technical adjustments to the incentives, which seek to simplify and clarify the legislative provisions.  It also includes an anti-avoidance measure where, in the case that a holding company sells a subsidiary and the money is returned to the holding company, the holding company must return the capital to the investors immediately rather than, as at present, being able to retain the proceeds for the remainder of the four years without triggering a clawback of relief.<\/p> <p> Finally, in light of the substantial review just undertaken, I also propose to extend EII and SURE by an additional year to the end of 2021, which is consistent with the procedures set out in my Department's tax expenditure guidelines.  I intend that other issues raised in the lndecon report will be addressed in a subsequent finance Bill.<\/p> <p> In the film industry, the film tax credit acts as a stimulus to the development of an indigenous audiovisual industry to support the expression of Irish culture and the creation of high-quality employment opportunities in the State.  The relief is scheduled to end in 2020 but I propose a four-year extension of the credit until December 2024 to provide certainty to this important part of our economy.  To support the development of the sector beyond the current established hubs, I also propose to introduce, subject to state aid approval, a new, short-term regional uplift for certain productions made in areas designated under the state aid regional guidelines.  The regional uplift will commence at 5% and will be phased out over four years on a tiered basis.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that income volatility is a significant difficulty for farming families and that 2018 is turning out to be a particularly difficult year.  I propose to make the income averaging scheme available to a greater range of farms.  Income averaging allows eligible farmers to calculate their taxable income as the average of their income in the current year and the previous four years, on a rolling basis, thus smoothing their tax liability over a five-year period.  I propose to extend the income averaging scheme to farmers with self-employed, off-farm income farmers whose spouses have self-employed, off-farm income, with averaging only applying in respect of farm profits, to ensure its availability to the entire sector.  In addition, the Bill renews for a further three years the 25% general stock relief on income tax, the 50% stock relief on income tax for registered farm partnerships and the 100% stack relief on income tax for certain young trained farmers.<\/p> <p> Before I move on to other sections, I wish to address our commitment to the ongoing process of international tax reform.  In budget 2019, I announced the introduction of two new measures from the anti-tax avoidance directive, ATAD, namely, an ATAD-compliant tax regime and new controlled foreign company, CFC, rules, which are designed to prevent the artificial diversion of profits to offshore entities in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions.  The new ATAD-compliant tax regime will impose a charge to tax at 12.5% on unrealised gains where companies migrate or transfer assets offshore in order that they leave the scope of Irish tax.  It replaces a pre-existing focused anti-avoidance exit charge with a new, broad-based exit tax.  The introduction of both these measures, in addition to the commitments to further action set out in the corporation tax roadmap published in September, clearly demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that Ireland's tax regime is stable, legitimate and transparent, to support continuing investment and job creation in the State.<\/p> <p> I wish to outline key elements of the Bill, although Deputies will appreciate that in the limited time available, it will not be possible to cover every section.  Part 1 deals with the universal social charge, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.<\/p> <p> Sections 2 to 5, inclusive, deal with the income tax measures I have outlined.<\/p> <p> Section 9 extends the benefit-in-kind, BIK, exemption for electric vehicles until 31 December 2021 to support policies to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector.  Having regard to value for money and tax equity considerations, it also applies a cap of &euro;50,000 on this exemption such that an electric vehicle with an original market value exceeding this limit will be subject to BIK taxation on the amount in excess of &euro;50,000.  <\/p> <p> Under section 14, I propose amending section 205A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to extend the same tax treatment for awards under the restorative justice process to women who were resident in institutions associated with the Magdalen laundries.<\/p> <p> Section 15 is a technical amendment, while section 16 introduces new accelerated capital allowances for gas-propelled vehicles and refuelling equipment, which I signalled in my Budget Statement.<\/p> <p> Section 17 amends and commences a relief, introduced last year in Finance Bill 2017, subject to a commencement order, which allows a benefit to employers who incur capital costs on equipment or buildings used for the purposes of providing childcare services or fitness facilities to employees.<\/p> <p> Section 20 relates to the relief available to certain start-up companies in their first three years of trading.  Following a review performed by my Department, I will extend the relief for a further three years to 31 December 2021.<\/p> <p>  Section 21 proposes that the amount of interest paid in respect of loans used to purchase, improve or repair a residential property that may be deducted by landlords will be increased to 100% from 1 January 2019.  This change is an acceleration of the rate of the restoration of the full value of this relief.<\/p> <p> Section 23 relates to ELI and SURE, section 24 deals with film relief and section 25 deals with CFCs, which I outlined earlier.<\/p><p>Section 28 amends section 603A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Broadly, this provides relief from capital gains tax on the transfer of a site by a parent or civil partner to a child of the parent or a child of the civil partner, where the transfer is to enable the child to construct his or her principal private residence on the site.  The section is being amended to allow both a child and his or her spouse or civil partner to benefit from the relief available under the section.<\/p> <p> Section 31 amends the definition of a \"sugar sweetened drink\" to ensure that certain categories of beverages will be subject to sugar sweetened drinks tax where they do not meet a minimum calcium content of 119 mg per 100 ml.  The amendment fulfils the commitment made to the European Commission as part of the formal EU state aid notification process for sugar-sweetened drinks tax.<\/p> <p> Section 32 confirms the budget increases in the rates of tobacco products tax and minimum excise duty for cigarettes in support of public health policy.  Section 33 provides for an increase in the rate of betting duty and betting intermediary duty with effect from 1 January 2019.  The rate of betting duty is increased from 1% to 2% for bookmakers and remote bookmakers while betting intermediary duty is increased from 15% to 25%.<\/p> <p> Section 35 provides for a vehicle registration tax, VRT, surcharge of 1% on diesel cars in recognition of growing air pollution concerns from pollutants emitted in high amounts by diesel vehicles.  Section 37 extends the VRT relief for hybrid electric vehicles until 31 December 2019 in support of climate change policy.<\/p> <p> Section 41 gives effect to the budget increase in the VAT rate applying to tourism activities, with services and goods currently applying at 9% increasing to 13.5% from 1 January 2019, with the exception of newspapers and sports facilities.  This section also provides for a reduction in VAT on digital publications from 23% to 9%.<\/p> <p> Section 46 provides for the extension for a further three years to 31 December 2021 of the young trained farmers' stamp duty relief which I announced in budget 2019.  This extension must be notified to the EU authorities and is therefore being made subject to a commencement order.  This section also contains amendments to ensure a number of stamp duty related provisions in the legislation comply with EU state aid regulations and reflect current practice.<\/p> <p> Section 47 provides for taxpayers having a right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners against a decision made by Revenue in relation to a claim for a repayment of stamp duty which is not currently provided for in the legislation.  Part 5 of the Bill deals with capital acquisitions tax, CAT, and includes section 50 which amends the dwelling house exemption to ensure that properties which have been placed in a discretionary trust are brought within the assessment criteria for determining if the beneficiary meets the conditions to qualify for the exemption.<\/p> <p> Section 51 addresses my budget announcement to increase the group A tax-free threshold which applies to gifts and inheritances from parents to their children from &euro;310,000 to &euro;320,000.  This will apply to gifts or inheritances received on or after 10 October.<\/p> <p> Part 6 of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters and here I want to mention that section 53 makes a number of technical amendments to facilitate the operation of the tax appeals process.<\/p> <p> As is customary with the Finance Bill, there are still a small number of matters under consideration that I may bring forward on Committee Stage and, of course, I will also consider any suggestions put forward during our debate over the next couple of days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300038#LL01200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540320300,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2018.  At the outset, it is worth reminding ourselves what the passing of the Finance Bill means.  Along with the Social Welfare Bill, it ensures financial stability over the next 12 months.  Indeed, it was with that same purpose that Fianna F&aacute;il approached discussions for this third budget under the confidence and supply arrangement.  As in 2016 in the aftermath of the election we recognised that Ireland needed political stability to properly face a more politically unstable world.  If we were to have the instability that Sinn F&eacute;in crave we, as a country, would be in no position to have our voices heard in Brexit negotiations.  There would be nobody to articulate the Irish perspective on this crucial period in European history.  I am left questioning whether this is its preferred position as it fails to take responsibility in the Northern Ireland Assembly, fails to take responsibility in Westminster and fails to take responsibility here, as in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il does not shirk its responsibility.  This budget was certainly not one that we would have written and it is fair to say it is not one we wholly agree with, but it is one where we had an impact, an effect and delivered a change in direction.  This budget has followed the previous two budgets in that it is broadly progressive.  Under this budget, the burden is lightened for those less well off.  This is as it should be and it stands in stark contrast to the successive regressive budgets imposed under the last Government that were so decisively rejected in the election of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Core to that progressivity and consequently to the confidence and supply arrangement is the principle that available Exchequer funds should be split two to one in favour of investment in vital public services over tax cuts.  The reality has been that for the last two budgets the ratio has been closer to three to one and this budget has been more like four to one.  This is a far cry from the budget of 2016 which was opportunistic in nature and designed to woo the electorate.  The electorate was having none of it for it knew the country was crying out for investment in public services and that the recovery was not being felt by all.<\/p>  <p>  From a fiscal perspective, the situation has undoubtedly improved but it would be a huge mistake to assume we are out of the woods.  Key vulnerabilities exist.  We are still running a deficit despite where the economy is in the business cycle which is a risky strategy by any measure.  Two thirds of the adjustments required were put in place by the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Ever since, the final third has proved elusive for this Government.  We are still projected to borrow money next year to pay for the services the public requires despite the fast pace of economic growth and the extraordinary explosion on corporation tax receipts.<\/p>  <p>  It is for this reason that Fianna F&aacute;iI called for the establishment of the rainy day fund.  I welcome the legislation published earlier today and we will engage constructively to ensure the legislation gets through efficiently.  When the next downturn comes, we do not want to see tax increases and cuts in public services to be the only option on the table.  We do not want to be in a position where the Government of the day raids private pensions.  A sound fiscal policy based on balanced budgets and an appropriately funded rainy day fund will offer flexibility in those future circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  There are those in this House who offer an alternative - spend more and ignore all the economists and economic commentators by not establishing a rainy day fund.  With a national debt of over &euro;200 billion, nearly &euro;43,000 per household this is downright irresponsible.  What would Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party do in the event of a downturn?  Would they turn to the international markets?  This week we have seen the market reaction to Italy&rsquo;s policy.  Would they run to Europe for help again?  I fear this would fall on deaf ears.  Unquestionably, their policy to borrow more now and to leave no fiscal buffer whatsoever would leave Ireland hugely exposed.  Put simply, they would have to raise taxes and cut spending.  This, in effect, is what they are calling for.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit continues to be the most serious challenge Ireland faces.  The prolonged political turmoil and the political uncertainty that has come with it remains a dark shadow over Ireland&rsquo;s economic prospects.  We are now almost five months from Brexit and yet we are no clearer on whether an agreement will be reached and what that agreement will entail.  We support the Government in their negotiations and we hope the best deal possible can be achieved come March 2019.  It is critical that a hard border is not established on this island and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected.  However, I have serious concerns about the Government&rsquo;s readiness at home and it would be remiss of me and my party to simply ignore them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government deceived itself and others that the backstop was guaranteed and that Northern Ireland would be protected.  Instead of engaging with opposite numbers in the UK and Northern Ireland, the Government chose to go on an all-out spin offensive.<\/p><p>The result has left Ireland and Irish businesses dangerously exposed.  We now know that only a third of the required customs officials will be operating by 29 March 2019.  This is based on a transitional arrangement which is growing more unlikely by the day.  The Government will not tell us exactly how many officials will be needed if a no-deal Brexit were to become a reality.  Businesses up and down the country are crying out for support but the Government has failed to hear them.  We regularly hear announcements about Brexit support schemes, but precious little follows.  For the much lauded Brexit loan scheme only ten companies have reached the sanction at finance provider stage.  Only 127 companies have availed of the \"Be Prepared\" grants from Enterprise Ireland, and 160 have received Intertrade Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit readiness vouchers.  Only 47 market discovery grants have been issued by Enterprise Ireland, and most shockingly of all, given the vulnerability of the agri-food sector, the low-cost loan scheme for farmers and fishermen, announced last year, has not even been established.  It shows that the Government is not supporting business.  It has announced many initiatives and we acknowledge that, but those schemes have failed to deliver any significant impact.  The schemes that do get established are overly burdensome and complex.  Many businesses simply do not have the resources or the time to apply for them.  The Government needs to address this matter urgently.<\/p> <p> While Fianna F&aacute;il entered into the confidence and supply arrangement to provide stability it would be a lie and it would be disingenuous to suggest that it has been plain sailing.  The crises in housing and health continue to be stains on our society, with thousands of people homeless, including children, and tens of thousands lying on hospital waiting lists.  Housing is the key test for this budget and this Government.  Instead of focussing on glossy reports and fancy announcements the Government simply needs to build social and affordable housing.  The dire record of Fine Gael on the provision of adequate affordable housing for citizens must be put right.  Now is the time for real ambition and genuine delivery.  The &euro;60 million announced to tackle the homelessness crisis is welcome, but is belated.  We should not have to wait until almost 4,000 children are homeless before action is taken.  Local authorities must be given far more autonomy to build social housing.  The cutting of red tape should help in that regard.  Young people aspiring to settle down and have kids are finding it harder and harder to get on the housing ladder.  The &euro;100 million fund for the building of affordable housing will help, but as always with this Government, implementation is key.<\/p> <p> Turning to the Finance Bill, it is regrettable and short-sighted that we have seen little movement on private landlords.  They are leaving the market in their droves; some 2,000 were lost this year alone, meaning at least 2,000 houses are lost to the system at a time of grave urgency and crisis.  There is no move in this Bill on mortgage interest relief for landlords who facilitate long-term leases.  I will engage with the Government to bring in such amendments at Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> On health, we welcome the further funding given to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, but it must be said that it is modest when compared to the crisis we face.  As public expenditure spokesperson I have to highlight the long-term funding issues facing the health Vote.  For the past number of years we have seen the HSE demand extra funding to stand still, a fraction of that amount being offered on budget day, followed by overspending the following year and a subsequent supplemental payment for health at the end of the year.  This carousel approach to budgeting will have a detrimental impact on the state of our health services for decades to come.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report sets out a sustainable pathway forward for our public health service, yet the Government has failed to give it the backing it needs.  Without financial foundation I fear the Sl&aacute;intecare report will not do what it says on the tin.<\/p> <p> The confidence and supply arrangement clearly states that cuts to the universal social charge ought to be directed at low and middle income earners.  This was in recognition that low and middle income earners were not feeling the recovery the Government was telling them was happening.  The changes made this year are modest but when added together to the changes in the previous two budgets they are more significant.  I acknowledge that without indexing our tax system almost 80,000 workers will face a natural tax increase next year.  The marginal band needs to be changed in recognition of that fact.  However, the increases in the home carer and earned income tax credit could be more generous.  Progress has been made, but I feel it is time that the self-employed are given an equal credit to PAYE workers in recognition of the risk they take.  I would prefer to see a &euro;2,000 home carer&rsquo;s credit in recognition of the huge services they provide to children and those living with disabilities.  The income tax changes taken together are modest but they are necessary to keep our tax system competitive.<\/p> <p> Keeping our competitiveness in mind, our small businesses and enterprises need far more support.  I have spoken already about how exposed our SMEs are to the impacts of Brexit.  There are similar problems when it comes to enterprise taxes.  There has been no movement yet again on capital gains tax, CGT, for entrepreneurs.  Our CGT rate of 33% is far in excess of our main competitors, so much so that businesses and SMEs are struggling to get the credit and finance they require to grow and create jobs.  The take up of the employment incentive and investment scheme, EIIS, and the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, has fallen far short of where it needs to be.  I welcome the changes in the Finance Bill in this regard, but I wonder if these changes tackle the complexity of these schemes.  We commit to working with the members of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, to make sure that the changes we make to the KEEP and EIIS schemes help in that regard.  I welcome the extension of the tax relief for start-up companies until the end of 2021.<\/p> <p> I must take the opportunity to highlight the lack of movement on the exit tax both in the budget and the Finance Bill.  Typically the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, rate was linked to the exit tax rate on the early extraction of pension funds.  While I understand and acknowledge the need for an exit tax I do believe it is unfair to overly tax such extractions, especially when money is needed for serious health expenses for an individual or loved one.  I urge the Minister to look at this and at the very least to equalise the exit tax with DIRT.<\/p> <p> The Minister announced on budget day that he was increasing the betting tax from 1% to 2% on amounts wagered in the State and that the betting duty on the commission earned by betting intermediaries will be increased from 15% to 25%.  Healthy gambling is enjoyed by thousands of people around the country, but it would be wrong to ignore the fact that gambling addiction is a serious blight on our society.  In this light I encourage the Government to look at independent bookmakers who will be put under real pressure because of this change.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to deal with problem gambling and its delay in bringing in any meaningful regulation in this regard must be addressed.  The gambling control Bill passed way back in 2013 has yet to be implemented.  If this Government is serious about problem gambling it would put the right regulation in place to tackle the problem.<\/p> <p> Climate change is the challenge of our generation.  Ireland cannot relinquish its responsibility in this regard.  We signed up to the Paris Agreement and are accountable to European regulations.  Sadly, this Government will see the targets outlined in both missed by quite a long way.  It is shameful that the national development plan was not climate proofed before it was published.  I am disappointed that the Government has not done more work on carbon tax.  In the context of imminent announcements from Bord na M&oacute;na on the progress made on its decarbonisation programme and job losses in the midlands region which will affect families and whole communities, the Government cannot sit on its hands and do nothing.  I have written to the Taoiseach about this matter, requesting that he set up a just, sustainable forum for the area, funded from the carbon tax take and possibly by funding from the EU, which can distribute funds where over 500 jobs are lost in a region, to help and assist the stakeholders involved and the communities affected, the representatives of those communities and the relevant Departments.  We have to ensure that there are alternatives, that innovation and enterprise is rewarded and that those regions have a future in a decarbonised world via the provision of alternative forms of energy, which the midlands has been synonymous with for many years.  While I acknowledge that increasing carbon tax would essentially increase the cost of motoring, we cannot simply ignore it.  We need to agree a path forward similar to Sl&aacute;intecare on how to address this fundamental challenge.  The benefit in kind extension for electric vehicles and the charging of those vehicles is welcome.  However, I must ask the Minister why a cap of &euro;50,000 on the original market value was put in place.  The only viable electric cars on the market currently are expensive by their very nature and I fear that this change will leave many with no alternative but to get rid of their electric vehicles.<\/p> <p> The mortgage arrears crisis continues to be a major issue facing thousands of families across the country.<\/p><p>Banks in response to pressure from the ECB are selling their distressed loans to vulture funds.  The Government seems to think this is the only solution to the mortgage arrears crisis.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Banks should not be outsourcing their dirty work to vultures.  Instead, they should be working through their loan books.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has been particularly active in this regard.  Our Bill to establish a mortgage resolution office still requires a money message from the Government.  This Bill would remove the bank veto.  We introduced legislation to regulate vulture funds.  I acknowledge the Government's support for this Bill and the work done by officials in the Department of Finance.  My point, however, is that there is not simply one solution to mortgage arrears.  By putting in place modern and fair laws to deal with mortgage arrears, we will provide sustainable solutions to genuine arrears cases leaving strategic defaulters at the mercy of the courts.<\/p> <p> The Government has done precious little when it comes to high mortgage interest rates.  Its response has been the same as always, the market will sort it out.  The market, however, has not sorted it.  Irish customers pay higher interest rates than Greek customers.  I refuse to believe an Irish mortgage is more risky than a Greek mortgage.  Caps have been imposed in many eurozone countries and the sky has not fallen in.  No progress has been made to ban cash-back offers, which serve to only cloud the judgment of customers.<\/p> <p> No movement has been made to better enable credit unions, either individually or collectively, to enter the mortgage market to introduce much-needed competition in this area.  An Post is planning to enter the market, which is to be welcomed, but I fear this will be to the detriment of the credit union sector.  No movement has been made in establishing special purpose vehicles to enable the credit union movement to invest in social and affordable housing.  The Government has relinquished all responsibility for such an initiative, apart from allowing them to create their own vehicles as one credit union body is in the process of doing.  Credit unions offer essential services to local communities in towns and villages across the country.  Their viability and future is paramount to vibrant communities.  Many of these credit unions will fail, however, if they are not allowed to lend on a longer more profitable basis.  This will be yet another blow to rural Ireland.<\/p> <p> The explosion of corporation tax receipts, while positive in the short term, represents an ever increasing risk to the Exchequer.  If just a handful of major companies change their structures and move activity and assets out of Ireland, the State will lose billions of euro in tax revenue.  On another front, we have to be prepared to protect our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  We must resist European efforts to establish a digital tax and a common consolidated corporate tax base proposal.  However, we must engage and co-operate with both our European and OECD colleagues to ensure there is fair and transparent global tax regime whereby companies cannot hide tax revenue in tax havens.  In this context, I welcome our co-operation with the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  I acknowledge the changes made in this Finance Bill in this regard.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, has consistently highlighted the significant issues facing the Tax Appeals Commission and the backlog in appeals.  An open and transparent tax appeals regime is crucial for businesses.  We need a consistent and fair tax system.  It is vital the issues in the Tax Appeals Commission are tackled and the backlog is reduced.<\/p> <p> In increasing the VAT rate for the tourism sector, the Government put many companies around the country under pressure.  While Dublin-based hotels are booming, the same cannot be said for many outside the city.  I urge the Government to look at supports for that sector to ensure these VAT changes do not represent the death knell for these smaller establishments.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has honoured its side of the confidence and supply arrangement.  We will not vote for this budget but we will facilitate its passage.  This budget is fairer because of confidence and supply and the influence that Fianna F&aacute;il has had on it.  We need action now from the Government in the area of housing and health, as well as no more spin but real action.  We will engage constructively on Committee Stage with all Members in order to tackle some of the issues outlined.  We look forward to bringing forward amendments and discussing them and others on Committee Stage in order that we arrive at a conclusion which will have the effect we desire for our State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300040#NN00200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540321500,"counter":413,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as an deis labhairt ar an Bhille Airgeadais anseo inniu.

He is never one to try and stick the boot in although it is acknowledged by the Government that Sinn F&eacute;in is being proactive and supportive in this regard.  I remember he was one of the Fianna F&aacute;il Members who voted in its last Ard-Fheis for an electronic and frictionless Border with automatic logging of all trade between Ireland, the North and Britain.  This is very much akin to Jacob Rees-Mogg's and Theresa May's plans that everybody else throughout Europe has criticised.  Maybe Deputy Cowen is more in line with his party's councillor from Louth who has been calling publicly for a hard border.  Sometimes, it is hard to figure out which way Fianna F&aacute;il is blowing on these issues.  One thing for sure is that they will try and stick the boot into somebody, despite the ramifications Brexit could have on my constituency, the Border counties and the entire island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As usual, our hands are tied with the Finance Bill because of the prohibition of putting down substantial amendments that may have a cost on the Exchequer.  That archaic ruling, based on the Constitution and Standing Orders, needs to be removed to ensure the Finance Bill debate can become a real one.  We should be allowed to put down substantial amendments, which will not be ruled out of order, and discuss them to improve and strengthen the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  This was a bad budget.  It is not what Ireland needs at this point and reinforces the mistakes made over the past several years by eroding the tax income base while other sustainable avenues for revenue, such as wealth, profits and higher incomes, were not tapped into.  In the meantime, the books are balanced only by what everybody recognises as temporary, namely, corporation tax receipts.  There was nothing of significance in the budget that screamed that it was for a country facing the uncertainty of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Much of what we have seen with this budget is similar to what happened during the Charlie McCreevy era.  Deputy Cowen should look at what happened at that time.  We had to take lectures from Fianna F&aacute;il about responsibility this evening.  This is the party that used to give standing ovations to its Minister of Finance as he cut the legs from under people, cut the blind pension, sent countless families to airports to say good-bye to their emigrating sons and daughters and destroyed the potential of local communities.  That is the responsibility on which the Deputy lectured me today.<\/p>  <p>  Did we have a rainy day fund in the time of Fianna F&aacute;il?  Yes, it was called the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Did we have balanced books and surpluses?  Yes we did and we will have the same in the next several years.  Did we cut income taxes at that point in time?  Yes we did, just as we are doing now.  Did the total amount of income tax actually increase year-on-year during that period?  Yes it did just as it is now.  Did we have an unreliable tax base that was balancing the books and creating a surplus?  Yes.  It was stamp duty then; now, it is corporation tax.  That is why what is happening now is similar to what happened in the past.  The crisis will never present itself in the exact same way but there are serious questions as to what we are doing in this Finance Bill by following the mistakes of the past.<\/p>  <p>  There was nothing in this budget which showed we learned from our past mistakes.  There was nothing in this budget for renters, the low paid or those living week to week.  Income tax and USC cuts this year will amount to &euro;284 million.  That is &euro;284 million that the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il say is not needed for our health services, childcare or building houses for those who are homeless or on the waiting lists.  In the three Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael confidence and supply budgets, &euro;750 million in tax cuts have been made to the most sustainable type of tax we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300042#PP00200","speaker":"1288"}]
