We have voted in support of this resolution on all of the 26 previous occasions that it has been put forward by Cuba. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on the United States&rsquo; trade embargo of Cuba is long-standing and clear. We believe that the embargo serves no constructive purpose.  Ireland, along with the other member states of the EU, is firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the Cuban economy to the benefit of the Cuban people. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland objects to unilaterally imposed measures that impede the economic and commercial relations of EU member states with Cuba and that are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade. Ireland believes that the economic embargo seriously hampers the economic development of Cuba and negatively affects its people.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland looks forward to receiving the draft resolution from Cuba on 31 October this year, and will review and consider the resolution as on the previous 26 occasions.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as bilateral engagement with Cuba, Ireland also engages with Cuba by way of the EU-Cuba relationship. The EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement marks an important point in this relationship.  The Agreement is the EU&rsquo;s first bilateral agreement with Cuba, and will improve conditions for EU-Cuba trade and investment.  The EU is Cuba&rsquo;s second most important trading partner, Cuba&rsquo;s biggest external investor and the source of one third of the 3.5 million tourists visiting the island each year.  <\/p>  <p>  I view the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement as an important step in further developing our relationship with Cuba. While most of the agreement has been provisionally applied since November 2017, its full application requires ratification by the EU once all member States have completed their own internal legal procedures.  As of now, fourteen member states have notified that they have done so. On the bilateral front, Ireland and Cuba will meet for Political Consultations on 1 October in Dublin.  We are in the process of completing our own internal legal procedures, and the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement will be brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for ratification once it has been debated by the Select Committee of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Seeking to move pension funds or PRSAs overseas in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which they were approved by Revenue and that this could result in the withdrawal of approval, the effect of which would be the claw back of the tax relief previously given.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in an ongoing review of the area of pension transfers abroad in conjunction with Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the Pensions Authority with a view to establish potential additional safeguards in this area. <\/p>  <p>As set out in A Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018&ndash;2023   published last February, the Government is currently reviewing the Pensions system more generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[38407\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the anticipated changes in the volume of tax collected as a result of the modernisation of the PAYE system from 2019 on the basis of no other changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>Budget 2018 included provision for an additional &euro;50 million in Income Tax receipts during 2018 arising from preparations for PAYE Modernisation, which is scheduled for implementation on 1 January 2019.

However, they have provided the following general information in relation to the administration and audit of claims for the film tax credit under Section 481, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 481, in general terms a company which produces a film can claim a payable tax credit of 32% of the lower of:<\/p>  <p>  (a) the eligible expenditure incurred on producing a film,<\/p>  <p>  (b) 80% of the total cost of production of the film, or<\/p>  <p>  (c) &euro;70 million per film.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum credit a company can claim in respect of a film is therefore &euro;22.4 million.<\/p>  <p>  Eligible expenditure is the amount that the producer company spends in Ireland, wholly and exclusively on producing the film.  Amounts spent on the film outside of Ireland do not qualify for the tax credit.  However, where the credit is calculated based on 80% of the total cost of production, Revenue must have regard to the amounts incurred outside of the State as an increased global budget can lead to an increased credit.<\/p>  <p>  The company that claims the credit must be an Irish producer company.  The Irish work on the film must be carried out by a special purpose company which is wholly owned by that Irish producer company.  Where the film is not a fully Irish production, for example where it is a multi-jurisdictional production or a co-production, the Irish producer company will often organise the Irish production on behalf of an international production company.  In those cases, it is the international production company who has full knowledge of the global budget and of the make-up of the items in the Irish budget.  <\/p>  <p>  Recognising the potential risks presented, the administrative framework of the relief requires that a company&rsquo;s application for the credit must include:<\/p>  <p>  (a) an auditor&rsquo;s report detailing the eligible expenditure, the global budget and details of related party transactions, and<\/p>  <p>  (b) a solicitor&rsquo;s letter detailing that they have reviewed the legal agreements and that 68% of the funding has been lodged to the company&rsquo;s bank account (a requirement prior to Revenue releasing any amounts of the payable tax credit).<\/p>  <p>  The payable credit is available to a film that has been approved by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and which has been certified by Revenue.  Section 481 provides that Revenue may refuse to certify a film if they have reason to believe that the budget, or any part of the budget, is inflated.  They may also refuse to certify the film if they are not satisfied with the commercial rationale for the corporate structure used for financing, distribution and other similar activities.  As with all tax reliefs, the greatest risk of inflation is found in related party transactions including through corporate or financing structures that facilitate circular flows of cash.  <\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the time taken to process applications for relief under Section 481 has increased in the last year, largely due to increased scrutiny on the expenses included within the &ldquo;eligible spend&rdquo; in 481 applications.  As the relief was restructured in 2015 from an investor-based relief to a corporation tax credit, the first films which have been made under this new format relief were being completed in 2017, which is when Revenue were first able to review the actual spend on completed films and the amounts being included in the claims for relief, as signed off by the auditors.  The largest adjustments arising from this review process are in respect of inflated related party expenditures, and discussions are ongoing between my Department, Revenue and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to options to protect the Exchequer and give greater clarity to producers claiming the credit.<\/p>  <p>  The review of the film relief currently under way in my Department is a cost benefit analysis, due under the Tax Expenditure Review Guidelines.  The analysis is currently being finalised and is scheduled to be published on Budget day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Exemptions","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF04300"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[38460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of new and previously unused properties purchased from builders and developers between 1 January 2013 and to date in 2018, that are exempt from local property tax, LPT; the amount of LPT foregone in respect of these dwellings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[38461\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of properties that were self-built before and after 1 May 2013 and to date that are exempt from local property tax; the amount of tax foregone on these dwellings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[38462\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of properties that were self-built between 1 January and 1 May 2013 that are exempt from local property tax until the end of 2019, that are used as sole or main residences; the amount of LPT foregone on these types of dwellings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[38463\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500063#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of properties purchased in 2013 that are classified as main residences that are exempt from local property tax until the end of 2019; the amount of LPT foregone on these properties from 2013 to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 to 143, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) and Part 2 of the Act make provision for a number of LPT exemptions.

In last year&rsquo;s Budget I announced that in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment, mortgage interest relief for owner-occupiers would be extended on a tapered basis to end-2020 for the remaining recipients of the relief.  The process of phasing out mortgage interest relief for homeowners has been under way since 2009.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to mortgage holders that find themselves in mortgage difficulty, there are various supports available to them.  For example, the Abhaile service which was launched in October 2016 provides financial and legal advice and support to homeowners.  This Government funded mortgage arrears resolution service gives indebted borrowers access to State-funded panels of qualified and regulated financial or legal professionals to give advice and assistance on how to resolve their mortgage arrears via a voucher system.  The scheme has been very successful in helping those in long-term arrears and it is important to highlight that over 10,000 vouchers for consultations have issued since the scheme began in 2016.  It aims to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland continues to assist distressed borrowers by returning them to solvency.  In over 90% of Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) cases, debtors have been able to remain in their homes.  The latest Insolvency Services Statistical Report for Q2 2018 shows that over 981 new applications were received in the quarter.  This high level of new applications has been maintained in large part because of the Abhaile Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which is part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework provides protections to consumers whose loans are in mortgage arrears.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.  I have asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to ensure that it remains effective and I expect to receive a report from the Central Bank next month.<\/p>  <p>  The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme is a government initiative to help homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears.  To increase borrowers&rsquo; awareness and understanding of MTR a new dedicated mortgage to rent website, www.mortgagetorent.ie, has been developed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government together with the Housing Agency with input from the Abhaile Service and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500064#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rebates","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500064#WRG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[38761\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500064#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) can claim back VAT on security lighting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in accordance with the EU VAT Directive farmers may register for VAT or be treated as flat-rate farmers for VAT purposes.

Thus the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies, not dependent on any Government scheme and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.

My Department is strongly supportive of the promotion of positive mental health awareness in both primary and post-primary schools.  The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems including behavioural, emotional and social.<i><\/i><\/p><p>To support this holistic approach my Department has published a <i>Well-being Policy and Framework for Practice<\/i>(2018-2023) for all schools which will inform how schools can promote student well-being.  It is the Department&rsquo;s aim that by 2023 all schools and centres for education will have embedded a dynamic Well-being Promotion Process<b><i><\/i><\/b>which promotes a whole school preventative approach to the promotion of well-being with interventions at both universal and targeted levels.  This approach is the most beneficial evidence informed approach for schools in the promotion of mental health and the support for students with mental health difficulties.  The Well-being Policy includes an Implementation Plan with seven high level actions to support the realisation of the policy.  Actions 2, 3 and 4 below focus on the need for the training of teachers which will include work with schools to ensure those students with most needs, including mental health needs, receive the highest level of support.  It is intended to:<\/p><p>- Plan and provide for the national roll-out of a professional development process to facilitate all schools and centres for education to engage with and embed a Well-being Promotion Process which builds professional capacity and collaborative cultures in schools from 2018-2023.<\/p><p>- Provide for an aligned, comprehensive and easily accessible programme of support for all schools and centres for education to address school-identified Well-being Promotion Needs.<\/p><p>- Consider how the system is meeting current and future teachers&rsquo; learning needs relating to well-being promotion.  <\/p><p>Support for implementation of the national <i>Well-Being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) <\/i>is also encompassed within the <i>Well-being Policy and Framework for Practice<\/i>implementation<i>.  <\/i><\/p><p>Responsibility for provision of mental health services and counselling for young people lies with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  Schools are advised to identify supports and services that are available in their community, build relationships and agree referral pathways for students needing referral.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides psychological support and engages in collaborative work helping school staff in how to access appropriate mental health services.  Psychologists support schools in connecting with Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health services in relation to individual children and young people with mental health needs.  Psychologists support and encourage the establishment of referral and communication protocols between education and health services at local level and work with others to develop community based mental health promotion strategies. <\/p><p>NEPS also provides guidelines and resource materials for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect students and school staff. The guidelines <i>responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools<\/i>(2016) refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment.  It also outlines how schools can plan for crises.  The publication provides support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time with practical step-by-step guidance for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs.  The guidelines focus on alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community.  In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches.  NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at the schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff and students.<\/p><p>A Well-being Steering Committee is overseeing the implementation of the <i>Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice <\/i>within my Department.  It examines issues in relation to the co-ordination and aligning of the range of supports provided to schools in regard to well-being and mental health promotion.  This involves coordinating the liaison with other Departments and Government agencies. <\/p><p>The Policy includes a Well-being Implementation Plan and significant resources have been committed from  a number of sections of the Department.  NEPS capacity to enhance educational psychological service to schools has been increased through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists in the last academic year and a further 10 psychologists in 2018\/19.  The focus of part of this additional support, in the context of primary schools, is on extending the delivery of training in the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management Programme (IYTCM) and the Friends programmes to teachers in DEIS schools.  IYTCM aims to reduce behavioural difficulties and strengthen social and emotional competence in primary school-age children.  The Friends Programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in young people thus promoting mental health.  <\/p><p>The Department also works with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the Health Promoting Schools initiative, which is supported by the Health Service Executive.  This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing on whole-school level conditions that affect health and well-being of children and young people. <\/p><p>Finding new ways of tackling policy issues that are not the sole responsibility of any one Government Department or agency has been prioritised by Government.  My Department has been involved with the Taskforce on Youth Mental Health as part of the programme for Government.  One of the challenges of providing a coordinated, streamlined approach to mental health promotion is the fact that there are so many statutory and voluntary agencies\/services\/NGOs involved.  The Task Force was established to produce a series of action-focused recommendations to improve youth mental health.

Each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district, which they consider, based on census data and local knowledge, there exists a demand for more diversity in educational provision.  Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City\/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs.  ETBs, having analysed the survey results, draw up comprehensive reports on the position in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron\/landowner in the area (the Catholic Bishop in most cases) concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand.

Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no role in this regard. Similarly, the deployment of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the incident in question, I am advised by the Garda authorities that a removal was conducted on behalf of the property&rsquo;s owner, and was the subject of a High Court order directing people who had been occupying the premises to vacate it. The removal of individuals from the property was not conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but by a private firm acting for the owner of the premises on foot of this High Court Order. <\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that the role of the Garda&iacute; who were in attendance at the scene that evening was to facilitate the High Court order being carried out safely, to ensure public order and to facilitate peaceful protest. I understand that Community Garda&iacute; were deployed initially and were later supported by a Garda Public Order Unit. <\/p>  <p>  I note Commissioner Harris&rsquo;s recent statement in relation to the protest and he has requested a report from the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), to see what lessons can be learned from the event. I also note that the Policing Authority will be pursuing this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too. <\/p>  <p>  The right to protest is a fundamental one in any democracy, and one which must be protected and facilitated.  However, it is also a right that must be exercised peacefully and with respect for the rights of others. In this context, we must not lose sight of the fact that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were enforcing the law in what were very difficult circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been some disquiet about members of the Public Order Unit wearing hoods.  The Commissioner has said they should have been worn in conjunction with helmets and you will be familiar with public order police around the world wearing helmets in the course of their policing duties.<\/p>  <p>  It is a sad fact and a worrying development that Garda&iacute;, and particularly those who undertake public order policing, are frequently personally targeted and subjected to vile abuse and threats, particularly online.  At the protest itself, the Garda&iacute; were subject to sustained abuse, including in one incident, racist abuse, and I condemn that behaviour. Where behaviour crosses the line into criminality, it may be investigated but it would be preferable if the crime did not occur at all. I would appeal to people to recognise that Garda&iacute; simply doing their jobs should not be subjected to threats, intimidation or abuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500068#WRL04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500069#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[38350\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500069#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if and when a join spouse visa will be considered in the case of a person (details supplied); when documentation such as proof of Irish citizenship, original and translated marriage certificate and copies of state marriage certificate are likely to be returned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the visa application referred to was refused by the Visa Office in Dublin on 6 February 2017.

The purpose of the legislation is to provide new legal rights and obligations on the parties to a construction contract.  The Act imposes minimum contractual provisions in relation to payments, particularly the timing of payments and the parties to a relevant construction contract cannot opt out of the provisions of the legislation.  The Act also prohibits the practice of &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo;, except in the circumstance of a third party to a contract becoming insolvent.  <\/p>  <p>   The Act provides specific deadlines for a subcontractor to submit payment claim notices.

It stated that the aggregate level of vacancies for consultant posts at the end of 2017 and evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications, suggest a general difficulty recruiting consultants and that the two-tier pay system was among a number of factors raised with it as affecting recruitment.  It also stated that the policy responses it expected for new entrants across the public services generally would be unlikely to address the degree of pay differential which applied to new entrant consultants.  The Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address this difficulty. <\/p>  <p>  New entrant consultants&rsquo; are encompassed by the process announced yesterday for new entrants across the public service under Section 4 of the Public Service Stability Agreement and will benefit accordingly.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has noted the Commission's views that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential between pre-existing consultants and new entrant consultants.

Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time. A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements  in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons  with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out  by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.

Under this Plan the Children's Hospital Group used a combination of insourcing of surgical procedures within the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group (CHG) and the broader public hospital sector, as well as outsourcing initiatives, including private providers nationally and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the outsourcing initiative, two hospitals in the UK and two in Europe were engaged to undertake spinal fusion surgery. In 2017, 28 surgeries were completed in these hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has advised that as part of the outsourcing initiative this year families were offered the opportunity to have their children&rsquo;s surgery abroad but did not avail of the offer as they did not want to travel abroad. <\/p>  <p>  They further advise that one child did have their surgery abroad in 2018, this was scheduled to have taken place in late 2017 but it was deferred until 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has advised that as capacity has increased in its hospitals during 2018 there has not been the demand to send patients abroad for surgery.   <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the HSE operates the Cross-Border Directive (CBD) in Ireland.  Under the terms of the Directive, patients of an EU\/EEA Member State who meet the necessary criteria may opt to avail of healthcare provided under the legislation of their Member State of affiliation in another EU\/EEA Member State and be reimbursed the lesser of the cost of receiving the treatment abroad, or the cost in their own Member State. The HSE advise that Scoliosis surgery is not accessible via the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS). <\/p>  <p>  In 2017 waiting times for scoliosis related surgery reduced for the first time in a number of years.  This has continued in 2018 with the investment in paediatric orthopaedics this year, to include scoliosis services, which has already improved access for surgery and out-patient review to address the lengthy waiting times experienced by children and young people with scoliosis. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of investment is now starting to deliver results with a consistent reduction in waiting times being recorded.  The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group advise that already this year 319 spinal surgeries have been carried out and they are on course to meet the year of end target of 446 surgeries while at the same time dealing with the 291 children who have been added to the waiting list for scoliosis surgery this year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500075#WRS04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Obesity Strategy","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500075#WRS04400"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[38549\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500075#WRS04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made on the national roll-out of the no-fry zone in County Wicklow, which prevents the sale of fatty or fast food near schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":699,"content":"<p>The initiative that the Deputy has raised is relevant to the national Obesity Policy and Action Plan being implemented under the aegis of the Department of Health. <\/p><p>A Healthy Weight for Ireland&rsquo;, the Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP), was launched in September 2016 under the auspices of the Healthy Ireland agenda. <\/p><p>The OPAP covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. It must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this. <\/p><p>The policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. Under the Plan, a new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) was established in October 2017 under the Chair of the Department of Health. It is comprised of representatives from a range of Government Departments and Agencies - including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. <\/p><p>Step 2 of the OPAP is <i>Regulate for a healthier environment<\/i>. One of the Actions under this Step is to &quot;Develop guidelines and support material for those working in developing the built environment for urban development and planning in relation to reducing the obesogenic environment&quot;. The OPAP recognised that changing the obesogenic environment is a critical factor underpinning the success of maintaining the population at a healthy weight. The prevention approach aims to gradually change Ireland's food environment to one that facilitates consumption of healthier food and drinks and fosters active lifestyles. The OPAP acknowledged that food and retail outlets are more widely available now than every before and that this becomes important as children have discretionary income and may not follow the healthy eating guidelines. It therefore declared that it is important that the health input into the local area planning process is consistent and evidence based. <\/p><p>This area is being progressed through engagement with other Government Departments to support the work of stakeholders involved in planning and developing the built environment.<\/p><p>In line with Actions 31 and 59 of the National Physical Activity Plan, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity (31), and to develop a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement to ensure delivery of the Plan (59), it is intended to hold a Stakeholder Forum in November this year. The planned Forum will focus on the theme of the Built Environment.<\/p><p>Planning for the Forum is at an advanced stage, and a number of individuals - including key representation from the initiative referred to by the Deputy - have been approached with regard to giving presentations at the Forum. A wide range of stakeholders will be invited to the Forum, comprising key representatives from health, sport, planning, environment, local government and others. Full details of the Forum will be available once finalised. <\/p><p>Finally, the question of legislation around planning matters for the issue raised by the Deputy is ultimately a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government,  and I understand that he has addressed the position on this in his reply to Parliamentary Question 34831\/17.

Article 5 of the Directive provides for the exemplary role of public bodies buildings and includes achieving an annual rate of energy efficient renovation for Government buildings of 3%.  The directive allows for this to be achieved either through renovation or by &ldquo;alternative measures&rdquo;.  Ireland has chosen the alternative approach which entails a mix of energy management and efficiency upgrade measures.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has however set a more ambitious energy efficiency objective for our public sector.  When Government set our national 20% target the public sector (which includes schools and local authorities) was given a more ambitious target of 33% which goes beyond the 3% renovation requirement in the EU directive.  Progress has been good with a 20% improvement in energy efficiency achieved across the public sector by end 2016.  The cumulative savings from 2009 to 2016 amount to 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions reduction and &euro;737m in energy spend avoided.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of my own Department we achieved approximately 20% energy efficiency improvement by end 2016 with a 31% efficiency improvement over the same period for our group.  I am confident this performance will be further enhanced when the next performance report issues late this year.  Details of efficiencies achieved by all public bodies are available online in the Annual Report on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance available on the SEAI website.  <\/p>  <p>  To further drive the effort required to achieve the 33% target, I published the first Government approved Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy in 2017.  The Strategy introduces new governance structures and enhanced support measures, and provided clarity on the retention of financial savings achieved by public sector bodies from the energy efficiency measures they implement.  <\/p>  <p>  Since we launched the Strategy all government departments have appointed a designated Energy Performance Officer (EPO) to drive the Strategy and provide the necessary strategic leadership to the bodies within their groups.  My Department, along with the SEAI, and the OPW have been engaging pro-actively with Departments and their EPO&rsquo;s through workshops and individual advisory sessions.  The main focus is to support EPO's to work with the bodies in their sector to identify and develop energy efficiency projects and avail of the advice and supports available.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2017, I have provided &euro;14m in funding to the SEAI to engage and work with the OPW and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills on two pilot projects.  These are delivering energy retrofit upgrades, and crucially, informing and developing replicable and scalable models for energy retrofit investment that can be more widely deployed.  In parallel the SEAI is working with the higher education and healthcare sectors to develop significant projects and continues, along with my Department, to support the City &amp;amp; County Management Association in developing the National Public Lighting Upgrade Programme, which has the potential to more than halve local authority electricity use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500082#WRZ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":970,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500082#WRZ01000"},{"type":"question","counter":971,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[38451\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500082#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the Cumminstown area is included in the broadband roll-out proposed for the Ballynacargy area of County Westmeath.","asker":"1250","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":972,"content":"<p>According to my Departments High Speed Broadband Map, available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie,<\/i>there are 19 premises in the townland of Cumminstown in the Ballynacarrigy area, Co Westmeath.<\/p><p>Of these premises 2 are in the AMBER area of the map, and 17 are in the LIGHT BLUE area.<\/p><p>The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.

While there is an error in the legislation, it is not that suggested in the question.<\/p>  <p>  Drivers who fail an impairment test will be arrested under section 4 or section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  These sections deal respectively with intoxication offences related to driving and being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle.  <\/p>  <p>  The actual error in the legislation relates to the substitution of section 11 of the 2010 Act - the section which is the basis for impairment testing - in the Road Traffic Act 2016.  Section 11 empowers Garda&iacute; to conduct impairment tests and makes it an offence if a person, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a requirement to undergo an impairment test.  The section empowers Garda&iacute; to arrest without warrant a person guilty of failing to comply with such a request.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty arises because the 2016 revision of section 11 changed the internal numbering of subsections.  The power of arrest for someone who failed to comply with a request to conduct an impairment test was originally in section 11(5) and is now in section 11(6).  References elsewhere in the legislation to procedure following arrest under section 11(5) should now refer to procedure following arrest under section 11(6).<\/p>  <p>  References in sections 13A and 13B to section 11(5) were corrected to refer to section 11(6) by section 2(a) and (b) of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018, which will be commenced on 26 October.  These will allow Garda&iacute; to conduct preliminary oral fluid tests for drugs and evidential blood tests for drugs where people have been arrested under section 11(6).<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, it has been noted that similar changes will be required to references in section 12 - obligation to provide blood, breath or urine specimens following arrest - and section 16 - power to detain people after arrest where they might pose a danger to themselves or others.  These will be corrected in the forthcoming Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, it is important to note that a person convicted under section 11 for failure to comply with a request to undergo and impairment test is liable to a fine up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 and\/or up to six months in prison.  They will also be subject to a consequential disqualification of at least 1 year.  It is not therefore the case that people in this position can evade the consequences of their actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500082#WRZ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenways Provision","counter":1000,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500082#WRZ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1001,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[38393\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500082#WRZ04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the development of the Sligo to Enniskillen greenway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1002,"content":"<p>I launched the Strategy for the Future Development of National and Regional Greenways last July and there is currently an open funding call for Greenways projects which closes on 30th November 2018.

These obligations include: a requirement to keep children safe from harm while they are availing of the service; a requirement to carry out a risk assessment, and, a requirement to prepare a child safeguarding statement which sets out the policies and procedures which are in place to mitigate these risks. <\/p>  <p>  The Act operates side-by-side with the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  The guidance sets out definitions of abuse, and signs for its recognition.  It explains how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla.  It sets out what organisations need to do to keep children safe.  It also describes the obligations under the Children First Act 2015 and who they attach to.  These guidelines have been in place since 1999 and were fully revised and published in October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory obligations in the Children First Act apply to both public and private sector organisations providing relevant services to children operating in this jurisdiction, regardless of where an organisation&rsquo;s governing body is located.  The relevant services to children that attract an obligation to produce a child safeguarding statement are set out in schedule 1 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 12 and 13 of the Act make provision for the Child and Family Agency to establish and maintain a register of non-compliance for providers of relevant services who fail to provide a copy of the Child Safeguarding Statement to Tusla when requested to do so.  A new Child Safeguarding Compliance Unit has recently been established within Tusla.  As this is a new statutory obligation for many organisations, Tusla is focusing on encouraging and supporting providers of relevant services to meet their statutory obligations and it will endeavour only to place relevant service providers on the register where a supportive approach has proved unsuccessful. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, section 27 requires each Government Department to prepare and publish a sectorial implementation plan that outlines the programme of measures to be taken to ensure that the Department, and any body that provides a relevant service and receives funding from that Department, comply with the provisions of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The key principle of Children First is that child protection issues are the responsibility of all and that child safety and welfare concerns must be dealt with as and where they arise.  In this regard the specific issues raised by the Deputy relating to sporting organisations come within the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500083#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500083#WRAA04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[38480\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500083#WRAA04100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the expenditure savings that are earmarked for her Department for 2019 that are not accounted for in the mid-year expenditure report or are not included in the fiscal space calculations for 2019.","asker":"1222","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1044,"content":"<p>The figures set out in the  Mid-Year Expenditure Report in respect\u00a0of my Department do not include expenditure savings targets.

Unfortunately, this has taken longer than expected due to technical issues associated with the approvals and statutory process involved, but I can assure the Deputy that work is continuing to address these matters. My Department has been in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter, and my intention is to include foster carers under the General Indemnity Scheme operated by the State Claims Agency as soon as possible. In this regard, work is ongoing with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to draft the necessary Order for Government. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has written to the Irish Foster Carers Association (IFCA) outlining the position and, through the Association, foster carers have been informed as to the current position.

At this meeting a decision is reached regarding which service would be most suitable for the child. The available options are:1) A Joint Specialist Interview, with Garda&iacute; taking the lead role. 2) A referral to a Specialist Unit such as St Claire&rsquo;s Unit.3) The Social Work Department completing the assessment. When an assessment is completed by a Specialist Unit, Tusla receives a comprehensive report outlining the specific details, including an analysis of the findings. The assessment reports are forwarded to the Principal Social Worker, Team Leader and referring social worker who then review the findings. Tusla generally accept the findings of the specialised unit unless there are specific circumstances raising concern. The outcome of a completed assessment is either &lsquo;Founded&rsquo; or &lsquo;Unfounded.&rsquo;  Tusla relies on this outcome to determine what further intervention is required.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  have statutory responsibilities for the safety and welfare of children and the investigation of criminal complaints. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am not in a position to comment on the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to these matters.

It has been decided to use the terms 'founded' and 'unfounded' to keep in line with international best practice. <\/p><p>In Children First, 2011, Section 5.5,  &lsquo;Unfounded Concerns&rsquo;, provides guidance on actions to be taken where, after an assessment or appeals process, concerns or suspicions of child abuse are considered as &lsquo;unfounded.&rsquo; <\/p><p>A &lsquo;founded&rsquo; assessment is an authentication that a judgement has been made that evidence exists which confirms that child abuse occurred. <\/p><p>An &lsquo;unfounded&rsquo; assessment is one where the evidence does not support a finding of abuse. It does not mean the abuse did not occur, rather that there is a lack of evidence to support a &lsquo;founded&rsquo; outcome. For example, there may be no convincing disclosure, no clear evidence, no witnesses, and\/or no admission on the part of the Person Subject to Allegations of Abuse (PSAA).<\/p><p>The &lsquo;balance of probabilities&rsquo; is interpreted as the degree to which something is more likely to have occurred than not.  <\/p><p>The key principles informing decision-making when an assessment is being made  include the following:<\/p><p>a.  The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration<\/p><p>b.  The requirements of Children First must be met<\/p><p>c.  Tulsa must determine and assess any current or future risk to a child<\/p><p>d.  If a child is deemed to be at immediate serious risk the child's interest  takes priority over  the suspected person&rsquo;s right to be informed of allegations against him\/her. <\/p><p>e.  If Tusla concludes there is an immediate serious risk to a child, this must be communicated to an appropriate relevant third party to enable Tusla to take whatever protective action is necessary<\/p><p>f.  Maintaining children in their own home is in their best interests. If the child is living with an alleged abuser, the safety of the child is paramount<\/p><p>g.  Social work professionals make a determination on a balance of probabilities <\/p><p>h.  Natural justice and fair procedures must be applied in relation to persons suspected of abuse, including their right to be informed about allegations against them and to respond <\/p><p>i.  A Tusla assessment should take representations made by a person suspected of abuse into account<\/p><p>j.  Any action or protection plan should be signed off by all relevant parties, including the person suspected of abuse, where possible.<\/p><p>k.  A person suspected of abuse has a right to have their data protection rights protected, to obtain legal advice, to see all relevant documentation, to submit relevant documentation, to make oral or written submissions and have these considered, to identify any third parties with relevant information for Tusla consideration for interview, and to request an independent review of the assessment undertaken by the social worker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500084#WRBB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":1088,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500085#WRCC00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1087,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500085#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1088,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[38492\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500085#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the expenditure savings that are earmarked for his Department for 2019 that are not accounted for in the mid-year expenditure report or are not included in the fiscal space calculations for 2019.","asker":"1222","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":1089,"content":"<p>The Mid-Year Expenditure Report (MYER) set out the starting baseline in relation to the gross voted expenditure for 2019.

This can be achieved through the implementation of programmes and initiatives that facilitate and encourage economic development through the creation of jobs and the infrastructure required to support those jobs, and to support our communities to become and remain desirable places to live, work and raise families. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development, the Framework Policy for Local and Community Development in Ireland, and Project Ireland 2040 are the key policy initiatives that set out the ways in which Government aims to address disadvantage and how we can support both rural and urban communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the Action Plan for Rural Development, which complements the Regional Action Plans for Jobs and other Government plans and strategies, includes a range of measures which will support enterprise growth and job creation in rural areas. These measures will be delivered across a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other organisations over the period to 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Improving the quality of life of those who live and work in rural communities is another key objective of the Action Plan, which is the most comprehensive Government plan ever produced to support economic and social development in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to employment, Labour market data published by the Central Statistics Office, for Quarter 4 2017, shows that employment increased in almost all regions of the country year-on-year. Two-thirds of the 19,332 new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland companies in 2017 were outside of Dublin, while all regions saw increases in IDA employment in 2017, with over 50% of the 19,851 new jobs created last year located outside of Dublin.  <\/p>  <p>  My own Department also contributes to supporting job creation and the enhancement of the quality of life in local communities through a range of programmes, including: <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;31.6 million has been invested in over 450 projects under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;23 million has been allocated to almost 500 projects under the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure scheme.<\/p>  <p>  - More than 1,200 projects have been approved for total funding of &euro;25 million under the CL&Aacute;R programme.<\/p>  <p>  - 1,100 private roads in rural areas have benefitted from investment of &euro;28.2 million under the Local Improvement Scheme since last September; and<\/p>  <p>  - More than 1,300 projects with a value of over &euro;39 million have now been approved under the current LEADER programme. LEADER is a multi-annual programme which has a budget of &euro;250 million over the period to 2020 and has a job creation target of 3,100 over the lifetime of the programme. <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;190 million will be provided by the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme over the period 2018-2022. SICAP aims to reduce disadvantage and poverty in local communities across the country. <\/p>  <p>  - My Department is also working closely with local authorities to support the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan and rural telecommunications infrastructure. We are assisting local authorities to develop local digital strategies, which will be essential if the full economic and social benefits of high-speed broadband connectivity are to be realised equally across all communities over the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to implement these and other programmes but is also in a position to provide additional investment of &euro;1 billion over the next 10 years through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which is being delivered as part of the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 commitment to strengthen rural economies and communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500085#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":1113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500085#WRCC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1114,"qnumday":456,"qnumall":"[38873\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500085#WRCC02900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which he has received applications in 2018 for assistance from various groups throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1334"},{"type":"question","counter":1115,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[38875\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500085#WRCC03000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to offer grant aid to rural communities involved in various projects to enhance rural life; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":1116,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 456 and 458 together.<\/p><p>My Department funds a range of programmes and schemes that provide financial assistance to eligible groups throughout the country.

It provides small capital grants to community groups across the country. The original allocation announced in May 2018 was &euro;4.5m and last week, I was able to announce a further allocation of &euro;8million to the CEP for 2018. An additional &euro;0.5m was allocated and ring-fenced for Men&rsquo;s Sheds in June of this year. <\/p><p>The programme allows communities across the country to apply for funding to enhance the facilities in their areas.

I am satisfied that the public consultation processes with regards to pensions reform are being conducted with due regard to the guidelines and principles.<\/p>  <p>  My Department fully complied with the consultation principles set out below:<\/p>  <p>  The first of principle is that consultation with the public must be genuine, meaningful, timely, balanced and with the ultimate objective of leading to better outcomes and greater understanding by all involved of the benefits and consequences of proceeding with particular policy or legislation proposals.  Consultation should aim to achieve real engagement and &lsquo;real listening&rsquo; rather than being a pro-forma exercise for bureaucratic purposes.  A genuine consultation process ensures that the real-world impact of policy options is considered. <\/p>  <p>  The second principle is that consultation should be targeted at and easily accessible to those with a clear interest in the policy in question.  There is no &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach to consultation. The size, type and scope of the consultative process depends on the proposed policy, the type and scale of the potential impacts of the proposal or decision being taken, the number of people or groups affected by them, and where relevant particular requirements of the child and young people and those who may be marginalised or vulnerable. <\/p>  <p>  The third principle is that Government departments and agencies should make systematic efforts to ensure that interested and affected parties have the opportunity to take part in open consultations at all stages of the policy process on significant policy, services and legislative matters: development, implementation, evaluation, and review.<\/p>  <p>  For example in relation to the reform of the State Pension (Contributory), the policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from around 2020.  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 confirmed the Government&rsquo;s position that the State pension will be reformed and will remain as the fundamental basis of the pension system in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government intends to introduce the TCA to establishing level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards and I launched the public consultation on this proposal in May. My Department invited sectorial interest groups representing pensioners, workers, employers, young people, the unemployed and more.  Members of the media were also invited and the launch was featured extensively throughout the broadcast and written media in the days that followed.  The consultation was hosted on the Department's website and open to everyone to submit responses and submissions.  The consultation sought input on a range of relevant factors which included the amount of contributions needed for a full rate contributory state pension, the amount of credited contribution a person could avail of, and whether there would be a \"phase-in period\" for the changes.<\/p>  <p>  The online consultation lasted for over 3 months and we received over 270 responses.  The consultation closed on Monday, the 3rd of September.  An analysis of the views submitted is now being undertaken and feedback will be published on the Department's website.  Following this a review of the consultation process will be carried out which will consider whether the objectives of the consultation have been met, including whether the methods used were appropriate to the objectives and the cost-effectiveness of the consultation process.  It will also identify any lessons learned to inform future consultation processes.     <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500088#WRFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1233,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[38705\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500088#WRFF01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will re-run the public consultation process with regard to pension reform in view of the perceived serious inadequacies of the current consultation process.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1234,"qnumday":497,"qnumall":"[38706\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500088#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the online briefing document Total Contributions Approach Consultation 2018 contains significant and serious errors which give a distorted impression of the changes brought about by the TCA 2012 system (details supplied).","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1235,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 496 and 497 together.<\/p>  <p>A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to the State Pension contributory (SPC) calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 confirmed the Government&rsquo;s position to reform the State pension in line with the Total Contributions Approach.  <\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on the introduction of the Total Contributions Approach to be designed for the periods from 2020 was launched on May 28th.  This is distinct from the TCA2012 model announced in January this year which will be available for those affected by the 2012 rate-band changes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department invited interest groups representing pensioners, workers, employers, young people, the unemployed and several other areas to the launch event at which we provided a range of informative presentations and hosted a series of workshops on the various aspects of the proposed reform.  Members of the media were also invited and the launch was featured extensively throughout the broadcast and written media in the days that followed.  The online consultation lasted for over 3 months and we received nearly 300 responses from individuals and organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The consultation questionnaire was accompanied by a document setting out the context of the consultation.  In Appendix 1 of this document  there is a table setting out the illustrative entitlements under different state contributory pension approaches - the yearly average approach, the National Pensions Framework approach and the TCA2012 approach. It did not include a model for TCA2020 as that model has not yet been decided.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in stating that two of the figures given under the TCA2012 approach in the hypothetical cases are incorrect.  I am advised that this inaccuracy was a result of an error in a formula that was used to calculate the outcomes.  I apologise for this.  I understand that this matter came to light very shortly before the public consultation closed, when a member of the public who had spotted it called an official in my Department. <\/p>  <p>  I do not believe that this has resulted in those who answered the consultation being misled about the provision for credits in the TCA2012 model.  In the main body of the document, the chapter &ldquo;Models of TCA&rdquo; highlights the primary policy levers within a TCA framework, and the second one listed said &ldquo;The amount of ordinary credited contributions that could be used (10 years in NPF and TCA2012)\".   People reading the document would therefore be aware that this limit would apply, and how it would impact upon entitlements.  The table in the appendix was added for illustrative purposes only.  It was also made clear that the TCA2012 model was not being proposed for TCA2020, and it warned that amounts in the table may depend upon a number of factors.     I do not propose to delay either the introduction of the TCA2012 model, or the progress towards TCA2020, on the grounds set out by the Deputy.  Both of these reforms will be introduced via legislation, and the policy choices about the balance between paid contributions, credited contributions and periods caring in the home in calculating entitlements will, I believe be broadly debated by members of the Oireachtas.  An amended copy of the table, with outcomes under the final TCA2020 model will be made available in due course, and I can assure the Deputy that there will be no error in that version.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the contributory pension outcomes under TCA2012, it is true that a person who has spent most of their working age life in receipt of Jobseekers payments, and only 15 years paying into the Social Insurance Fund (as in these hypothetical examples cited by the Deputy), would have a significantly lower contributory pension entitlement than someone who had paid into the Social Insurance Fund for 40 or more years.  In most countries, that is how contributory pensions work.  However, in most cases, a person in Ireland who received jobseekers payments for most of their adult lives would be entitled, upon reaching State pension age, to a State pension (non-contributory), at 95% the maximum rate of a contributory pension.  Consequently the amounts cited by the Deputy as being lost by these pensioners would not arise, except in a very small minority of cases, where a person paid very little into the Social Insurance system, was unemployed for most of his\/her life, had no homecaring periods, and yet retired with very significant additional means which made them better off than most pensioners.  I think most people would agree that this is very uncommon, and there is not a strong case for such pensioners to be cross-subsidised by others, most of whom have less means, and who have contributed more into the Social Insurance Fund over the years.<\/p>  <p>  The TCA2020 consultation process is now complete, and officials in my Department are analysing the inputs made by those who participated.  A summary of these will be published on my Department's website in due course when this work is complete.  I am told that a number of submissions stressed the importance of credited contributions, among other matters (notably the total number of contributions required, and the possibility of transitional measures for those who reach pension age soon after 2020), and I will consider the points made in the context of finalising the design for Government's consideration. <\/p>  <p>  Following this, a review of the consultation process itself will be carried out which will consider whether the objectives of the consultation have been met, including whether the methods used were appropriate to the objectives and the cost-effectiveness of the consultation process.  It will also identify any lessons learned to inform future consultation processes.     <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500088#WRFF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1237,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[38707\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500088#WRFF01700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that up to 20 years of homecare credits can be used under the 40 year TCA 2012 while there is a limit of ten years for other credits such as unemployment and illness in contrast to the National Pensions Framework, which envisaged a standard approach applying to the various categories of persons that receive credited contributions; her views on this provision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1238,"content":"<p>The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020. The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person. <\/p>  <p>  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome. In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a full-time caring role. <\/p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory). A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring periods, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme. Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total of such credits and HomeCaring periods not exceeding 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits (before or after 1994), over a 50 year period and qualify for a maximum rate pension, despite additional gaps of up to 10 years.  Those with fewer contributions will have a pro-rata entitlement. For example, someone with 18 years PRSI contributions and 18 years homecaring may qualify for a 90% contributory pension.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy has pointed out, the National Pensions Framework proposals would have treated homemaking credits and ordinary credits with a standard approach.  However, while it is true they would be counted in the same manner, the conditions of their awarding significantly differed.  Under the Framework, homemaking credits would only have had effect from 1994, with both types of credits being limited to 10 years, and outcomes for women under this model would have been significantly worse than those for men.  It was decided, therefore, that there should be a rebalancing of the proposed TCA formula, with up to 20 years homemaking periods being recognised under TCA2012, for periods both before and after 1994.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500088#WRFF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Appeals","counter":1239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500088#WRFF01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1240,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[38708\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500088#WRFF02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if eligibility will be reviewed in the case of a person (details supplied); if the case will be reviewed with a view to issuing a payment in the early future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1241,"content":"<p>The Illness Benefit claim from the person concerned has been processed and the original notification issued to inform the customer that he did not qualify for payment under the scheme.

This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security and independence of future retirees. <\/p>  <p>  Last month, the Government published a &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal for an AE supplementary retirement savings system and commenced a public consultation process on the design and operational structure of the AE system.  The &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal is a high level draft proposal designed to prompt and generate discussion and improve ideas.

Additional social housing supply that becomes available through the activities of the LDA will be subject to the existing social housing allocation systems currently operated by local authorities. <\/p>  <p>It should be noted that Part V is just one of a range of mechanisms through which a significantly increased level of social housing is being delivered.  Overall, over the course of 2016\/17, Rebuilding Ireland has supported the delivery of over 12,700 built, bought or long-term leased social housing homes, in addition to a further 32,000 flexible housing solutions delivered under the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Schemes.  In total, almost 45,000 individuals and families have had their housing needs met over a 2-year period.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of this delivery has been such that housing waiting lists are falling markedly.  Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority are provided in the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), which has been carried out on an annual basis since 2016.  Although the full SSHA 2018 report has not yet been published, the number of qualified households recorded on local authority lists shows a drop from 85,799 in 2017 to 71,858 in 2018, a reduction of over 16% in one year alone.<\/p>  <p>  As regards land acquisition and planning and zoning functions in general, legislation being brought forward later this Autumn for publication in early 2019 will set out the general statutory framework within which the LDA will be expected to operate, including interactions with local authorities and the planning process.  However, I have no plans to require that local authorities that may need to acquire building land for social housing purposes would be obliged to do so solely via the LDA.  Nonetheless, there will clearly be opportunities for both local authorities and the LDA to work together in implementing Government policy in relation to the planning, housing and sustainable urban development policies contained in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework in particular. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the zoning of land for development purposes is a reserved function of the elected members, which is distinct from the general land and property acquisition functions of local authorities and commercial state bodies, including the Land Development Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500089#WRGG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Loans","counter":1285,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500089#WRGG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1286,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[38346\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500089#WRGG02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason the initial practice of enabling members of the public to transfer approval under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme between local authorities was altered to now require applicants to make repeat applications in each local authority area in which they are considering buying a dwelling.","asker":"1242","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1287,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[38347\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500089#WRGG02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to enable persons that have been approved for a Rebuilding Ireland home loan from one local authority to draw it down from another authority (details supplied).","asker":"1242","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1288,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 516 and 517 together.<\/p>  <p>As with the previous local authority home loan offerings, loan applications under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan are made directly to the local authority in whose area the property proposed for purchase is situated.

Rebuilding Ireland is modelled on blended delivery across the main programmes of build, acquisition and leasing.<\/p>  <p>  While it is recognised that the pace of delivery, particularly under build activity, may vary from local authority to local authority, the range of delivery options available, combined with the relevant support structures, provide the necessary resources for local authorities.  All stakeholders are expected to be fully mobilised towards meeting the targets for 2018, and subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's focus, and that of all delivery agents, will remain on implementation and delivery to ensure that the range of objectives and targets set are achieved.  A wide range of delivery mechanisms and a funding commitment of &euro;6 billion over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland have been put in place to support the achievement of these targets.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, the national target is for the delivery of an additional 50,000 social housing units through Build, Acquisition and Leasing Schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The ambition is for 33,500 of these units to be delivered through build programmes including Part V and Voids; for 6,500 to be delivered through Acquisition programmes including the Housing Agency Acquisition Programme; and for the remaining 10,000 units to be delivered under a range of leasing initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  The Voids Programme, introduced in 2014 by my Department, provides additional support to local authorities in preparing vacant units for re-letting.  The maximum funding provided for each unit under this programme is &euro;30,000.  In addition, the Derelicts Programme provides funding to remediate more seriously derelict social houses.  There is also another smaller 2 into 1 programme, which focuses on converting vacant old bedsit type accommodation into one bedroom units.  Together, under these three programmes, exchequer funding is provided to support local authorities in remediating vacant units.  The exchequer funding provided by the Department is additional to the support that local authorities provide themselves towards such work.<\/p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland target for Department funded Voids across the period 2016-2021 is 3,459.  By end 2017 some 4,065 voids had been delivered under the programme, in addition to local authority self funded voids and re-lets, demonstrating significant activity across all local authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  Management of stock at local level, re-letting programmes and timeframes are all operational matters for each local authority to co-ordinate and execute.  In creating more visibility around targets and delivery against targets, it is my expectation that performance in the delivery of social housing homes at local authority level can be tracked and overseen effectively, particularly by the elected members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500089#WRGG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety","counter":1301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500090#WRHH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1302,"qnumday":523,"qnumall":"[38396\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500090#WRHH00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of actions taken further to the publication of a report into fire damage at an estate (details supplied) in County Kildare;

It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.<\/p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf.  There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  Local Authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.<\/p><p>At the end of Q2 2018, 21.3% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility (excluding those households accommodated through the homeless HAP arrangements in Dublin).  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 15.7%<b><\/b>above rent limits provided.  In the Meath County Council area, at the end of Q2 2018, 46.6% of households had benefitted from additional discretion with the average rate being 14.4% above the relevant rent limits.  <\/p><p>The data available to my Department indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  <\/p><p>Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.<\/p><p>My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into consideration other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) rent data published on a quarterly basis.  I am satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.  However, I will continue to keep the matter under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500090#WRHH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Assistance Scheme","counter":1319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500090#WRHH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1320,"qnumday":529,"qnumall":"[38512\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500090#WRHH02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a delay in a housing project (details supplied); if the project will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1321,"qnumday":544,"qnumall":"[38827\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500090#WRHH02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason a project (details supplied) has been delayed in view of the fact that funding has been approved, a design team is in place and the housing association concerned has a track record of delivering in the area concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1322,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos.  529 and 544 together.<\/p>  <p>  While this project is being developed by an approved housing body (AHB), its approval is a matter for Limerick City and County Council, in line with the arrangements under the Capital Assistance Scheme.

Following this consideration, my Department was informed that the Ervia Board had decided in principle not to renew the SLAs with local authorities beyond 2025 when they are due to expire, and that it would work with local authorities and unions to move to the integrated model within the life of the current Business Plan which runs to 2021.

Instead, local authorities harness the capacity of a variety of funding schemes in addition to utilising their own revenue to deliver Part V homes. Where the outcome of the Part V negotiation is for the local authority to purchase on-site or off-site homes from the developer, then one option for them is to recoup the costs through the main Social Housing Capital Investment Programme (SHCIP). Another option is to allocate the homes for delivery by an AHB who may also be working with the developer to deliver additional homes in the same development; in this scenario, the AHB may apply for Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding (where loan funding for up to 30% of the capital cost is provided, with the AHB borrowing the balance) on the overall scheme, with the Part V homes incorporated into overall scheme costs. Finally, where the negotiation between the local authority and the developer results in a long- term lease arrangement, then there is no capital funding requirement and the homes are incorporated into the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) leasing scheme. 305 Part V units delivered in 2017 were delivered by AHBs under either the CALF scheme or SHCEP. <\/p><p>A Payment and Availability Agreement (P&amp;amp;A agreement) is the contract which forms the basis of the lease arrangement between the local authority and the AHB for the purposes of leasing a housing unit, regardless of how the housing unit is sourced. Agreements are generally for between 20 and 30 years. The basic principles behind the operation of the agreement are that the local authority identifies and nominates the tenants to be housed in these properties, and the local authority decides the rent to be paid by the tenant to the AHB in accordance with its Differential Rent Scheme. The local authority makes payments to the AHB on a regular basis which is recouped to the local authority by my Department.

issued under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) on 29 June 2018. The closing date for receipt of submissions was 31 August. &euro;75 million of Exchequer funding is being provided under the SSF to provide enabling infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of affordable homes on local authority and Housing Agency sites, in or near centres where increasing house prices and rents have created a significant affordability gap for first-time buyers and for those wishing to rent.<\/p><p>The call for funding is being targeted initially at eleven local authorities, where it has been identified that there is a more pressing need for affordable housing. The local authorities initially targeted are the four Dublin local authorities; Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Louth, and Galway City; Cork City and County Councils.<\/p><p>Funding will be capped at &euro;30,000 Exchequer contribution per affordable home to be delivered. When combined with the local authority contribution of at least 25% of the cost of the infrastructure bid, this will generally bring the per-unit grant to a &euro;40,000 maximum.  On this basis, there is scope to provide grant funding to at least 2,500 affordable homes facilitated under the &euro;100m Fund.<\/p><p>There is &euro;20m public funding available this year and &euro;26.7m in 2019. Nine local authorities have submitted a total of fifteen proposals, which are currently being assessed in my Department, with the aim of working toward completing the assessments and awarding funding next month. The table below provides outline detail of the submissions received.
