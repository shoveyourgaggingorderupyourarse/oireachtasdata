I welcome Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive of Bank of Ireland.  He is accompanied by Mr. Stephen Mason, director, mortgage arrears resolution strategy and Republic of Ireland collections; Mr. Gerry Prizeman, head of small business and agriculture division; and Mr. Pat Farrell, head of group communications and government relations division.  The format of the meeting will be that Mr. Boucher will make some opening remarks which will be followed by a question and answer session.  <\/p><p>  I remind members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  There was much interference at yesterday's meeting.  I do not know if it was coming from the members' side, the delegates' side or the Visitors Gallery, but it was creating considerable distortion.  If phones are switched on, I will ask either the member or the person in the Visitors Gallery to leave the proceedings because they are interfering with them.<\/p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  The critical part of these meetings with the banks in coming days is drilling down into the 20% figure that was set to be reached by 30 June.  The committee is trying to establish what range of resolution processes is being offered and what sustainable long-term solutions are being put in place.  It is an opportunity for it to ascertain if there is consistency in approaches across the banks or if there are similarities.  It also allows us to understand what difficulties might arise in reaching that figure, particularly as  it grows towards year end when it has to be 50%.  As part of his opening statement, I ask Mr. Boucher to give us strong details in that regard.  While there are other aspects of the banking situation that need to be reviewed in terms of how mortgage lending might be developing and how new finances in the SME sector are structured, the elephant in the room is how the banks are meeting the 20% figure. We want to deal with that issue in detail.  As part of his opening statement, I ask Mr. Boucher to address it specifically and in detail.<\/p><p>  I again welcome Mr. Boucher, Mr. Prizeman, Mr. Mason and Mr. Farrell.  I call on Mr. Boucher to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400003#B00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378285200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

Therefore, at certain stages I will obviously slow down and talk about them in more detail.<\/p><p>  The purpose of our presentation is in compliance with the committee's invitation which from a Bank of Ireland perspective is to highlight the progress the bank has made in the past four years, particularly since the last meeting we had with the committee in November 2012; to highlight the work we are doing to support our Irish and SME customers; to highlight how we are working with existing and new customers in Ireland to grow our business; and to provide an overview of the strong progress the bank is making towards sustainable profitability within a robust balance sheet.  It is also obviously important from our perspective to review the taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland, the cash returns the taxpayer has received from the bank and the fact that the taxpayer is in profit in its investment in the bank.  Bank of Ireland's overall objective is to have a strong sustainable bank supporting its customers, growing its core franchises and contributing to and benefiting from economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378286100,"counter":10,"content":"<p>It has shown reduction in the past three months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mason"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378286100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We are trying to give information which goes beyond the information provided in our accounts at the end of June.  If I could give some further colour, of the 1,487, obviously what is of particular interest to the committee is the arrears customers.  For the month of July, 995 customers had their SFS assessment where these were arrears accounts and 770 of them were offered forbearance.  The total stock of forbearance offers outstanding at the end of June was 963.  What I am trying to demonstrate in what we have tried to assist with here is that we must be careful with one month's figures.  What we have tried to do is to give the July figure and the figure for the year to date.  The pattern is consistent.  When the customer is engaged with us, in over 80% of cases we can offer a restructure arrangement.

That is a legacy issue from yesterday afternoon.  What we are trying to establish with Bank of Ireland is not those not being engaged with by the bank and those not in communication but those who are actually at the point of a resolution where a sustainable solution has now been agreed such that there is a future for them, with some level of hope that if they work through this process, they will be free of a burden of debt.

With the indulgence of the committee, I will refer to slide 10 because part of its questions concerned what we were doing with SME customers.  Defaulted loans at the end of June amounted to &euro;2.9 billion, which is similar to the amount at the end of December in our Republic of Ireland SME lending book.  As customers move in and out of default, I will refer to the December stock of defaulted loans at the end of June, which is a particular focus and for which we have set targets endorsed by the Central Bank.  They are not public targets but ones we set for ourselves.  It is also important to reiterate that we set our own targets for mortgages.  Of the &euro;2.9 billion at the end of June, we had restructured or resolved approximately 50%, while another 20% had offers outstanding.  I expect our target which we have shared with the Central Bank is that of the &euro;2.9 billion stock at the end of December, 90% will have been restructured or resolved or we will have offers with the customers.  Excluding the &euro;2.9 billion figure, in our accounts at the end of June, we provide information on SME corporate, commercial real estate and land and development loans not in default where we have provided for forbearance.  Loans worth &euro;1.3 billion to Irish SME customers at the end of June had been given forbearance without being in default prior to that happening.<\/p><p>  With regard to the bank's business as a whole, slide 17 reiterates the size and scale of our business, including the number of consumer business customers, those in our wealth management business, primarily in New Ireland Assurance, and SME and business customers.  We have 250 branches and our branch footprint will broadly stay the same.  We are investing heavily in our branch footprint.  There is some reconfiguration, particularly in city centre branches and we are opening new branches.  We have opened two new branches in the past six months and anticipate opening further branches as we look at where populations are moving.  We are investing heavily in online banking, e-banking and other solutions for customers.  This is I hope of benefit to the committee in respect of take-up.  I can give an update on the slide's figures which refer to the first quarter.  For the first half, based on Central Bank statistics released in the past week or so, Bank of Ireland accounts for approximately four out of ten new mortgages.  In the life market we wrote about 24% of the new business.  In terms of SME lending, excluding corporate lending and restructuring, Bank of Ireland accounts for over 50% of new SME lending.  When we talk about statistics like this, we exclude restructures.  When we say we have made loan offers to customers for new and increased lending, that excludes restructures.  We have a figure of &euro;1.9 billion in the first half of June.  My colleague, Mr. Gerry Prizeman, is focused on getting to &euro;4 billion.  In terms of money drawn down, we have a figure of over 50% market share based on our own figures against the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The committee's primary focus is on our Irish business, but, given the taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland, it is important that we recognise our other businesses.  We have a substantial business in Great Britain.  We are the sole financial services provider for the British Post Office which has 11,500 branches.  We have access to a bigger branch network than all of the other British banks combined.  We have a significant corporate business in Ireland.  We have 30% of the market and over 50% of the multinational corporations.  We have been working with the Government and have a particular focus on public private partnerships, including the N11 and school bundles.  We have brought our expertise, experience, capital and liquidity to that market.<\/p><p>  In respect of our key objectives, in summary, we are delivering against all of our key strategic objectives as shown on slide 20.  Slide 21 shows our performance in the first half of 2012, the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013.  For all of our key financial metrics, with one or two small exceptions due to specific factors, we are showing strong momentum in our performance against our key objectives.<\/p><p>  Slide 22 shows the taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland, the cash returned to Bank of Ireland, the preference share stock the State holds in Bank of Ireland and the 15% shareholding.  The bank's market capitalisation, as of last night, was at a figure of &euro;6.7 billion.  It has been a significant focus of the bank, in particular in the past four years, that where the taxpayers have supported Bank of Ireland, we will reduce the risk to the taxpayer, reward and repay the taxpayer.  We also provide significant support for the economy, which is in our commercial interest.  We raised capital in the private markets not because we had a problem but because the people who invested in us believed in the future of Ireland and Bank of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400007#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1378287300,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I wish to proceed with members' individual questions.

From our perspective, we have to consider a wide range of options and issues.  We have to bear in mind that any forbearance is a cost to the bank.

The ECB is predicting that official interest rates will remain very flat for a period of time.  We review on an ongoing basis whether each of our restructures is sustainable.

There is quite a big difference between the repayments in each of these situations.

Recently, the Insolvency Service of Ireland contacted Bank of Ireland and the other financial institutions with regard to the consultative process for personal insolvency arrangements, etc.  The issue of a payment break is being considered as part of that process.  The incomes of people in resolution processes are accounted for.  A certain amount is used to service debt and a certain amount is used to pay household bills, etc.  Payment breaks are designed for people who encounter emergencies such as bereavements.  The family car might need to be changed or a child might be making his or her Confirmation.  People might need that money immediately, but they do not have it to hand.  I would like the representatives of Bank of Ireland to explain how they see payment breaks being managed.  I am not sure what is the level of architecture in place.  If a person who pays &euro;1,000 a month to Bank of Ireland as part of the resolution process qualifies for an emergency payment of &euro;3,000, how can he or she receive that &euro;3,000 without defaulting on the resolution programme with Bank of Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400009#H01900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378288500,"counter":102,"content":"<p>We always ask our customers to talk to us if they find themselves in emergencies.

When we put forbearance solutions in place for our customers, we make sure they do not come down to the last euro.  We ensure our customers have the flexibility they need to deal with small emergencies that arise.  If the forbearance arrangements put in place are too minimal in the way they are applied and too tight for customers, it will be very difficult for them to stick to them.

It is something that would be necessary and appropriate for us to re-assess if it became of significant scale.  We are offering it.  As Mr. Mason said, we do not wish to have it too tight.  Obviously, we have to maximise the recovery of our own money.  It is not in our interests for a customer to fall back into an arrears category simply because we failed to take account of a particular emergency.

Yesterday, one of the pillar banks informed the joint committee that issuing 6,000 letters telling its customers to engage or it would go down the road of legal action constitutes a sustainable solution to their mortgage difficulties.  Today, the second pillar bank informs us that it does not consider correspondence containing a legal threat to be a sustainable solution under the definition in the Central Bank's mortgage arrears targets programme.  This highlights the flawed nature of the process from the beginning.<\/p><p>  The vague definition of a sustainable solution in the arrears targets programme published in March last gives the banks the final say in that the definition provides that the bank must be satisfied that the arrangement provides a sustainable solution.  Allied Irish Banks is satisfied that issuing a threatening legal letter is a sustainable solution, whereas Bank of Ireland takes a different view.  The joint committee is trying to make some sense of all this.  I would feel sorry for the Central Bank were it not the culpable party in that it framed the terms of reference in the first instance.  That is essentially the position from my perspective.  It is farcical that the two main banks in the State have been given a definition which they can interpret completely differently, as they have done.  More than 70% of the so-called sustainable offers made by Allied Irish Banks were legal letters which Bank of Ireland states do not constitute a sustainable solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400010#J00900","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378289100,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I am sorry for interrupting.

We do not have a definition of a strategic default and therefore, I cannot provide figures.  We do not do measures on that basis.  What we try to demonstrate is the number of customers.  For example, in the example we gave of our late arrears, we stated that 2,880 of such customers in the owner-occupier sector had not completed an SFS.  Let us be careful to say that this 2,880 might mean that a customer has just moved into the late arrears sector, so it may not be the case that these are strategic defaults.<\/p><p>  To return to our experience, which is all I can speak about, I must point out our arrears are 53% of the owner-occupier sector.  The number of our total default customers, an amount of &euro;3.9 billion, is vastly different from some of our competitors in terms of quantum and proportion.  However, if we go to SFSs we assessed in the month of July, which broadly speaking appear to be consistent with the year to date, we can offer a restructure in 80% of cases.  They may be customers who are not engaging with us for a variety of reasons, but I do not know the reasons.

Our provisions are made on an international financial reporting standards, IFRS, accounting basis.  What gives us comfort and substance to our belief is that we look at the diversification of the Bank of Ireland portfolio, the different geographies in which we operate and the mix of our loan books, all of which I hope are helpfully set out for the committee on the slide we provided.  We look at the different mixes and diversifications.  Then we look at our assumptions - is the number of customers who are defaulting increasing or starting to slow down?  Again, we have tried to demonstrate for the committee that the number of customers who are defaulting is reducing, as is, therefore, the size of the issue.  Then, we consider the collateral.  What are our assumptions behind the collateral?  In the United Kingdom and Ireland, in particular, we see that the collateral values are stabilising.  Our assumption for owner-occupier mortgages has a peak-to-trough difference of 55%, which seems to be a valid assumption.  It is different in different parts of the country.  Ours is a universal bank and we have loans throughout the country.  We probably have a slightly different mix in certain more challenged sectors and areas and that is identified in our owner-occupier and buy-to-let arrears relative to the industry.  For commercial real estate in Ireland, we assume a peak-to-trough fall in our base case of 67%.  That is a heavy assumption.<\/p><p>  How do we, as a board, satisfy ourselves on the issue of capital?  We go through an internal strenuous process which we term an ICAAP process.  It is an internal capital assessment which we share with the Central Bank.  For our base case, we use the consensus economic assumptions regarding unemployment, collateral values, interest rates, etc. and do a five-year model on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1378290300,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Boucher, please, summarise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400012#L00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378290300,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I am sorry if I am taking too much time.  This is an important point because it comes at the heart of the question from taxpayers, that is, whether Bank of Ireland has enough capital.  That is our base case.  An important part of our capital assessment is what we call the stress scenario - if things are a good deal worse than anyone envisages.  We look at the stress scenarios applied by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve.  In particular, we looked at the stress scenarios evident in the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, process for 2011.  We used these for the assessment.  The question is whether, even in a stress scenario, we would have sufficient capital.  One of the things that is important to us in a stress scenario is the contingent capital instrument.  This bails in, that is, converts to equity, at 8.25% if our ratios fall below 8.25%.  In our stress scenario which looks at the quantum of difference between the profit in a stress scenario and a basic scenario used in the PCAR, we do not trigger it.  I cannot ever say that, no matter what, we have enough capital, but based on the base case and our stress scenario we believe we are adequately capitalised.<\/p><p>  The issue of the preference shares was raised and, again, it is important that we note it.  The preference shares have a redemption step-up.  The instrument is a perpetual instrument.  When the preference shares were put in place in 2009, there was an incentive to redeem.  Given that it is a perpetual instrument, it counts as capital on that basis and the coupon rate is 10.25%.  Should the preference shares remain in the State's hands at the end of March, the redemption premium will trigger.  However, at the end of March 2014 there will be no change to our capital and there is no payment due.  The payment is due if and when we redeem.  That is important from a capital assessment point of view.<\/p><p>  We are working with the Government on the options available to us.  I cannot talk about these options because during the past four years when we have come to the market, we have thought through the solution carefully and engaged with all the appropriate people.  It is a capital instrument and, therefore, we need to discuss it with other relevant authorities.  We are hoping we will come to the market as soon as we can but with a solution rather than our thoughts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400012#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1378290300,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Donnell is next in Fine Gael's 15 minute slot.

It was interesting that when Mr. Boucher provided figures in regard to the analysis of July's 1,487 financial statements from customers, he said that 149 of them were deemed to be able to pay.  Of AIB's analysis of the financial statements, 20% were deemed to be able to pay.  For Bank of Ireland, 10% were deemed to be able to pay.  What is the underlying formula Bank of Ireland is using?  What are the living expenditures?

I will focus on three elements, namely, the performing loan book, Priory Hall and Bank of Ireland's branch consolidation or opening of new branches.  In a point I also raised yesterday regarding the performing loan book, I note Bank of Ireland's statement that 89% of loans are performing.  In a way, that tells a lie because many people in that category are struggling each month to pay their mortgage.  As I stated yesterday, they probably are feeding the mortgage before feeding their children.  Do the witnesses have to hand analysis as to how anyone in that performing book may dip into arrears or be part of Bank of Ireland's arrears problem in the coming years?  In particular, I am thinking about variable interest rates and note Bank of Ireland increased its variable interest rate by 0.5% last year.  There is a feeling among mortgage holders that those who are on variable interest rates are being played off against those who are on tracker rates.  What are Bank of Ireland's projections over perhaps five years, as to how it will protect those people or ensure those who are \"performing\" do not dip into arrears?  While the bank may consider them to be performing, many of them are struggling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400016#P00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378292700,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Sorry, that was two questions.

It is impossible for us to forecast in the future.

That is the consensus and then we look at the stress scenarios.  The stress scenarios obviously are significantly worse.  One of the particular stress scenarios at which we look is continued recession in Ireland and euro interest rates increasing.  That obviously is a stress scenario.  What we look at are the customers who are going into default and so, as we mentioned, in the current environment, reflecting work we are doing, a general, gradual and bumpy improvement in the economy and, in particular, the increasing number of people in employment, our early arrears are falling.  Should interest rates spike to whatever level, then the number of customers who will move into arrears inevitably will increase.

I do not believe that offering customers these types of solutions will solve the problem.  I believe that reducing their debt levels relative to their household income will solve the problem.<\/p><p>  I will go through the figures Mr. Boucher presented to the committee.

What I do not get from Bank of Ireland in particular or any of the banks is any sense that it has a responsibility to take a hit for what it did to put those people into a hole.

The bank will chase them for every last cent, even if they are forced to give the house back to it in a so-called voluntary surrender.

An holistic approach is absolutely what we seek.  We cannot restructure in a situation where other creditors are making no gesture towards the customer and everyone.  We are strong advocates of an holistic approach to dealing with debt.  The customers' cashflows are what they are and cannot be adjusted or manoeuvred.  The question is how those cashflows are used towards repayment.<\/p><p>  Even though strictly speaking, under normal credit criteria in a normal situation, unsecured creditors take all the hit, Bank of Ireland has advocated a protocol which ensures as much clarity as possible for customers and debt service agencies, etc. as to what is tolerable.  I cannot say we will restructure a mortgage where there is no gesture on the part of another unsecured creditor, and it would be inappropriate for me to do so.

We are here to talk about the arrears and the targets the Government set when the Minister for Finance announced this strategy on 13 March.  Clearly, the strategy has failed.  It is arguable that Bank of Ireland, in the little it has done, has gone beyond what the Government set out for it.  It is time we, as the Legislature, took control of this and brought in legislation instead of just having the banks in here every so often, asking questions and then away with them, again and again.  Let us not forget the banks that come before us and which are subject to the rules we are discussing today represent only approximately three quarters of the mortgage market.  This is of no relevance to one quarter of the mortgage-holding public.  They might as well switch off the television as the Oireachtas is doing nothing for them.  It is time we took a grip of this situation.<\/p><p>  When it was launched, the Government's scheme was widely welcomed by Government Deputies and criticised by the Opposition.  We received criticism for criticising it but we have been proved right.  The whole thing has been a failure.  I hope this committee does not stop at these interviews as if we have done our job.  We must take control of this, legislate for this situation and force the banks, through legislation, to put solutions in place.

Mr. Boucher was central to the banks conniving with bondholders, developers and right-wing politicians during the property bubble in legal extortion of a generation of young working people in terms of holding them over a barrel for the human right of having a home over their heads.  Following the collapse of the bubble and the crash in the economy, many of them are now on a thread mill of endless suffering and grief.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland now has 12,700 people subject to forbearance and 103,000 fully performing mortgages, with many at the pin of their collar to make repayments.  Included in that 103,000 figure are many people who were forced to borrow exorbitant amounts to purchase a modest home.  I again put it to Mr. Boucher that it is high time that not only Bank of Ireland but also banks in general, the Government, the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank realised that soaking the amount of money they do from hard pressed people is not only causing them huge suffering but is also damaging the economy which Mr. Boucher says he is pledged to assist.  Is it not time that all of those mentioned got together and provided for a blanket write-down according to the current value of people's homes and, thus, a write-down calibrated on the monthly repayments?

There are four people from Bank of Ireland before the committee, with four in the Gallery, and it is not acceptable that we have been asking for three hours for those numbers to be broken down.  It reminds me of a <i>Which?<\/i> survey in the UK that found Bank of Ireland to have one of the lowest levels of customer service.  I would hate to be waiting at a counter for the kind of responses we are seeking.  The numbers should be supplied.<\/p><p>  What does the bank think are correct loan-to-value ratios and loan-to-earnings ratios?  The committee is trying to restore solvency in Irish banking and the prudent ratios were exceeded in the past.  That is why we are here.  In pages 11 and 12 of the documentation provided, there are details of an extra &euro;300 million in defaulted owner-occupancy loans, with the rate of default increasing during this year.  Some &euro;100 million was added in the second half of last year and &euro;200 million was added in the first half of this year.  There is also &euro;300 million defaulted in buy-to-lets.<\/p><p>  Mr. Boucher mentioned that people with multiple buy-to-let properties are his big problem.  That is also true in the Houses, as many Deputies and Senators have found that the receivers of these properties tend to evict tenants.  Yesterday, we asked AIB for an assurance that such practices would not happen.  We will have to get used to much rented accommodation because of a collapse in the mortgage market, and for people, rented properties will be principal private residences.  They may be paying rent to a bankrupt landlord.  Threshold and the likes of Senator Aideen Hayden have drawn attention to that serious problem, so I would like a clear statement from the bank on the policy in that regard.  The Family Home Protection Act should be extended to people who pay rent and live in buy-to-let properties.  The landlord should be pursued but the conduct of the receivers should be considered by banks.  There has been some concern in rural areas that fairly nasty characters have turned up on behalf of banks to engage in repossessions.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, recently told the Seanad that banks had intervened to try to reduce the rate of interest paid by the post office on savings.  Is Bank of Ireland part of that?  It would be regrettable if that happened.  The Minister indicated he opposed the measure at Cabinet but the request came from the banks.  Did this bank play a role?<\/p><p>  With regard to the Mercer report, figures in the presentation indicate that staff costs are down by 9.5%, with other figures indicating that staff numbers went down by 10.6%.

There is a requirement to professionalise the way the matter is dealt with by the rent receiver, which has obligations to abide by contracts.  The tenant would have a lease agreement that I presume would be registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  The receiver would have a commercial interest in seeing that done, as the receiver wants to see income flowing.  We appoint a receiver when we have evidence that income is being diverted.  The apartment or house may be occupied, with the tenant paying rent, but we are not getting it.  The tenant's occupancy would be endangered if that happens.  A rent receiver must respect obligations and ensure, for example, that if management charges are payable, they are paid.

Loan-to-deposit ratios are the centripetal prudential force of a bank's balance sheet and if bank boards waver from that idea, they endanger deposits and lead to a financial collapse.  Yesterday, the chief executive of AIB, Mr. David Duffy, reminded everybody here that a mortgage is a loan secured on an asset.  If the banking sector for six years abandons in a cumulative fashion the prudential principles of keeping loans to deposits at 90% and a fractional reserve of 10%, they create the credit asset bubble.  How dare a banking sector think it is entitled to collect all the loan secured on the asset which it consistently helped to pump up for six years.

A number of them have returned to work but they are not returning to work within an ass's roar of what they were earning when they were last employed.  Their ability to pay their loans, which they had originally taken out on ratios of between eight and 12 times their income, is still unattainable, although I note we are back now to more modest and prudent lending practices.

Is there a difference between a sustainable solution and what might be considered a sustainable mortgage?  As I understand it, the Central Bank has given Ulster Bank targets involving sustainable mortgages whereby they are mortgages that are cleared before someone hits the age of retirement.  Perhaps the Central Bank may need to revisit that and allow payments to continue into the post-retirement period, especially in a situation where the capital is rather small.

I have four quick questions.  <\/p><p>  I welcome Mr. Brown and his colleagues.  I am concerned that the Central Bank's targets will prove counter-productive.  They will have the effect of increasing arrears and forcing the banks to go legal.  Based on what has been said by the Bank of Ireland, AIB and in the presentation of Ulster Bank, the measures taken by the Central Bank to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears will lead to an increase in the level of mortgage arrears and increased foreclosures on home loans by the end of the year.  The increase in the level of arrears seen last month will increase because the Central Bank's targets-based approach is forcing banks to move towards legal solutions or else face major capital sanctions.  Mr. Brown might confirm this.<\/p><p>  Given that regulatory failure has contributed in the first place to our problems, we must be sure a tick-box approach by the Central Bank is not exacerbating the problem and forcing more people out of their homes and into arrears.  Does Mr. Brown agree with this analysis?  Would a less prescriptive approach by the Central Bank that recognises the difference between individual customers lead to better outcomes for them?<\/p><p>  The second question is whether the bank is writing off bank debts, specifically where a property is sold and the proceeds of the sale are inadequate to cover the shortfall on a loan.  Is the bank going after the poor, unfortunate debtor for the balance, given that he or she will have lost his or her home or possibly retirement investment?  Could the bank cut some slack for the genuine debtor?<\/p><p>  The committee is trying to get to grips with the definition of &ldquo;strategic defaulter&rdquo;.

We find there are some customers whose difficulty in making the payment is that they may have young children who are preventing one of the family members from working.  We would be very sensitive to that and we would look to make sure that we did not try to have such a high payment that it effectively compromises the family's ability to live a normal life.  If anybody had loans that relate to tools of the trade, such as a car which they need for work or whatever, we would not seek to put downward pressure on that if it was legitimately related to the means of generating an income to service a loan.<\/p><p>  Where we would have some concerns is where people have multiple cars or they are making expenditure choices that do not seem to be commensurate with the fact that they may be three or more months in arrears with their home loan.  In saying that, I refer to Mr. Brown's earlier point.  With 72% of our mortgage customers on tracker rates of around 1.5% and with the average loan size for Ulster Bank at &euro;173,000, it means that even a full capital and interest repayment is less than &euro;700 a month.  That is not an economic concession; that is a straight interest rate arrangement.  When we look at available housing elsewhere through the private rental sector, one would be very hard-pressed to find some kind of reasonable accommodation for that, so what we try to do is instead of waiting until we have spent all the money and then see what is left to pay for the home, we try to think about what is a reasonable amount to pay towards the home loan and then make sure the rest will not compromise an ability to live a normal life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400031#EE01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1378301100,"counter":693,"content":"<p>My final question, and I have a concern with the phrase \"voluntary sale\", relates to the number of homes whereby the bank has told the home owner that the only solution is to sell their home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400031#EE01100","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378301100,"counter":694,"content":"<p>We would not typically want to do that.

I have been going through the figures.  We have had two sessions with representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I will not rehearse all of that but I ask the witnesses to read the transcripts.  Everything I said to them about providing the information this committee required is applicable to the witnesses also.  It is disrespectful not to give us a submission and disrespectful not to give us the figures we need in written format.  The witnesses know exactly what they are doing.  The banks know exactly what they are doing.  There are about a dozen committee members here.  It is a case of running down the clock while we try to prise the information from the witnesses instead of getting to the depth of the issue.<\/p><p>  I want to move to the detail of what this proposal by Government and the Central Bank was about.  The witnesses know it better than me.  There were 20% targets for quarter two but that was only the first part of it.  There were 30% targets for quarter three and 50% targets for quarter four.  The Central Bank was supposed to come out at the start of the summer and say that those targets were offers, but they were supposed to set targets for acceptance of offers.  The witnesses accept that.  To meet the targets today, the witnesses have relied on 82% of the offers being legal letters.  I am not sure how customers can accept those legal letters, and it is the same with AIB and the Bank of Ireland, but it goes against the spirit of what this measure that was introduced in March was all about.  In my view, this was about forcing the banks finally to step up to their responsibilities and deal with this issue.<\/p><p>  In the last quarter, Mr. Brown's bank had issued 4,124 legal letters.  If people are not engaging, they should be engaging.  If people are not talking to the bank, they should be engaging and the bank has to do what it needs to do, but there are customers of Mr. Brown's bank who have been engaging and who are trying to come up with solutions and he has failed to come up with solutions for them.  The problem here is that AIB and Bank of Ireland have done the same thing.  To reach the targets, they issued a couple of thousand legal letters, but this was about the genuine people who wanted a solution to allow them get on with their lives.  Why did the witnesses not deal with that?  If they take away the legal repossessions, the number of long-term offers made in quarter two was 1,048, which would mean that they missed the target by about 75%.  Bank of Ireland relied 50% on legal letters, AIB relied 70% on legal letters and Ulster Bank are relying 82% on legal letters.  That is my first question.  Why did Ulster Bank not deal with the customers who genuinely are engaging and want a resolution but who have not been offered one so far?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400031#EE01700","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378301100,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the comments.

I have a certain amount of sympathy for him, as I do for all his peers in the other banks, in this regard only, that he is the meat in the sandwich.  Where are the banks' boards of directors?  They direct the banks and the financial sector.  They are the guys who signed off on the behavioural policies and strategies of the banks leading up to 2008.  They are the guys who were the architects of and designed the balance sheets that led to weighted average loans-to-deposit ratios of 170%.  Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, was steady, at a figure between 135% and 140%, for several years.  A credit bubble is what causes an asset price bubble and it is the houses priced in markets that people live in.  The cumulative derogation by the boards of banks during that six year period meant a cumulative turbo-charged rise in asset prices and when they collapsed, 100% of the loans was still in place.  That is what is shocking and unjust.  There is nothing personal in this, but I wish the directors were here.  They are getting big fees and telling these guys what to do.  They are telling Mr. Brown and his colleagues to try to fight with limited ammunition and their hands tied behind their backs because they have not stood up and matched their responsibilities.<\/p><p>  There was a lethal cocktail.  Mr. Brown's bank offered tracker mortgages.  Bank of Ireland has whinged that more than half of its mortgages are tracker mortgages and that they are loss-making.  Whose big idea was it to give them, if they were going to be loss-making?  Was it a way to get market share for three years and then switch everybody to variable rate loans and was it a case that asset prices would remain high?  That could never have happened in the ponzi scheme they had created.  Now citizens are financial galley slaves, including Deputy Spring and his generation.  I am lucky.  My youngest is 22 years old and one of mine is in Australia.  That is why Mr. Brown has an anomaly whereby he is wondering as the arrears are rising at a time when unemployment is falling.  There is emigration.  Those who are stuck here are unemployed and the ones who are getting deeper into debt.  The lethal cocktail of tracker mortgages, loss-making products which all of the banks like lemmings raced over the cliff to provide, is still in place.<\/p><p>  The banks have a problem and it is a capital problem.  This morning Bank of Ireland told me that the provisions of AIB, at 18.5% of its total loan book of &euro;89 billion, were different from those of Bank of Ireland and that Bank of Ireland was not comparable to AIB because it had a different spread of risk and portfolio.  I do not believe that because Bank of Ireland stated, in the original listing in September 2009, in the PwC list of runners and riders for NAMA, that it had gross loans of &euro;16 billion to go into NAMA.  In three months it changed and, suddenly, the bank's portfolio had improved and gross loans of only &euro;12 billion went into NAMA.  My suspicion is that Bank of Ireland wanted to stay out of majority State control.  That is what all of the banks were trying to do at the time because they did not understand the ponzi scheme of credit.  There was this wall of asset prices that was going to collapse and leave the loans with families and businesses to be crushed, distressed and demoralised.  My heart goes out to the individual families affected, to the bread winners and those who are receiving less income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400040#OO02400","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1378306500,"counter":984,"content":"<p>A question, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400040#OO02500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1378306500,"counter":985,"content":"<p>Senator Barrett is correct.

It is difficult to put all of the aforementioned 81% of borrowers in the same boat but a significant number are under enormous pressure to balance electricity bills, gas bills, school expenses and car and health insurance in order to pay their monthly mortgage repayments.  Is the bank stress testing these borrowers in regard to their ongoing capacity to repay their mortgages?

An outreach programme has been put in place as part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears strategy, which we think is a good idea in terms of encouraging banks to engage with people who might get into difficulty and not just those who are already in difficulties.  It remains the case that the average mortgage size with Ulster Bank, limited to the average interest rate prevailing, produces a monthly payment of less than &euro;700 or, with economic concessions, considerably less than that.

Ulster Bank's customers have been very loyal to the bank, despite last year's IT fiasco.  It has 1.3 million customers here and 2 million across the island of Ireland.  It is closing a number of branches - the number is on its website.  It has slipped out that the bank intends to close another 39 branches in the future.  As we discussed the issue of debt write-down, I will not go into it again.  These branches are central features in many towns and villages.  There is no Ulster Bank in my parish, but there were three banks which are now closed.  They are centrepieces of the town, but they will be left idle for a long time because they are not suitable for anything else.  I ask the banks to come together to develop an initiative which could see some of these properties handed over to the local communities on a long-term lease or for a nominal fee if it could be shown it would be for a community benefit.  This would reward the loyalty of its 1.3 million customers in the South and its 700,000 customers in the North.  The bank wants to be profitable and get its assets back, but many of these properties will lie idle for a long time and I am asking whether it would consider such a scheme.  Ulster Bank could take the lead, but I also make the same suggestion to Bank of Ireland.  It would also take the sting out of the fact that the bank was withdrawing from the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090400042#QQ01300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378307700,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>Branches are vitally important to Ulster Bank and play a key role from a community perspective, as Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned, and in terms of interaction with the bank for business, as well as retail customers.  The way customers interact with the bank is changing rapidly.  Last year Ulster Bank processed 200 million transactions for our customers.  Some 22% of these transactions were processed through branches, 45% through new technology such as mobile applications and the Internet, while the rest were processed through ATMs, etc.  The change in the branch network is driven significantly by changes in customer behaviour.  We expect the traditional branch network to reduce over time, but we also expect an increase in other physical points of presence such as kiosks, mini branches or tie-ups with third parties.  There is a change in customer behaviour.  We are making significant investments in serving the customer through the changes they want.  The way people interact through branches is evolving.  We are doing things aside from investing in technology to support this; for example, our call centre has gone 24 hours a day, seven days a week from the beginning of August.  We have not communicated this widely, but a sizable number of customers are ringing through that channel and we are doing other things also.
