I am the director of privacy for Apple in Europe, worldwide director of privacy compliance and the appointed data protection officer in Europe under the GDPR.  I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the opportunity to speak to them today on the important issue of voice assistants and the use of data.<\/p> <p>  Apple has been operating in Cork since 1980 and we are proud of the many contributions we make to the economy and job creation.  We employ 6,000 people in Ireland.  Over the last four years, we have spent more than &euro;1 billion with local companies, and our investment and innovation supports more than 27,000 jobs up and down the country.<\/p> <p>  We believe privacy is a fundamental human right.  Our approach to privacy is different from that of other tech companies.  We design our products from the ground up to minimise the amount of data Apple collects and we work vigilantly to protect our customers' personal data and give them control over their information.<\/p> <p>  Privacy is an issue larger than one company or one country, which is why we strongly support the GDPR and advocate for other countries to adopt similar approaches that deliver a highly effective and necessary framework.  During the committee&rsquo;s session last week, the discussion emphasised Article 25 of the GDPR, concerning privacy by design.  This is a core value and fundamental principle that Apple has embodied from the beginning.  Privacy is at the heart of every product and service we create, and we continually develop innovative technologies and techniques designed to minimise how much customer data we, or anyone else, can access while delivering world-class services to our customers.<\/p> <p>  Privacy by design applies to all Apple&rsquo;s services.  That includes Siri, Apple's intelligent assistant.  Like all our services, our goal with Siri is to create the best user experience while vigilantly protecting user privacy.<\/p> <p>  We introduced Siri in 2011 as an integral part of our products, helping users get things done faster and easier.  This includes tasks like making calls, sending messages, setting alarms, getting directions, finding photos and playing music and television shows, to name a few.  Like other Apple services, we minimise the amount of data Siri collects and use that data only to improve Siri.  We do not use Siri data to build a marketing profile, and we never sell it to anyone.  Our product is the technology we create, not the customer.<\/p> <p>  We have built privacy protections into Siri according to some core principles that demonstrate our comprehensive approach to protecting user data.  First, Siri uses as little data as possible to deliver an accurate result.  When a person asks a question about a football match, for example, Siri uses his or her general location to provide suitable results but if a person asks for the nearest supermarket, more specific location data is used.<\/p> <p>  Second, we design Siri to operate with the most sensitive data on a person's device instead of having to send everything through Apple servers.  For example, if a person asks Siri to read his or her unread messages, the content of the message never leaves his or her device and is not transmitted to Siri's servers because that is not necessary to fulfil his or her request.  This means that messages are not available to Apple or any other third party.<\/p> <p>  Third, requests made to Siri are not linked to a person's Apple ID, phone number or email address.  Instead, they are associated with a random identifier - a long string of letters and numbers associated with a single device to keep track of data while it is being processed.  This is a feature we believe is unique among the digital assistants in use today.<\/p> <p>  As the committee heard last week, to improve voice assistants such as Siri, there is a need for human review of a very small sample of audio interactions.  This helps to ensure that Siri understands users' questions and provides the right answer.  For example, Siri has to recognise my Irish accent and all the members' accents, and members will understand the complexity if that is multiplied across the different languages, dialects, and styles of speech in the countries where we do business.<\/p> <p>  However, I want to be clear that human review of audio samples has always been conducted on a very small subset of audio samples from Siri requests.  The people reviewing the audio samples are not shown an Apple ID, phone number, or email.  As I mentioned earlier, all Siri requests are associated with a random identifier.<\/p><p> This August, customer concerns arose in regard to human review of Siri audio samples.  In response, we immediately suspended human review of Siri audio requests, reviewed our practices and policies, and released the following improvements to Siri&rsquo;s privacy protections.  First, by default, we no longer retain audio recordings of Siri interactions.  Second, users now have the choice to help Siri improve by learning from audio samples of their requests.  For users who choose to share their audio it is still only associated with the random identifier I mentioned earlier.  Third, if customers choose to help improve Siri, only Apple employees - not contractors - will be allowed to listen to audio samples of Siri interactions for the limited review purposes described earlier.  Additionally, our team will work to delete any recording which is determined to be the result of an inadvertent trigger of Siri.  Finally, there is now a \"delete Siri and dictation history\" option in settings that makes it easy for users to delete Siri requests that have been retained for six months or less.  <\/p><p> Our mission is to make products and services that enrich the lives of our customers.  Unlike others, we do not view our customers and their data as the product.  That is why we build privacy protections into everything we do.  It is why we intentionally limit our own access to customer data.  Our products and features include innovative privacy technologies and techniques designed to minimise how much of the customer's data we or anyone else can access.  We believe that users should control their data and they should understand how their data is used, stored, and protected.  That is the approach we bring to Siri and all the services we offer.  We do not sign in with the customer's Apple ID to use Siri and the customer's device processes as much information as possible without sending it to Apple&rsquo;s servers, and powerful security features help prevent anyone, except the customer, from being able to access his or her information.  We are constantly working on new ways to keep the customer's personal information safe.  We look forward to continuing our partnership to build on the GDPR's progress and strive for the highest standard of user privacy protection.<\/p><p> I look forward to answering members' questions.

I work with Google in Ireland as government affairs and public policy manager.  I am joined by my colleague, William Malcolm, who is a director in Google's privacy legal team.  We are very pleased to contribute to the meeting today and share some information on the Google Assistant product.  Launched in 2016, Google Assistant is designed to be a conversational experience across devices that helps users get things done.  Users talk to it to get results.  They can ask for information, schedule events and alarms, make reservations, or issue commands to control a device such as a smart light or music player.  The assistant responds with the most suitable answer or action.  The ability to interact with technology through a simple conversation is helping more users enjoy the benefits of online access.  Users speak in their natural language when talking to the assistant.  By the end of this year, the assistant will be available in 32 languages in 83 countries, including the ability to handle a wide array of accents.<\/p> <p>  Advances in speech recognition are benefiting many users for whom typing is a challenge: users with dexterity issues, including people with physical disabilities and older adults, but also users who struggle with literacy or who speak languages where alphabetisation is an issue.  In this sense, the Google Assistant represents the next stage in realising Google&rsquo;s mission to make the world's information accessible and useful for everyone.  For 20 years, Google has made many products that are advertising-supported and thus free for everyone.  It has done this while setting a high bar for transparency, control, and security.  Ad-supported business models have delivered tremendous benefits for users, including an array of world-class productivity tools, levels of security that were previously only available to large multinational corporations, and vast amounts of free publisher content.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to privacy and data, Google has long been focused on three core goals: transparency, control, and security.  We want people to understand their data, make the choices that are right for them, and be assured their data is safe.  We have introduced a variety of new products and tools to help users understand how their data is used, to be transparent, and to provide users with greater security and control.  This includes Google Account, the central destination to review and control privacy settings, and the privacy and security check-up.<\/p> <p>  Our policies continue to evolve.  Last year, we refreshed our global privacy policy to better describe the information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.  We also explain how users can update their settings and manage their account.  We now includes illustrations and animated videos to make the experience more engaging and understandable.  Over 500 million users visit this site every year.  Privacy is not one-size-fits-all, and we are focused on building tools that enable people to make the privacy choices that are right for them.  Different users want to make different choices about how much information they share and how it is used.  Tools like privacy check-up allow users to understand how their data is being shared, and through Google Account they can change how their data is used at any time.<\/p> <p>  Google Account is used extensively.  In 2018, 2.5 billion unique users visited Google Account.  Nearly 20 million people visit every day, demonstrating not only that users are aware of the tools, but they are using them regularly to make informed choices.<\/p><p>Despite these advances in privacy, our work in this area is never done.  We know the question of human transcription of audio recordings is of interest to this committee, and we want to share how Google approaches it.  As part of our work to develop and improve speech recognition technology for more languages, we use language experts around the world who understand the nuances and accents of a specific language.  The role of these language experts is to review and transcribe a small set of queries to help us better understand those languages to further improve our speech recognition technology.  In recent months, we have heard concerns about our use of language experts in this context.<\/p><p> When we learned about these concerns, we took steps to suspend this process of human transcription globally in order to investigate, and to conduct a full review of our systems and controls.  We have since communicated more information about how audio recordings work and some changes Google is making which include the following.  By default, we do not retain audio recordings.  This is already the case and will remain unchanged.  We do not store users&rsquo; audio data unless they choose to opt in.  Opting in helps the assistant better recognise a user&rsquo;s voice over time, and also helps improve the assistant for everyone by allowing us to use audio to understand more languages and accents.  Users can view their past interactions with the assistant on their Google Account page or My Activity page, and delete any of these interactions at any time.<\/p><p> We are making the involvement of human review more explicit to increase transparency.  We will roll out a change that gives existing assistant users the option to review their Voice and Audio Activity setting and confirm their preference on human language review before any such review of assistant user audio resumes.  We will not include new audio in the human review process unless users have confirmed the new setting, and of course users are free to decline.<\/p><p> We are enhancing privacy protections for our transcription process.  We already take a number of precautions to protect data during human review, for example, audio snippets are not associated with user accounts during the transcription process and language experts only listen to a small set of queries - around 0.2% of all user audio snippets - only from users who opt in.<\/p><p> We are automatically deleting more audio data.  One of the principles we strive toward is minimising the amount of data we store, and we are applying this to the Google Assistant as well.  We are also updating our policy to vastly reduce the amount of audio data we store.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on this important topic.  We believe in putting users in control of their data, and we always work to keep it safe.  We are committed to being transparent about how our settings work so that users can decide what works best for them.  We look forward to discussing our approach and welcome any questions committee members might have today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019120300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

This is helpful.  Our concerns were probably aroused by the information that came about as a result of the situation Mr. Davis talked about at Apple.  It was a surprise to many people that data was captured in this way, that it was stored, that it was later used and that it was reviewed by humans, albeit to enhance the user experience.<\/p> <p>  The biggest difficulty people have raised with me is that they were not aware that data was being captured at times other than when they used a particular word to initiate the capture of data.  In some cases, it was activated by the use of some other word.  We were not made aware that there was something that triggered an immediate closing down of the capture of the data.  Could the witnesses tell us what happens in an interaction where there is an inadvertent capture of data, where the wrong word is used and where it becomes clear, although maybe it does not, that the request is not a valid?  What have the witnesses succeeded in doing there?<\/p> <p>  Maybe I misunderstood him but Mr. Davis talked about data being stored for a considerable period of time.  He said it was possible for people to have it removed within six months.  For how long is this data stored?  After it has been reviewed, is it automatically deleted or destroyed?  We are all familiar with data that gets deleted, but is it ever deleted?  The same questions apply to Mr. Meade.<\/p> <p>  There is almost an overload in terms of users' capacity to opt in and opt out, to the extent that people get absolutely frustrated and in order to proceed, they press \"Yes\", \"I do\", \"I will\" or \"Yes, please\".<\/p><p>From Mr. Davis's perspective, legally, he is covered because everything has been opted into, accepted or whatever.  Does he not accept that with something as critical as the potential for capturing audio information that was not intended to be captured, it is incumbent on him to make the user more fully aware of the potential for that rather than having it as another tick box, another click or whatever?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019120300002#G00300","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I am giving everyone five minutes with three minutes for replies.

Since the very beginning, Siri has been a privacy by design feature.  It has always been the case that when one enables Siri, it is associated only with a random identifier generated by one's device, an identifier that Apple cannot link to one's identity.  The identifier is such that the things one says to Siri are not linked to one's name, Apple ID, telephone number, email address, or anything of that nature.

That is a valid point and is one of the reasons we have put so much investment into developing the Google Account site where people can see in an understandable way what the settings are and adjust them - they can use that to opt out of a whole host of settings, including personalised advertising - and the privacy policy which we refreshed in the last year, again to move away from this idea of a wall of legal text into a more understandable scenario.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's other question was-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019120300002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade"},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>It was on the issue of privacy by design.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019120300002#H01000","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575331200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Malcolm want to address that one?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019120300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575331200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>We fundamentally believe in the principle of privacy by design.

The select committee will consider the Estimates at today's meeting and report back to the D&aacute;il.  The committee is required to report back to the D&aacute;il no later than 12 December 2019.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and Dr. Fergal Lynch, Mr. Dermot Ryan, Ms Michele Clarke, Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher, Mr. Gerard Hughes, Mr. Gordon Gaffney and Ms Sinead McEvoy from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Thank you for your attendance.  The proposed format of the meeting is that we will deal with the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 40 which relates to subhead A.3, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The Minister can give an overview of the programme and the requirement for the Supplementary Estimate and that will be followed by members' questions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

The agency provides both universal and targeted services across a range of areas for children's protection, welfare and educational welfare as well as alternative care arrangements for children who experience domestic, sexual or gender based violence in their settings.<\/p><p>The additional funding in 2019 is due to cost pressures on non-pay elements of Tusla expenditure.  There are spending pressures across a number of areas, including legal costs associated with the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service, but the main cost pressures in 2019 relate to the provision of residential care.  Children's residential services include the provision of special care, respite care services for children in foster care and centres that prepare young people to transition out of care to independent living.  Separated children seeking asylum are also provided for under Tusla's residential children's services.  While the majority of children and young people placed in residential care are there because of family problems, neglect or some other form of abuse, others are placed in residential care because their behaviour is too challenging to be managed in any other care setting.<\/p><p>Children's residential services are provided across 159 centres, of which 64 are either directly provided by Tusla or commissioned under the voluntary and community provision of services.  Where the existing residential care facilities operated by Tusla cannot meet the identified need of a child in care, a private company may be approached to provide an appropriate place.  Currently, there are 95 centres contracted under private arrangements, of which nine care for one child only.  At the end of September 2019 there were a total of 415 children and young people in residential care.  Of these, 245, or 59%, are provided for under private care arrangements.<\/p><p>I will outline the residential cost pressures.  Between 2017 and 2019, residential placements increased by 29% or 92 children and young people.  The average cost of each residential place, whether voluntary, statutory or private, is approximately &euro;6,000 per week or &euro;312,000 per annum.  Meeting more complex needs may incur even higher costs.  The cost of providing private and voluntary residential care has increased.  The private contract rate per placement increased in late 2018, principally arising from the requirement to meet rising insurance costs and staffing costs associated with ensuring staffing rosters comply with the European working time directive.<\/p><p>Staffing requirements are a key factor in the costs of all residential care settings.  Centres must have double cover, night cover at an appropriate staffing level regardless of the number of children in the placement.  Residential placement facilities typically accommodate from two to five young people.<\/p><p> The high cost and low supply of rental-sector housing also affect young people who have turned 18 in the care of Tusla, and this is now resulting in longer stays in alternative care arrangements.  The number of aftercare placements for those over 18 completing secondary education and the IRPP, and other separated children coming to Ireland at a later age, such as 16 or 17, means there is a requirement for integrated supports.  There has been an increase in this regard also.<\/p><p> Children's residential services aim to provide physical, emotional and psychological safe space in which children and young people can heal, develop and move forward in their lives.  This is very expensive but our most vulnerable children must be protected and receive the services they need.<\/p><p> The total cost pressures on residential, legal and other areas of Tusla activity resulted in a figure of &euro;27.6 million in 2019.  In previous years, Tusla managed to contain these pressures by way of time-related savings across other areas of its expenditure.  In 2019, however, this proved more problematic.  Tusla has managed to reduce the overrun to &euro;23.6 million by cost-containing measures, particularly by using &euro;4 million from its 2019 capital allocation.  Capital projects impacted by this will be progressed in 2020 instead.<\/p><p> In addition, savings of &euro;8 million across other areas of my Department's Vote have been found to help meet the Tusla overrun.  As a result, the Supplementary Estimate required for my Department has reduced to &euro;15 million.<\/p><p> In the course of my discussions with Tusla, I have been concerned about the impact of costs being met by Tusla, particularly relating to persons over 18 years old, that might otherwise be met or shared by other State bodies.  Tusla has managed to absorb these costs in previous years but can no longer continue to do so.  I am keen to pursue this with my colleagues at ministerial level and I have already initiated contacts in this regard.  Ultimately, these are costs that have to be borne by the State.  However, if Tusla is increasingly incurring costs that should be borne elsewhere, it will limit its resources to meet the needs.<\/p><p> I recommend the Supplementary Estimate and will be happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019120300002#A00400","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019120300002#B00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

The private providers are obviously offering the service because the State is not in a position to do so.  How much do the private companies have the State over a barrel - I do not mean that in a pejorative way - because of the lack of supply of State-funded facilities for the provision of services to children with complex needs and children who need residential placements?  I do not deny that we need to use private companies where there is a lack of supply in the public sector but I am worried that it is always possible to make a charge that private companies can profiteer in providing such a service.

I also welcome our visitors in the Gallery, some of whom have already made presentations to this committee.  Today is our final session of four on the issue of education.  We have already listened to Ms Catherine Joyce of Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group; Ms Eileen Flynn of the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum; Mr. Patrick Nevin of the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project; Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in, a young Traveller who worked with me for a year in developing a programme on Traveller rights; Mr. Martin Collins of Pavee Point; Ms Shreya Chaturvedi; and Mr. Bernard Joyce of the Irish Traveller Movement's Yellow Flag programme.  We have also heard from Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, a former Minister for Education and Skills and co-chair of the Traveller Oireachtas group; Dr. Teresa O&rsquo; Doherty of Marino Institute of Education; and Mr. Patrick McDonagh, who is a PhD student in medieval history at Trinity College Dublin and a Traveller.<\/p> <p>  A big message we have heard in these sessions is that Travellers are not so much dropping out of education as being pushed out by the actions or inaction of the system.  We learned that the practice of using reduced-hours timetables is all too common for Travellers.  This is a good example of Travellers being pushed out of education, but it is not the only one.  Ms Catherine Joyce of Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group described how her son, a 14 year old boy, adopts the role of teacher to educate the settled pupils and teacher in his class about the Traveller way of life in the absence of any formal inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curriculum.  When there is no positive reflection of Traveller life in our schools, we put enormous pressure on Traveller children and students to take up the role of teacher and representative.  That role should not fall to a schoolchild.  Children should be at school simply to learn and be educated.<\/p><p>We heard from Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in that it is a misconception that Travellers do not value education.  It is a myth that one often hears but it is not true.  It is a falsehood.  Bullying and discrimination are sad realities for many Traveller children, with schools and teachers often reluctant to, or ignorant as to how to, combat them.  Four in ten Traveller children say that they have been bullied at school; that is 40%.  Bright and eager learners are being pushed out of education due to ignorance and discrimination.  I will state the facts about Traveller education again, facts with which we, as a committee, should be very familiar and know by now.<\/p><p> According to the 2016 census conducted by the Central Statistics Office, nearly six in ten male Travellers, 57.2%, were educated to primary level at most.  Among Traveller females, just 13% were educated to upper secondary level or above, compared to almost seven in ten, 70%, of the general population.  That is an enormous gap.  A total of 167 Travellers, 0.5%, have third-level qualifications.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report, A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland, found in 2017 that Travellers are over 50 times more likely to leave school without the leaving certificate in comparison with their counterparts in the non-Traveller population.  There is an enormous gulf and disparity between the outcomes for Traveller children in the education system and the settled population.  Only 8% of working-age Travellers, compared to 73% of non-Travellers, have reached leaving certificate level and fewer than one in ten Travellers aged 25 to 34 have completed second-level education compared with 86% nationally.  These are the facts on which we have to reflect.  We will be hearing about some of the welcome initiatives that are under way but we must put all those initiatives in the context of the huge disparities between the educational outcomes for Travellers and the general population.<\/p><p> Over the course of the sessions, we have heard a number of recommendations aimed at removing barriers to education for Travellers and they will be reflected in our final report.  What was common among the recommendations was the need to provide education support to Travellers throughout their time in education, starting with the early years, continuing right through primary, junior and senior cycles and into third level.  People need support at all stages from preschool to third level.  However, we heard that it is not good enough to only support Travellers, we also need to make our schools the welcoming and warm places they should, and must, be for Travellers because Travellers have the same right to an education as everybody else.<\/p><p> Representatives of the Yellow Flag programme, from whom we heard last week, showed us an example of how to do this.  They were also in the audiovisual room of the Oireachtas to award yellow flags to five primary schools and one secondary school.  Those flags mark a school's inclusivity of all cultures and ethnicity, celebration of diversity and challenge to racism and discrimination.<\/p><p> One young Traveller boy remarked that, before the Yellow Flag programme, he was shy of speaking about his background but, after Traveller pride day in school, he felt proud and confident of his heritage, as he should be.  All children should feel this way.  No child should have to hide parts of themselves and that includes the need for intercultural awareness and anti-discriminatory training for teachers, a recommendation that is echoed in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recent report, Ireland and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which also specifically references the teaching of Traveller culture and history in schools.<\/p><p> We are talking about issues affecting Travellers in Leinster House this morning but they are also under consideration in Geneva where Ireland is reporting to the UN International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  We have much to do to put our house in order.  The ideas and recommendations that will come from this committee will help our State to put its house in order.  That is an important contribution that we, as a committee, will be making in the course of our reporting on this matter.<\/p><p> From the Department of Education and Skills, I welcome the Minister, Deputy McHugh, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, Mr. Enda Hughes, principal officer, and Ms Patricia Sheehan, assistant principal officer.<\/p><p>I also welcome: Ms Tara Farrell, chairperson of Aontas; Ms Cathleen McDonagh Clark from the Education and Training Service; Mr. Neill McDermott from the Higher Education Authority, HEA; Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ryan, head of access policy at the HEA; Ms Inez Bailey, CEO of the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA; and Mr. Brian Melia, principal of Galway community college and Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board.<br\/><br\/>I draw the attention of our guests to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind those present to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the recording systems.  I also advise our guests that any submissions or opening statements they make will be published on the committee website after this meeting.<br\/><br\/>Following the presentations, there will be questions from members.  We must stick to a strict five-minute rule because we have a lot of witnesses to hear from this morning and it is important that we hear all of the voices.  I now call on Mr. Hughes to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#C00200","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575331200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend in order to update it on initiatives to support Traveller participation in education.  My name is Enda Hughes and I am principal officer with responsibility for equity of access in higher education.  Accompanying me is Ms Patricia Sheehan, assistant principal officer in the Department's social inclusion unit.<\/p> <p>  A key objective of Traveller education policy in recent years has been the phasing out of segregated Traveller provision and the inclusion of Traveller children and young people in mainstream education.  Funding for segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into the overall school and other funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools.  The DEIS programme provides for smaller class sizes and other supports, including additional teaching posts, home school community liaison co-ordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curricular supports, priority access to continued professional development and the school excellence fund-DEIS.  The DEIS programme costs &euro;125 million per year.<\/p> <p>  It is acknowledged that not all Travellers attend DEIS schools.  The Department provides significant support across all schools to students with additional needs, including special education teachers, special needs assistants and school transport.  The spend in this area is &euro;1.9 billion per year, which is an increase of 52% since 2011.<\/p> <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, works with schools and is concerned with learning behaviour and social and emotional development.  Since 2011, sanctioned NEPS psychological numbers have increased significantly.  In addition, all children, including Traveller children, can avail of support provided by Tusla education welfare officers regarding attendance in schools.<\/p> <p>  The Department's commitment to improving educational outcomes for Travellers and Roma is reflected in a number of key policies and initiatives, including the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy sub-committee provides an overall focus on improving educational for Travellers and Roma, including the implementation of all education actions in the strategy, of which there are over 30.  A national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy pilot project has been established in four areas in partnership with Tusla education support services and the Departments of Justice and Equality and the Children and Youth Affairs.  This two-year pilot project will target attendance, participation and school completion in specific Traveller and Roma communities regionally in Tuam, Bunclody, Enniscorthy, Finglas, Ballymun, Coolock and Cork.  Each pilot area is being provided with one additional educational welfare officer, supplied by Tusla, one additional home school liaison co-ordinator, supplied by the Department of Education and Skills, and two additional Traveller and Roma education workers, supplied by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The teams will work together with parents, children, young people, schools, Traveller and Roma communities and service providers to remove the barriers impacting on Traveller and Roma children's attendance, participation and retention in education.<\/p><p>Expected outcomes of the pilot include improved attendance, participation and retention of Travellers and Roma in education and improved engagement with Traveller representative groups.  These pilots will inform the development of policy and innovative solutions to issues identified as barriers to participation and engagement.<\/p><p> A number of new initiatives to support increased participation in higher education by target groups, including Irish Travellers, are being rolled out across the higher education sector.  They include the programme for access to higher education.  In the area of higher education, the Department is seeking to ensure the implementation of the action plan to increase Traveller participation in higher education with the implementation partners, and ensure that students from the Traveller community are supported to enter and successfully participate in higher education.<\/p><p> While recognising the supports across the education spectrum that are in place to support Traveller participation, the purpose of the action plan is to bring a focus of attention and afford particular priority to certain actions aimed at increasing Traveller participation in higher education.  While it is evident that progress is being made, we still have work to do to increase educational outcomes overall.<\/p><p> My colleague and I are happy to take questions from the committee on the subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>We will now hear from Ms Farrell and Ms McDonagh Clark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#F00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575331200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I wish the committee \"Good morning,\" and thank members for the invitation to speak.<\/p> <p>  AONTAS is a non-governmental membership organisation established in 1969 with more than 500 members from across the lifelong learning spectrum.  Our mission is to advocate for the right of all adults in Ireland to quality learning throughout their lives, with a particular emphasis on those who did not benefit from education when they were young or who are under-represented in learning.  We know from the various research that low participation rates of the Traveller community in education begin at an early age and continue into adulthood.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of our submission was first to highlight the historic policy context, which is well known by members of the committee, that is, Mr. Brian Harvey's research in 2013 on the impact of spending cuts, and the 2017 ESRI report and the 2019 Joint Committee on Education and Skills report on education inequality and disadvantage and barriers to education.<\/p> <p>  In terms of broader policy context, we welcomed the 2019 EUROSTAT figures, which measure Ireland's adult learning participation rate at 12.5%.  This indication of greater participation is positive but it is important to note it excludes Travellers living in Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The committee will also be aware of the European Commission upskilling pathways initiative which seeks to provide new learning pathways for all citizens but with a focus identified by Government on building pathways to learning for marginalised groups, such as members of the Traveller community.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the role of community education and how it supports the equality of access to education for under-represented groups.  It is a particularly effective way of engaging learners and its supportive environment increases engagement of those who have had previous negative experiences of the formal education system.  Community education acts as a first step back to education where learners receive the wrap-around supports that allow them to participate fully in their learning journey.<\/p> <p>  We know the benefits of community education in terms of overcoming barriers to education and increasing well-being, and we must highlight the disproportionate cuts experienced by the sector over the last decade which curtails providers in responding effectively to the needs of their communities, particularly the Traveller community.  First, we ask the joint committee to support the recommendation in this year's report of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to support community education both through increased funding, and to achieve parity of esteem with other sectors in the formal education system.<\/p> <p>  In the context of today and our submission, we also have a small number of recommendations: to review the impact of cuts to Traveller education; to highlight the positive role models and success stories of Travellers; to address the non-education barriers to engagement, such as housing and childcare; and to support access by Travellers to accredited adult education courses.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over now to my colleague, Ms McDonagh Clark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575331200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the committee.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the committee.  I am here in my role as education and training service manager with Exchange House Ireland: National Traveller Service.  Exchange House is a member organisation of AONTAS and I thank AONTAS for also highlighting the voice of our organisation specifically, and of educators working with the Traveller community more broadly.<\/p> <p>  I am passionate about education.  My image of education is of keys to open doors.  Education should, and must, be about unlocking human potential.  When I say this, I do not mean that we will just unlock the potential of an individual, but that we can, must, and will unlock the potential of Ireland.  It is a win-win situation for everybody.<\/p> <p>  As an educator working with the Traveller community and as a member of the Traveller community, I am speaking both professionally and personally.  The challenges that this committee is exploring have been in existence for decades and yet have not been remedied - not without trying but still there is something missing.  Educational participation rates and engagement in education remain low and this continues into employment, which has other serious consequences for many of our young people.<\/p><p>Together we must work to ensure that the opportunities - which is the key word -  available to the rest of Ireland are available to Travellers.  There are practical solutions available that we all know about in order that we see change. <\/p><p> The first is that funding for education and the wrap-around supports like childcare, transportation, and housing must be increased and spent.  As mentioned by Ms Farrell, the report of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the barriers to education highlights that without the basic needs of a person being met, it is very hard for them to succeed in other areas.  Looking at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, it is very important to be happy.<\/p><p> Second, we must acknowledge and address the history on our island of prejudice toward the Traveller community.  We must work, as Travellers and settled people alike, to understand each other&rsquo;s histories and place on this island.  Without understanding our histories and ongoing discrimination that is too often based in fear or ignorance, we as educators and policymakers will not be able to believe in a different reality happening that allows for positive change.  The only people that can make that reality is us and it is a win-win situation for everybody.<\/p><p> The third is that we must make access to education flexible and ensure that the educational opportunity is accessible and meets the needs of the communities we are serving.  If we continue a system of education like we have, which is built around what makes sense on Marlborough Street and Merrion Street, then we will not succeed.  We must build a system that unlocks doors for people and welcomes them inside and that always recognises the individual and what they can contribute to the community, society and our country. <\/p><p> I will finish now with a story of personal experience.  I am a woman from the Traveller community.  My parents instilled in me a passion for learning.  As I grew up, I engaged with the education system and left school early, but went back to third level and did many different courses, which I will not go into now or we will be here all day.  <\/p><p> Thankfully, my participation was supported financially.  Without financial support from the State, I would not be here today and could not have afforded to have done it without it.  However, the greatest barrier I faced was a system that did not see my potential.  I was asked more than once why I was there.  My greatest support were the people who did see my potential.  <\/p><p> To have positive change in Ireland we need to see the potential in everyone, whether Traveller, settled, migrant, or otherwise.  If we do not see and support that potential, we will do a financial and social disservice to ourselves and the country.  Let this generation make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathleen McDonagh Clark","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh Clark for both her professional perspective and her personal story.<\/p> <p>  I call Ms Ryan to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#G00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575331200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to speak here today on the topic of access to higher education and the Traveller community.<\/p> <p>I am head of access policy at the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and I am joined by my colleague, Neil McDermott, who also works within this policy section of the HEA.  <\/p> <p>  The third national plan for equity of access to higher education for 2015 to 2019 was published in December 2015.  The vision of that plan is to ensure that the student body participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population.  The plan identifies Irish Travellers as one of the target groups that is currently under-represented in higher education.  Improving participation rates in higher education for members of the Traveller community is, therefore, a priority goal for the HEA and the wider higher education sector. <\/p> <p>  In our submission to the committee, we discuss the targets set for Traveller participation in higher education and progress to date.  The progress review of the national access plan published last December showed that there were 41 Traveller students in the 2016-17 academic year.  This is disappointing, given that the baseline at the commencement of the plan was 35.  It is encouraging that there was a significant increase in 2017-18 to 61, but we are still some way off the target in the national access plan of 80 students by 2019.  There are probably more Travellers in higher education than formally recorded but determining the actual numbers is ultimately dependent on self-identification by the students concerned.  <\/p> <p>  Policy interventions and actions have been put in place to support the goals of the national access plan and in order to increase the participation rate of all plan target groups, including Irish Travellers. <\/p> <p>  As part of budgets 2016 and 2017, the Government committed &euro;16.2 million in funding over three years for the programme for access to higher education fund, PATH.  This comprises dedicated funding to support access to higher education and consists of three strands.  This funding covers all target group students, which means members of the Traveller community can benefit from the range and diversity of projects funded.<\/p><p>PATH 1 seeks to increase the number of students from under-represented groups entering initial teacher education.  Our submission to the committee describes some of the projects funded under this strand and the impact they have had in respect of students from the Traveller community.  The committee will be aware of the PATH 1-funded project, Tobar, arising from the meeting with Marino Institute of Education last week.<\/p><p> PATH 2 is the 1916 bursary fund that provides financial support to students identified by clusters of higher education institutions as being most economically disadvantaged from specified target groups.  Funding of &euro;6 million has been provided over a three-year period, commencing in 2017-18.  The fund supports 200 bursaries a year with each bursary in the amount of &euro;5,000 per annum.<\/p><p> As noted in our submission, students from the Traveller community have been successful in applying for bursaries.  In the most recent academic year, 2018-19, 13 students from the Traveller community received bursaries from a total number of 17 who applied.<\/p><p> PATH 3 supports institutional capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies for increasing access to higher education by specified groups.  Funding of &euro;7.5 million will be provided over three years to the clusters of higher education institutions.  Projects with a focus on Travellers include an education programme in the mid-west cluster of institutions and a Traveller-focused work package in the south cluster.  Our written submission also outlines some of the other supports available to Traveller students in higher education such as the student assistance fund.<\/p><p> Through their access and student support services, higher education institutions can provide support and care for all students.  Our institutions are aware of the challenges faced by students from the Traveller community and all are committed not only to increase the number of Traveller students but also to ensure that the institution is a welcoming and supportive environment for them.<\/p><p> In addition to PATH and existing supports, the Department of Education and Skills published an action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education last week.  The action plan will bring coherence to initiatives and will play an important role in bringing the issue of Traveller participation higher on the higher education policy agenda and monitoring progress towards the targets set in the national action plan.<\/p><p> There was significant attendance from Traveller organisations at the third national access forum held in March 2019 and a Traveller student took part in a panel discussion on building partnerships and breaking down barriers.  Similarly, a student success symposium held in October saw a Traveller student take part in a student-led discussion on their college experience.  In 2020, the HEA will also conduct a study on mature student participation that as part of its terms of reference will examine the challenges and barriers faced by mature students who are members of the Traveller community.<\/p><p> The HEA recognises that members of the Traveller community are still subject to many forms of discrimination and that many have felt that higher education has not been a realistic option or pathway for them.  However, the HEA is committed to working with Traveller groups, the Department of Education and Skills and our higher education system to ensure that the goals and targets for Travellers in the national access plan are achieved, and that Travellers are equitably represented in the higher education student population.  The work of this committee also supports these goals and we look forward to hearing the members&rsquo; views on these important matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I congratulate Ms Ryan on the strategy announced last week.

Part of our work is raising awareness of literacy and an example of this is captured in a video, the link to which was provided to members.  It features Margaret Donovan from Ennis who is a member of the Traveller community and talks about her experience of returning to learning.  NALA&rsquo;s goal is to ensure that all Travellers who want to improve their literacy, numeracy and digital skills can do so.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, 520,000 adults, one in six or 18% of the population, find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult.  This means more than 500,000 adults have difficulty reading and understanding a leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions.  Similarly, one in four scored at the lowest level of numeracy.  This equates to more than 750,000 adults not being able to do basic calculations such as dividing up a bill.  For the Traveller community the literacy issue is even starker with an estimated half of Travellers having poor functional literacy.<\/p><p>Unmet adult literacy and numeracy needs have devastating consequences for individuals, communities and the economy.  They are a factor in social exclusion and inequality.  The World Literacy Foundation states that the people who live with literacy needs &quot;are faced with the prospect of poor health outcomes, welfare dependency, a lack of social cohesion, a higher level of crime and lack of self worth.  Poor literacy also limits a person's ability to engage in activities that require either critical thinking or a solid base of literacy and numeracy skills.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Low literacy is costing our society and economy in terms of poorer health, productivity, weak employment and earning potential, welfare dependency, less involvement in society as well as intergenerational disadvantage for children and families.  It is time to invest in people who have not benefited from our education system during the bust or boom.  It is time to prioritise the furthest behind first.<br\/><br\/>UNICEF states that Travellers are still falling between the cracks, with the vast majority of Travellers ceasing education before junior certificate level.  Pavee Point's submission to this committee highlights the grave educational disadvantages experienced by the Traveller community including the following:  Only 13% of Travellers complete secondary education in comparison to 92% of the general population; 28% of Travellers leave school before the age of 13 compared to 1% of general population; the majority of Traveller children live in families where the mother has either no formal education or primary education only; and half of Travellers have poor functional literacy. <br\/><br\/>Since the economic crash in 2008, specific supports for Traveller education have been withdrawn and the focus was to mainstream Travellers into the education system.  In 2016, the European Commission assessment of Ireland stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tA mainstreamed approach is only sufficient when outcomes are identical for all components of the target groups; when evidence shows a clear gap between the situation of Roma and Travellers versus the rest of society policies should be adjusted and specific measures should also be developed. <\/blockquote><p>A 2017 ESRI report entitled, A Social Portrait of Irish Travellers, noted that &quot;the depth of educational disadvantage experienced by Travellers means that specific, targeted additional supports will be required<b><\/b>in order for them to participate in mainstream education on equal terms&quot;.  Last Tuesday, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, who has responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, launched the Action Plan to Promote Traveller Participation in Higher Education.  While welcome, we also need a broader action plan for Traveller education in further education and training.  <br\/><br\/>The adult skills survey is entitled the programme for the international assessment of adult competencies, PIAAC, which provides the most up-to-date statistics on the adult literacy and numeracy skills levels of those of working age since the most recent survey in 1997.  Back then, the poor results for Ireland propelled significant action that saw annual increases in participation and resources for the next decade.  However, since 2009, and despite the very disappointing results of PIAAC in 2013, investment and participation rates have stagnated.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's first national skills strategy set the target to reduce the numbers of adults with less than upper secondary education to 7% by 2020.  While its school and higher education performance targets were reached or surpassed, we failed to reach the low skills target.  The same target was rolled over into the current national skills strategy to be achieved by 2020 along with the same approach.  With 12.4% of persons aged between 15 and 64 in employment having less than upper secondary education, this target will not be reached again.  This fact alone illustrates the inadequacy of the approach and resources to tackle the scale of the adult literacy and numeracy issue in Ireland.  There remains an outdated view that this challenge will fade with time based on school attendance.  In reality, there is a crisis in the learning outcomes for many in society, in particular in the Traveller community.  We acknowledge the contribution of the Department of Education and Skills and the Educational  and Training Boards Ireland that cater for more than 60,000 participants in adult literacy services, costing less than &euro;600 per person but it is clear that we need a better resourced and co-ordinated effort by Government. <br\/><br\/>Currently, NALA is working bilaterally with nine Departments and their agencies on policies aimed at building literacy and numeracy competence across a number of areas, including health and finance.<\/p><p>This experience, along with similar recent developments to address the literacy issue in The Netherlands, Portugal, Finland and Belgium, has guided NALA to call for a whole-of-Government approach<b><\/b>that would bring a co-ordinated national effort to radically reducing the numbers of people with literacy and numeracy needs.  This should include an action plan for Traveller education in further education and training, in partnership with national Traveller organisations.<br\/><br\/>Literacy is a barometer of equality and changes lives.  Ireland can do better to give everyone a fair chance to thrive in their literacy development.  This requires investing in people who have not benefited from our education system to date.  That requires greater prioritisation within the Department of Education and Skills of adult literacy and better alignment of policies and strategies across different Departments.<br\/><br\/>I thank the members for listening.

ETBs manage and operate community national schools, second-level schools, further education colleges, and a range of adult and further education centres in communities throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  ETBs have a long-standing tradition of supporting the educational development of members of the Traveller community.  As State schools, ETB schools are open to all pupils regardless of any aspect of their identity, the culture of which is underpinned by the core values of excellence in education, care, equality, community and multi-denominational.<\/p> <p>  In preparation, and to inform this submission to the committee, ETBI references the views and experiences of directors of schools, directors of further education and the training and ETB school management.<\/p> <p>  Education and training boards provide access to a range of education programmes in both the post-primary and further education and training sectors as part of its broad educational provision and prioritises delivering a responsive educational service to members of the Traveller community as a significant target group, particularly at further education level.  ETBs have a long-standing tradition of supporting the educational development of all members of the community, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.  As State schools, ETB schools are open to all pupils regardless of any aspect of their identity.<\/p> <p>  At post-primary level, research in the education sector has long reflected the importance of family engagement in education as a driver of improved student achievement, reduced absenteeism and raised expectations for parents and guardians.  Positive connections between family, community and school supports provide for greater engagement with formal schooling, leading to a positive impact on access and retention rates.<\/p> <p>  These research findings have been demonstrated in our response from schools with Traveller students, who have highlighted the perceived low status of the benefit of education and the Traveller parents' and guardians' negative experience of schools as key influencers of low participation rates.  Often challenged by the complexities of the formal school system and engaging with school authorities, parents and guardians of Traveller students frequently disengage from an environment that is more often than not perceived to be outside their comfort zone.<\/p> <p>  Separately, it was noted by schools in our sector that the loss of the visiting teacher for Travellers service in recent years has further compounded the communication challenges and opportunities for meaningful connections, which had been embedded and valued.  While we acknowledge the abolition may have been in line with the Department of Education and Skills policy of phasing out segregated Traveller provision, elements of the support provisions - access, participation and outcomes - remain key priority challenges.<\/p> <p>  While many schools, including those in the ETB sector, have access to a range of supports, including those specifically under the general allocation model for special education needs, these supports need to go beyond this model.  Supports and resources, particularly those which align to the principles and practice of inter-cultural education and subsequently extend to initial teacher education and ongoing professional learning and development, are vital.<\/p> <p>  At further education and training, FET, level, the delivery of education and training boards is guided by the Solas FET strategy.  Active inclusion is a key element of the strategy, with the FET sector seeking to increase levels through the provision of high-quality, more accessible and flexible education, training and skill development interventions and supports suited to the individual.<\/p><p>In the upskilling pathways recommendation, members of the Traveller community have been identified as a priority group, benefittng from assistance in helping members to acquire a broader set of skills.  Tuition is offered on a full-time or part-time basis, with flexible options offered in regard to time, duration and location.  At this level, tutors and support personnel involved in the provision of direct tuition and aligned support and guidance can themselves avail of ongoing professional development, including diversity training. <\/p><p> Our written submission refers to current figures relating to Traveller participation in ETB further education and training programmes.  While the data are based on self-disclosure of ethnicity and may not be fully reflective of all Traveller participation, they do give some indication of participation levels to date. The national programme and learner support system, PLSS, records information on learners enrolled in ETB programmes.  The data indicate that Youthreach participation, in particular, presents an attractive option for young adult members of the Traveller community. <\/p><p> Barriers to participation in further education and training are documented in the SOLAS report of 2017.  Some of those noted &ndash; low confidence and low self-esteem, a negative experience of education and a lack of awareness &ndash; are evident in, but not exclusive to, the Traveller community.<\/p><p> ETBI has noted that a revised strategy on Traveller education needs to be cognisant of the cultural, specific and organic nature of school and societal environments relating to Traveller inclusion, and we have made several proposals and recommendations aligned to these priorities in our written submission.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for inviting ETBI to engage with it on these issues and affording us the opportunity to reflect the varying impacts and experiences of the ETB sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Melia","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions, mostly for Ms Ryan, Ms Bailey and either Mr. Hughes or Ms Sheehan.  I will start with Ms Ryan.<\/p> <p>  I remember that there was funding available a few years ago, and colleges were only going to be able to access a particular fund based on how well they were doing in terms of their access rates.  Is there is still a tie between university funding and access?  If so, do we need to dig down further into it and have a specific funding stream for Traveller access?  Some universities get access right and some do not.  People have the idea that access is just about getting a place but that is very much not the case.  Ms McDonagh spoke about having the financial support at third level to be able to complete an education.  How do we measure access in each university?  How do we audit it?  How do we judge whether a university is actually providing access from the point of walking in the door until the point of completing a degree, including a Master&rsquo;s degree, or a PhD, such that the access heading follows the student right through the education system?  It would mean that irrespective of the supports the student needs, be they financial, emotional, familial, social or cultural, the access package should be much wider than one that just implies the granting of a place in university, which is somehow seen as an access route.<\/p> <p>  A few years ago, perhaps when I was on the board of Trinity College, funding was tied to access.  I cannot really remember what the path was.  Could Ms Ryan clarify that?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Hughes or Ms Sheehan.  I remember reading the report of the committee on educational disadvantage that was set up years ago within the Department.  The report was not taken on board at the time.  I believe Ms Ann Louise Gilligan may have been the chairman of the committee, group or task force at the time.  DEIS came into existence as it was being disbanded.<\/p><p>Many will say I am wrong but I believe the evidence will start to come out over the next few years that DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, has failed.  The purpose of DEIS was to narrow the gap between disadvantaged and better-off communities.  Although literacy and numeracy has increased, it has increased at a national rate.  If working class and settled kids are failed by DEIS in terms of third level progression, how can we do a review of the system to ensure it can be enhanced and more robust?  If we are looking at access right from birth, do we need a DEIS system where the supports follow children and are relative to the situation of particular minority groups or families?  Do we need to get down much more to the actual individual supports of DEIS rather than only the school supports?  Sometimes DEIS supports get spread out in a such a way that the kids who most need support do not actually get it.<br\/><br\/>Every year I attend the Education World Forum for education ministers.  Ireland has failed to be represented at it because it does not take up the invite.  I have learned much about access to education from ministers around the world over two days.  One year I sat on a panel with Eric Hanushek who wrote <i>Education Quality and Economic Growth<\/i>.  As Ms Bailey said, it comes back to bad literacy rates being an indicator of inequality levels.  Eric Hanushek presented his research and showed how countries with a higher rate of GDP <i>per capita<\/i>also have higher literacy and numeracy rates.  Instead of looking at smaller plasters to solve problems, is the Department looking at increasing GDP <i>per capita<\/i>if we want to address inequality and educational disadvantage?<br\/><br\/>Ms Bailey gave the figures for literacy as a whole.  Has there ever been a Traveller-specific survey carried out?  Whatever funds are set aside for literacy as a whole, there is no real understanding of how much of that is targeted towards actual communities rather than just individuals struggling with literacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#L00200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575331200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The Higher Education Authority, HEA, pays a core grant to all institutions.  In that core grant, there is an extra weighting for all students who come into the institution from the national access target groups.  That would include Travellers and would be an extra 33% on the standard funding for every student.  That funding follows the student throughout his or her higher education journey, from first year to completion.  That supports the institution in putting in place the pre-entry and, most important, the post-entry supports to help the student through the system.  This ensures whatever supports, be they academic or social, are in place to enable them to complete successfully.  Access is about retention and completion too.<\/p> <p>  Within the national access plan, there is an objective about student success.  The completion rates for students from the target groups are somewhat lower &ndash; but only marginally lower - than completion rates more generally.  We chair a student success working group which comprises representatives and stakeholders throughout the sector.  We work closely with the national forum for teaching and learning to identify what works for student success, particularly for the target groups, identifying good practice and how can it be shared across the system and put in place in other institutions.<\/p> <p>  We had a student success symposium in October at which we brought together students and listened to the student voice as to what works and what initiatives are supporting students to successful completion.

We are conducting a review of path 1.  It is now into its third year of operation and we will submit a report on its initial years to the Department early in the new year.

We acknowledge, however, that in the area of Traveller outcomes and education we need to do an awful lot more.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Hughes, mentioned the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, pilots.  We see huge potential in those in identifying the barriers and coming up with solutions to them.  As Mr. Hughes mentioned, the pilot is in four areas and has been established in three of them.  Within the three areas we cannot say at this stage what the level of participation of Traveller students will be but it has the potential to reach more than 1,000 students.  We have 679 children enrolled in the schools in the three pilot areas established.  The one that is not established yet is Cork.  In Galway, Dublin and Wexford there are 679 students at primary level and 341 pupils at post-primary level, so the reach to those families, to the children and their parents, will be fairly substantial.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the scope of the project, with the teams working together, we have very firmly set guidelines on what should be done.  There is a national pilot oversight group, and in each area there will be a local pilot steering group which will identify its local needs and come up with its local plan.  It is very much a matter of developing relationships with local and Traveller communities; working with schools to address and identify the in-school barriers to attendance and participation; working with parents to support their children's participation in school; encouraging and supporting attendance in early-years services; liaising with statutory, community and voluntary services to enhance attendance, participation and retention; supporting the children in transitions from preschool to primary, post-primary and on to junior cycle and transitions into further and higher education; developing a local action plan, as I mentioned, informed by local data and identified needs; working with partner Departments to share the learning outcomes of the programme; being flexible and creative in developing innovative approaches to supporting Traveller and Roma attendance, participation and retention; and exploring and collaborating with other community and statutory initiatives that can support the programme, such as DEIS initiatives or, for example, the Yellow Flag programme.<\/p> <p>  Within the project, universal interventions will be available to all pupils along with target interventions for specific individual pupils or groups of pupils.  It is envisaged that the majority of Traveller and Roma children enrolled in the schools will interact with the universal interventions.<\/p><p>The pilot project is being evaluated.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has commissioned research.  The first strand of that is to gather baseline information on the position in these areas, very much focusing on qualitative research, interviews with parents, schools and pupils.  Part of that research will involve researchers working with local pilot teams to develop instruments for how they will measure success and monitor the project.  How does one measure engagement or a sense of belonging?  That research will inform, at an early stage, where the Department needs to provide further investment and determine what are the issues  We see it allowing for greater dialogue between schools, students and parents to try to build trust, gain an understanding of what is happening to prevent children progressing and then inform the Department when it takes policy actions to address issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Sheehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am sorry, I have one more point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#O00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We need to hear from other people as well<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#O00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I emphasise that the aim of DEIS was to narrow the gap.

There is a lot of work going into improving educational opportunities across all sectors, including disadvantaged people and the Traveller community.  If one goes back to the facts that the Chair stated at the outset, it is disappointing that we are not achieving the learning outcomes that we would like.  We need to drill down into why that is happening.  I know that some recommendations and points have been raised today about how we should address that.  The main message that I am getting is about opportunity, removal of barriers and supports.  Those are the three aspects that are needed to help the Traveller community, which we are addressing specifically today, to improve its learning outcomes.<\/p> <p>  I have questions for Mr. Hughes from the Department.  I acknowledge the policy of the Department whereby all educational supports have been mainstreamed for those who are disadvantaged.  I welcome the pilots that he mentioned.  Outside of those, has there been a specific evaluation to measure the impact of educational supports for Traveller children since the change was made?<\/p><p>It was a substantial change.  I understand why it was made and I acknowledge the supports that were provided through DEIS schools, some of which are in my own area.  The DEIS school is a kind of catch-all.  Many people benefit from being in such a school who may not need the benefit while many who are not in them fall through the net.  While the intention is good, there is a lot of space for people to fall through the net in the education system.  An evaluation of that is required because the facts and statistics speak for themselves.  People are falling through the net.  I would be interested to hear a response.<\/p><p> I presume the pilot schemes that were mentioned are a hybrid whereby the mainstream supports are maintained but there is a lack of learning outcomes or lack of educational attainment, and I am speaking specifically about Traveller education, and the intention is the pilot schemes would address that through additional resources.  The witnesses might clarify that point.  If it is the case, I am not sure why we need the pilot schemes because we are hearing already what the statistics are and we hearing from those like NALA and AONTAS where the problems and the barriers are.   We should do the pilots and learn from them, but the information is available, with due respect, and if it is, why are we not taking the recommendations?<\/p><p> I commend the Government announcement this week on access to higher education for the Traveller community.  However, there is a significant omission, which is also noted in the contributions today from the ETBs and NALA, that there is no action plan for further education and training.  I would have thought that should come first, before higher education.  With due respect to higher education, I came through the ETB system and think it is a fabulous system in every single community in the country, whereas higher education is a step further away.  Having come through the system, I went on to further education and higher education.  We should start by prioritising need, and further education and training would seem an obvious place to start to assist people in the Traveller community who may need to go on.<\/p><p> We are not all academics and that is a big problem.  We are funnelling all our young people into academia, when there are major opportunities in the vocational system.

For this reason, I cannot understand why we do not have specific targeted resources for ETBs to assist in Traveller education.  Going back to the olden days when we had the group certificate, people who did not want to do the leaving certificate had a step so they could transfer to an apprenticeship or training.  We see the great work being done by the Department on apprenticeships in so many areas.  We do not have just the traditional craft apprenticeships.  The answers are here in front of us.

Many supports are going into schools and it is important that we look to see and be sure about how those supports are being utilised.

To echo the point made by Senator Ruane, there is no homogeneous group of marginalised learners who all have the same access issues.  Regarding community providers, I work in a community education setting where there are a wide range of access issues.  Those can include geography, childcare, finance or a person's previous negative experiences of the formal education system.  This is where community education has a major role to play, because community education providers understand the needs within their communities.  They are, unfortunately, greatly under-resourced.<\/p> <p>  Picking up on the point made by Senator Coffey, let us not reinvent the wheel as many answers exist.  I referred already to the report of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on education inequality.  If some of those measures were implemented, that would address many of these issues.  I say that because community education providers need the resources to be able to support learners.  I will finish with a quick point.  Aontas is celebrating being in existence for 50 years this year.  We had a lifelong learning summit in Croke Park some weeks ago.  One of the key points that came out of one of our discussions was the notion of the hard-to-reach learner.  Many of our learners are telling us that they are not hard to reach, they are just not being listened to.  That is a really important point and that is where initiatives, such as the community education network, are so important to support learners in having their say and strengthening their voices.  The community education providers need to be resourced to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Time is short.

As members can see from the detailed submission provided by the Department, several initiatives are under way to improve educational outcomes for Travellers at all levels.<\/p><p>Part of this process includes identifying and addressing barriers to participation and engagement by Travellers in education.  One of these barriers is the practice of operating reduced timetables.  This issue is also being discussed at the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and I would like to acknowledge that committee's work on the matter.  My Department has been working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla education support service in drawing up guidelines, which will require schools to notify Tusla when a reduced timetable is proposed.  This will help to ensure that reduced timetables will be limited to those circumstances where they are appropriate. <\/p><p> I fully support actions to improve educational outcomes for Travellers, which include ensuring that the school setting is a more welcoming environment.  I agree with the principles underlying the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 proposed by the Chairman to provide for the inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curriculum taught by recognised schools in the State.  Recognising and respecting Traveller culture and history ensures that we can build relationships based on trust, respect and understanding across all cultures. <\/p><p> Officials of my Department participate in the steering group that was established to oversee the development and implementation of the national Traveller and Roma integration strategy, NTRIS, published in 2017.  This strategy provides a framework for interventions across a range of Departments, including education, which is reflected in more than 30 education actions from early years to adult education.  We recognise that Traveller and Roma communities need more focused interventions to drive improvements in educational outcomes.  A pilot project has been established to develop innovative approaches to addressing issues that are impeding educational attainment for this reason.<\/p><p> In the areas of further and higher education, upon which the Minister of State will expand, through the further education strategy and the national plan for equity of access to higher education, we are working to break down the barriers for target groups to enrol in and complete their chosen area of study.  A progress review of the plan led to the recently published Action Plan for Increasing Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021.  As part of the annual further education and training service planning process between SOLAS and the ETBs are now required to consider the needs of a broad range of learners and disadvantaged groups, including Travellers, in their planning and delivery of further education and training.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that educational outcomes for Travellers fall short of what they should be but progress is being made, as evidenced in the roll-out of the NTRIS pilot projects and the progress report on the action plan for equity of access to higher education and we will continue to build upon this.  A lot of work is ongoing in the Department to address the needs of the Traveller community.  To achieve better outcomes for Traveller students, all stakeholders including parents, educators and Traveller representative groups, need to work together to overcome the barriers that limit educational achievement.  I assure the committee that my Department is taking every action necessary to improve educational outcomes for Travellers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#T01600","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that statement and invite the Minister of State to make her opening statement to the committee.

Our third national access plan for equity of access to higher education sets out our current strategy to address under-representation in higher education by groups identified in the plan.  The plan identifies Irish Travellers as one of the target groups that is currently under-represented in higher education.  Members should note that the plan runs from 2015 to 2019.<\/p><p>Following the publication of the current national access plan, NAP, the Department launched PATH.  This funding stream enables innovative approaches to support the delivery of targets in the national access plan.  PATH's main objective is to increase participation in higher education by our national access plan target groups, including the Traveller community.  Each of the three new PATH funding strands is expected to have a positive impact on Traveller numbers in higher education.  The three PATH funding streams will help us to better understand and address the barriers to access to higher education for Travellers.  The feedback from students supported by PATH is positive.<\/p><p> A progress review of the NAP published last year extended the lifetime of the plan to 2021.  This will enable us to gather data under our data plan so that we can make informed decisions regarding the next NAP.  The progress review illustrated that even though there were increases in participation of Travellers in higher education, there remains quite a task ahead to meet the access target, which is a modest target set in the plan.  The baseline of just 35 Traveller students in higher education has increased to 61 in 2017 to 2018.  This is still short of the target of 80, which we will seek to achieve before the end of the current plan in 2021.  Self-identification is the only method by which information on Traveller participation in higher education can be gathered.  In this regard, the progress review highlighted that the number of Traveller students in higher education may be higher than officially recorded, as some Traveller students have chosen not to self-identify.  That in itself shows a fear among some Travellers about declaring their membership of the Traveller community.  This is despite the fact, as I know, that they are very proud to be part of the Traveller tradition.<\/p><p> Arising from the progress review published in 2018, priority actions were published in the action plan for education in 2019 and a commitment was made to the development of an action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education.  Following a consultation process, I launched the action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education last week in Technological University Dublin.  The purpose of the action plan is to bring a particular focus of attention and afford particular priority to certain actions.  Its overall objective is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches on retention and transition of Travellers across the education spectrum.  <\/p><p> Progress has been made on increasing participation in higher education by under-represented target groups.  However, we are placing a particular focus on Traveller participation in higher education to ensure we meet the NAP target for this key under-represented group by 2021.  It is intended that the various initiatives under the strands of the programme for access to higher education are aimed at increasing Traveller participation.  This will assist in the realisation of the target and enhance our understanding of the barriers that exist in respect of Traveller participation in higher education.  <\/p><p> I am grateful to the committee for the opportunity to address it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#U00300","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and acknowledge the active steps she has taken regarding increasing participation by Travellers in higher education.

My questions are aimed at the Minister, Deputy McHugh, in respect of primary and secondary schools.  There was a conversation earlier where I brought up the whole issue of DEIS.  Sometimes we are afraid to talk about DEIS and the work it does, out of fear of insulting schools, principals and teachers.  Sometimes I think we are protecting something at the higher cost of failing a lot of children.  I fully believe the DEIS system is not adequate.  It has not narrowed the gap between groups but has widened it.  It has definitely widened the gap between settled and Traveller students within the school system.  There is research available, which I am happy to send on to the Department.  There was one important recommendation in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the need to set up a cross-departmental task force on education inequality.  That would take in most of the stuff the Traveller organisations have been talking about for weeks, namely, the cross-departmental impact of many different Departments on a Traveller child progressing through the education system from second to third level.  Does the Minister think it is time the Department carried out an independent review of the DEIS system, perhaps as a longitudinal study?  Were he to talk to schools and teachers privately in some of the most deprived communities, they would tell him something very different from what they say when speaking publicly.  In many schools it is becoming like crisis management, not education.  I really think it is time we acknowledge that DEIS is failing and that it is definitely failing Traveller children in terms of progression through the education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#W00100","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>On the question about an independent review of the DEIS system, we are carrying out an analysis at the minute and are looking at the historical background to DEIS.  When DEIS came in, there was a fear around schools being stigmatised but that fear eroded very quickly as schools saw there was going to be extra resources and extra help.  The underlying determination of DEIS status was primarily geographical.  We have looked at this and are continuing to look at the evaluation of DEIS.  In present-day society, it is not fit for purpose.  There are other schools outside the DEIS categorisation that should be in DEIS.  We are doing the background analysis and are looking at a more targeted system.  There may be affluent geographical areas in which there are still challenges.  There could be geographical areas that have DEIS and have really benefited from it and that progression has continued.  My utterances on this, both privately and publicly, are to state that we should hold on to what we have in terms of the ring-fenced funding of &euro;120 million, of which about &euro;80 million comes from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for school meals programmes.  We will hold on to what we have and ultimately we will be looking at political decisions on funding to add to that &euro;120 million.  That is the space I am in politically but it has to be targeted.  Senator Ruane was talking about inclusion and bridging the gap between members of the Traveller community and mainstreaming in the classroom.  We want to get to a place where we have meaningful inclusion.  We have gone from segregation and exclusion.  We are in that space of inclusion but we have to get meaningful inclusion, which means participation.<\/p><p>We have weaknesses in achieving that inclusion for Travellers in the school system, as in society in general.

Our committee is looking at Travellers who are within that group.<\/p> <p>  We have had four weeks of hearings on education and we have heard some distressing and disturbing testimonies from people who have shared their experiences of the educational system, but also in regard to mental health and health issues as well.  Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in said that a misconception and a myth that is often repeated is that Travellers do not value education.  It is very clear that Travellers do.  Representatives of Pavee Point said that Travellers do not so much as drop out, but are pushed out.  That was a very clear statement on their part.<\/p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Education and Skills has done sterling work on researching the reduced timetables, a practice that was hidden in plain sight.<\/p> <p>  Only 80% of Traveller children transfer from primary school to secondary school.  That is an estimate; we do not have firm figures.  One in four leaves before the age of 13.  Travellers are 50 times more likely to leave school without a leaving certificate than the general population.  Only 167 Travellers have accessed third level education and wheels are now turning in respect of that.  NALA produced a new statistic today that half of Travellers have poor functional literacy, putting them at grave educational disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  All of the steps, including the pilots and the NITRIS, indicate that something is happening.  If it was twice as likely for a Traveller to leave school without a leaving certificate than a settled person, it would be an issue, but it is 50 times.  I asked this question of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Daly.  Does the Minister accept there is a crisis in education affecting Travellers and that the actions need to be viewed in that light?<\/p> <p>  I believe the Minister promised in the Seanad that he would take forward the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill.  When will that be brought before the D&aacute;il?  All the NGOs have called for a national education strategy.  We have an element of it with the higher education strategy.   Senator Coffey identified gaps in further education and we heard about gaps in community education.  We hear of great initiatives such as Tobar in Marino.  It needs to be put on a firm financial footing so that it can do its important work in encouraging teachers from the Traveller community to be nurtured and brought forward.  I understand the Yellow Flag programme is not funded by the Department of Education and Skills but by the Department of Justice and Equality, which I do not understand.  That also needs to be put on a firm financial footing.<\/p><p>It is about the scale of the job that needs to be done.

That challenge was taken on with DEIS, which tries to use a more inclusive model leading to greater progression.  One of the outstanding features of this morning's Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, results was the focus on a more equitable education system.

God knows what might happen tonight.<\/p> <p>  I was present in the Seanad and participated in the debate on that legislation.  I was also part of the decision on the place of history in our junior cycle curriculum.  Part of the positive feedback I have received from history teachers relates to local history now that junior cycle has that flexibility.  There is an abundance of local history and a wealth of information on Traveller culture.  We have a great opportunity and I would like progress in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Functional literacy requires considerable work.  I worked on a youth project a long time ago.  One of the actions we strongly supported was providing homework clubs for young people in disadvantaged areas.  A number of young Travellers participated in a homework club.  At the time it was primarily Traveller girls and we had that difficulty of getting Traveller boys into that club.  We found other ways for them to participate in formal education, one of which was not as a segregated group but with other young lads from the estate.<\/p> <p>  It goes back to the Chairman's question on how to have meaningful inclusion and the capacity.  We need to upskill and train teachers to ensure that they have the capacity to deal with the literacy and numeracy challenges for all groups and not just Travellers.  That is at the heart of our system.<\/p><p>At the heart of my education plan when I came into this Department was the word \"cumas&uacute;\", meaning empowerment.  My plan aims to empower each individual.

The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, accepted that there is a crisis.  The Minister said there is an enormous challenge in education.  That is the point I wish to make.

It is acknowledged throughout the Traveller community.  Last week, I launched the action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education.  I mentioned figures earlier but the Chair is right that there is not meaningful inclusion and in asking whether Travellers drop out or get pushed out.  It was very interesting that there were six students at the launch who were in higher education.  I launched the action plan at that event and I realised that it connected with what these young students were saying.  To give the committee an idea of that, the students said they did not even have the confidence to enter third level.  They felt excluded and that they were not welcome.  They were uncomfortable.  They were bullied and experienced the hate speech which the Chair has talked about so much.<\/p> <p>  They also talked about what could help them.  Three or four distinct pieces of information came through.  These are included in the action plan.  One relates to the transition from secondary school to third level.  Some do not come through secondary school but via another path.  They talked about the great importance of the access officer in the higher education institutions.  They talked about one good adult helping them to get that confidence.  That came up on numerous occasions.  They talked about having teachers from the Traveller community in the system.  This comes under our path 1 funding, which totals &euro;2.7 million over three years.  I believe the Chair was talking about the Tobar project earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019120300002#Z00800","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1575331200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Is it on a firm footing?

I have visited schools of sanctuary in Galway.  There are six institutions in the higher education universities and institutes of sanctuary.  Again, it is to give students confidence and to welcome them.  It is not just academia.  There is more to education and more going on.

We will tell how it is but we will make very direct recommendations while acknowledging that some positive things are happening.  It is the scale of the challenge and of all of those areas that is arresting.  All of us, as committee members, have been shocked anew by the level of disparity between the settled community and Travellers access to education and health, the impact of mental ill health, and employment.  It is shocking that there is an 80% unemployment rate among Travellers at a time we, as an economy, enjoy full employment.
