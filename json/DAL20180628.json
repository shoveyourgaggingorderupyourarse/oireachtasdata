He is correct to highlight the fact that there are number of challenges facing general practice we need to work on, including the resourcing and, most importantly, ensuring it is well positioned to serve the community now and into the future in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It is important to acknowledge the factual situation.  The number of GPs on the specialist register continues to increase.  There were 2,270 GPs on the specialist register in 2010 compared with 3,668 GPs as of 18 May 2018.  The number of GPs contracted by the HSE under the general medical services, GMS, scheme has increased from 2,098 in 2008 to 2,497 as of 1 June 2018.  The number of GPs providing services under the GMS contract has increased, therefore, along with the number of GPs registered on the specialist register.  There are challenges, as we have an ageing and growing population and more chronic diseases that need to be managed in our community.  I do not dispute that in any manner.<\/p>  <p>  General practice is one of the cornerstones of the health service.  The Government is committed to engaging with the representatives of GPs on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the 1989 GMS contract.  Our goal is to develop a contractual framework that has a population health focus providing, in particular, for chronic disease, structured care for chronic disease in the community and up-to-date provisions on service quality and standards, performance and accountability.  Officials from my Department and the HSE met the IMO at the beginning of May to set out the State's position.  The Department subsequently wrote to the IMO setting out these proposals formally.  In line with the long established industrial relations approach to such processes, and with the agreement of the parties concerned, I am not in a position to give further details while this engagement is under way.  That is normal during negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the NAGP is also anxious to be involved in discussions about reform of the GMS contract.  I have indicated my willingness to consult the association formally on the many issues facing general practice and I anticipate that arrangements in this regard will be made in the coming weeks.  My Department has written to the NAGP in this regard pointing out that we would commence discussions and negotiations with the IMO, which is a member of ICTU.  That is how the State does its business on many contractual issues.  However, the Department also stated that we would also provide the NAGP with an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to that.  That will happen in the coming weeks and I have put that in writing to the NAGP.  I look forward to positive and productive engagement with all parties concerned.

It is the position of the Deputy's party and of all parties in the House that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has a crucial role in how we do our business in respect of industrial relations.  The Irish Medical Organisation is a member of ICTU and it is the body with which successive Governments, including those led by the Deputy's party, have engaged on delivering issues for general practice and for the health service generally.  The NAGP has a constructive role to play and it has some good ideas for how to reform and improve our health service.  I want to engage with it in that regard.  In doing so, I will be the first Minister for Health to engage with the association and bring it into a process.  However, I must respect the structures in which we operate and the agreements we have for how these processes are carried out with the Irish Medical Organisation.  As the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, and these issues were negotiated when both the Deputy's party and my party were in government through the ICTU structures and engagement with ICTU, it is appropriate that I begin the conversation with the IMO.  The NAGP will have a role to play.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the eighth amendment, I fundamentally disagree with the approach being adopted by members of the NAGP in this regard in terms of the sequence.  We will agree the clinical guidelines first with the medical colleges, which includes the Irish College of General Practitioners, and then we will engage on how we will resource it.  We will get the clinical guidelines right.  I do not wish to see the issues around implementing the mandate of the Irish people in the referendum being conflated, and the Deputy is not doing this, with issues regarding FEMPI and the future of general practice.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the NAGP for the constructive role it played with regard to CervicalCheck.

When it cannot get responses from the Government to those letters, one must be worried.<\/p>  <p>  However, this question is about the negotiation on the GP contract.  In August 2016 the Minister said the following: \"I think it is absolutely essential that we have the new contract negotiated and I want to see the NAGP as part of that ... what I am doing is saying very clearly that when we get down to negotiating the GP contact, which I expect to happen by the end of the year [which was by the end of 2016], that the NAGP need to be in the room\".  It is now two years later and the negotiations on the GP contract started months ago.  The NAGP, on foot of this promise, has written to the Minister repeatedly but it cannot even get a letter in response to say when he expects its representatives to be in the room.

If a different sequence were put in place it would be a significant cause of concern for organisations such as the Irish Medical Organisation and possibly, by extension, the broader industrial relations mechanism in this country.  We negotiate with the Irish Medical Organisation but I did say, and I stand by what I said, that we must have an inclusive process that enables other organisations to put forward their ideas.

The long-term strategy to develop sustainable scoliosis services has been prioritised by my Department and the HSE in the 2018 HSE national service plan.  The Deputy is correct that the country was appalled by what it saw on RT&Eacute;, and it should not have been necessary to see it on RT&Eacute; to respond to it.  It is clearly an issue that had been ongoing for many years.  The country made progress on it from time to time but never fully got on top of it.  That is why we have taken it very seriously.  An additional &euro;9 million has been provided to the HSE this year specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including further increasing access to scoliosis services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Children's hospital group committed to a two-year service development plan to implement an orthopaedic service that provides timely access for outpatient and inpatient services.  The HSE has confirmed that as part of this plan, the four-month target for all patients who are clinically deemed - the phrase \"clinically deemed\" is important - to require surgery will be maintained.<\/p>  <p>  The Children's hospital group has advised that at the end of May,\u00a0there were 166\u00a0active patients on the group's spinal waiting list, of whom 88 were waiting in excess of four months.\u00a0 However, the hospital group advises that it is confident the four-month target will be met as activity levels are\u00a0predicted to increase\u00a0with the expected appointment this year of\u00a0two new paediatric orthopaedic consultants.  While it is not good that anybody is waiting a long time there are 88 now and there were 182 last September.  We have made significant progress in reducing the number of people waiting and the length of time they are waiting. <\/p>  <p>  The increased investment in the service in 2018 will stabilise and expand the current capacity.  Consultants in the group clinically prioritise patients for surgery.  Up to the end of May, 177 surgeries have taken place across the Children's hospital group.\u00a0 The scheduling of spinal surgery for patients in this age group is frequently dependent on the timetabling of examinations and other school commitments, which is logical.  As a result, activity is set to increase significantly during the summer months and I met the CEO of the Children's hospital group about this last week.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, from April this year, additional theatre capacity for Temple Street Hospital\u00a0is being facilitated in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital.  I received correspondence from the Scoliosis Awareness and Support Ireland advocacy group.  It is holding an event at the hospital on Saturday to highlight the fact that Cappagh is open for business and that there is capacity to do more there.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for two additional consultant posts for paediatric orthopaedics has been provided and it is expected the consultants will be appointed in the fourth quarter of this year.  As an interim step, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin commenced an outpatient department spinal review clinic in May.  The aim of this clinic is to reduce the wait for the first outpatient appointment to six months by September.  Importantly, we will be launching the scoliosis co-design plan in July.  This plan is not written by me but by the clinicians, the hospital group and, crucially, the advocacy groups.  All three advocacy groups have been part of that.

The programme aims to achieve a nationally equitable approach to service provision for all children based on their individual need and regardless of where they live or where they go to school.  That is an important part of the plan.  Some HSE areas have already reconfigured into interdisciplinary children&rsquo;s disability network teams.  Thus far, a total of 56 networks are in place.  The remaining 82 teams are developing their reconfiguration and implementation plan and will be reconfigured in 2018.  HSE areas currently planning reconfiguration continue to have significant early intervention and school age services in place, provided either directly by the HSE or by the voluntary service providers funded by the HSE.  A key enabler to the establishment of the remaining children&rsquo;s disability network teams is the recruitment of children&rsquo;s disability network managers.  The grade and role for this post has been agreed.  However, following the outcome of a protracted industrial relations process with F&oacute;rsa, a process of mediation is currently ongoing with the relevant lead agencies, including key voluntary providers, to agree a path forward for recruitment for these posts.

I want to acknowledge that those reductions have been painful and extremely difficult.

There has been a 38% reduction in the gross income of practices as a result of FEMPI.  That is because the latter was applied to gross fees, not to the incomes of GPs.  It is the gross fee which goes to support the structure of a general practice and not just the income of the GP.  It has eroded the business model that has been sustained since the previous contract was agreed in 1972, some 46 years ago.<\/p>  <p>  FEMPI has been unwound for all other public servants.

As the Deputy is aware, we increased the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, budget to &euro;50 million this year.  By any objective analysis, that has seen progress in the time it takes to get a hospital operation or procedure.  We now need to do the same for outpatients because the outpatient waiting list is still a significant cause of concern.  As a result, I recently allocated &euro;3 million from the NTPF to fund outpatient initiatives and my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are in the process of finalising those actions.  All hospital groups have been invited by the HSE and the NTPF to bring forward proposals for specific outpatient initiatives for inclusion in this action plan.  This plan will support the HSE's compliance with its national service plan targets and will aim to reduce the growth in the size of outpatient lists and, similarly to what we did with inpatients last year, seek to reduce the number over a period.<\/p>  <p>  Tallaght University Hospital advises me that from January to May 2018, there have been a total of 3,925 neurology outpatient attendances, an increase of 18% on the same period in 2017.

The good news is that it will take actions to reduce the outpatient waiting times.  It recently held a number of improvement workshops to agree these actions and what it will do to implement them to reverse the trends in neurology.  I am pleased to say that a new, on-site, general practitioner, GP, led headache clinic is due to be established in the next few weeks at Tallaght Hospital.  Registrar and advanced nurse practitioner clinics in neurology will begin in the last quarter of this year.  This will enable consultants to increase the numbers of new patients seen at clinics as a number of repeat appointments can be seen by advanced nurse practitioners and registrars.  The hospital is also investigating the possibility of launching consultant-led clinics in Naas Hospital and transferring appropriate appointments to that service.  There are three practical actions that the hospital is due to commence.  The on-site GP-led headache clinic, which will commence in the next few weeks at the hospital, will be welcome to many with regard to trying to triage and reduce the number of outpatients, while one can target those awaiting a consultant appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800008#F00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1530181200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I take it on board and we recently debated it in the D&aacute;il ourselves.  This Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.  As part of its ongoing service provision, this year the HSE will provide over 8,300 residential places to families in need across the country.  Residential places make up over two thirds of the disability budget.  That is a figure that people often do not know.  Our policy is for people with disabilities to be supported to achieve their full potential so that, where possible, they can live on an everyday basis among family and friends in the community.  All residential placements for adults with disabilities are considered following detailed clinical assessments by HSE services.  Access to places for those with the most complex needs are allocated on a priority basis and the availability of appropriate services.<\/p><p>A significant underlying challenge relates to the unmet need for residential and respite care that arises from the absence of investment during the economic downturn.  The HSE national database figures indicate an annual requirement of over 400 residential places per year.  As a result, the service is experiencing a high annual demand for emergency residential places to respond to the most urgent cases.  In 2018, the HSE national service plan provides for support for 385 persons through 130 emergency places, 135 in-home supports and 120 in-home respite supports.  I am informed by the HSE that there are currently 1,093 placements being provided in the Cork-Kerry community healthcare area.  The demand for residential places is in excess of places available.  I accept questions and will respond accordingly.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>A residential placement committee made up of all service providers has been established who work collaboratively, and in partnership, to respond to the growing need of service users and their families.  This committee is planning for the future, while also reviewing existing services and the varying level of need.  Families need support to care for their loved ones at home and the Government is committed to providing a range of accessible respite care supports for people with a disability and their families.  There is an absolute need for increased respite care and in 2018 an additional &euro;10 million specifically to enhance respite care was provided.  In April of this year, this extra funding enabled the opening of an additional service in Listowel, County Kerry.  Up to the end of last month, an additional 108 respite nights were provided to 15 persons.  Additional respite is planned towards the end of the year in west Cork, which will facilitate referrals from across County Cork.  In the meantime, a range of alternative respite options will begin in the coming weeks across County Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800008#F00900","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1530181200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>There is a serious issue with respite provision but this question focuses on residential placements.

The Cope Foundation has 175 of those and 27 of them are deemed to be priority 1.

The Deputy mentioned the Brothers of Charity, who are providing 184 residential places, Cope Foundation is providing 437 residential places and the Cork Association for Autism is providing 16 places.  There is work going on, although I accept we have a hell of a lot more to do.

The bottom line - and the figure for which I am pitching - is that we would ensure 400 residential emergency places are available every year to ensure we deal with these priority cases.  There are a lot of families doing fantastic work but, as they get older and sometimes themselves have disabilities, they need support.

This year, the HSE consolidated the funding for home help and standard home care packages, which now operate as a single home support service.  This new approach will provide significant benefits: the services will be easier to understand; the application and decision-making processes will be streamlined; and it will be easier for people availing of home support to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change without the need for an additional application process.<\/p>  <p>  Home support services were a particular area of focus in budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25 million allocated.  This brought the total funding for home support services to &euro;408 million.  As a result, the HSE has been able to increase the provision of home support services.  Its national service plan provides for a target of just over 17 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.  This represents an increase of 754,000 hours and home support for 500 more people compared to last year.  In addition, 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  Earlier this year, a further initiative saw 324 people being provided with home support services in the context of the recent adverse weather events.<\/p>  <p>  The overall budget for home support services for people living in the CHO 2 catchment area increased in 2017 and 2018 and is now just over &euro;43 million.

The cost for agency consultants specifically comes to more than &euro;100 million a year.

We are all well aware that has not happened as a consequence of the prevarication of the British Government.  There is, quite rightly, huge concern among people and businesses about this matter.  There is massive worry right across Ireland, North and South, about the consequences of Brexit and the negative impact it will have on key sectors in the economy.  The T&aacute;naiste is well aware of those concerns.<\/p> <p> As matters stand, the British position would impose a hard border on our island and would lead to the imposition of barriers in the context of east-west trade.  It would also undermine and damage the Good Friday Agreement.  Britain's negotiating position is to run down the clock, delay and delay again.  Allowing some time for Theresa May to get her house in order might have been sensible for some time but now we are playing right into the hands of the British Government.  We are told tomorrow's European Council statement will express concern that no substantial progress has been made on the backstop solution.  Such a statement is meaningless if we are to turn a blind eye to the British negotiating side in these talks.  Last December, we were informed by Government, with all the attendant fanfare, that we had a cast-iron guarantee.  We were told that in the event of a no-deal scenario, there would be no border on the island of Ireland.  We were told the backstop arrangement was our insurance policy and that it would come into play in the event of a hard Brexit.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in supported the Government at the time despite the limitations of what was on offer in December last year.  We did so because we want what is best for Ireland's interests.  That means there is an onus on the Government to step up to the mark and not allow us to move into October without a resolution to the Irish issues.  That means the EU negotiating strategy must be informed by Irish thinking.  The Irish perspective needs to be at the centre of the table and needs to move things forward.  If that requires a special European Council summit in September to deal with the issues relating to the Irish question, then so be it.  We should be making that call because we need to initiate and lead.  Will the Taoiseach make that call today and tomorrow?

Politics in Ireland is remarkably different from politics in the United Kingdom on the issue of Brexit.  The work the Government has been doing on behalf of everybody here has, by and large, been supported very strongly by all parties even though we come from different places on so many different issues.  That has been hugely helpful.  I hope we can keep that intact over the summer months when Ireland needs to hold its nerve in the negotiations and keep the pressure on to ensure we protect Irish interests and the interests of Irish people on this island.  I assure the Deputy that is what we will do.  I spend the vast majority of my time thinking about and acting in the context of my responsibilities on Brexit.  I spent over an hour and a half this week with Michel Barnier talking through the detail of how we can approach the summer with a view to getting the results we need.  I will be in London next Wednesday meeting a series of British Ministers to talk through the concerns and frustrations we have.  Later today, I will take a phone call from a senior British Government Minister in that regard.  I assure the Deputy it is an absolute priority for the Government.  We have been frustrated and disappointed that the British Government has not delivered on the commitments it made to Ireland and the EU in December and March and in Prime Minister May's speeches, primarily the Mansion House speech.  Over the summer months, the challenge will be to intensify those efforts to find a way of putting in place a legal text that can be part of a withdrawal treaty that will deliver on the cast-iron political commitments that have been made in writing, not only to Ireland but also to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and many others.<\/p>  <p>  Most people understand why we have not made the kind of progress we would like to have made by now.  We are listening to the ongoing political debate at Westminster.  The British Government is essentially negotiating with itself.  Until that process comes to a conclusion it is difficult to make significant progress on some of the key and difficult political issues in the discussions between the British negotiating team and the EU task force led by Michel Barnier.  Our focus will remain on the negotiations and the technical detail that is required in terms of legal language to make sure that we will have a withdrawal agreement we can support.  As Michel Barnier has been, let me be very clear: there will be no withdrawal treaty if there is no legally operable text on the so-called Irish backstop.  It is a fundamental part of it.  The commitments have been made by the British side as well as the EU side that it will be accommodated as part of that treaty.  The treaty will not happen if that does not happen.  The challenge for me and many others is to work with the British Government as much as we can to try to find a way to achieve that outcome and to show some imagination in terms of how we get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800013#L00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1530184200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The backstop and the form it takes are crucial.  To allow those negotiations only to be decided upon at the time when everything else is in the melting pot is the wrong strategy for this country.  There are serious dangers in it.  The best strategy the Brits could have hoped for is that these issues would have been all dealt with together.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste a very simple question.  They have missed the deadline.  We expected serious progress.  They are now intending to roll this into October.  We need to take the initiative and inform European thinking.  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to make it very clear on the Government's behalf that there needs to be another deadline set and another Council summit and that we will not allow this to roll into October.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that the British Government is negotiating with itself and that this process needs to conclude.  That process may never conclude.  That is why we need to put firm deadlines in place.  The Minister For Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, stated on radio this morning that contingency plans are made for all scenarios including Britain crashing out of the EU.  When will the Government give certainty to people, commuters and businesses about what that means for the Border?  We know there were contingency plans previously developed by the Revenue, which looked at checks.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that if there is regulatory non-alignment there will need to be checks.

No country needs an agreement before October more than Britain does.  Ireland is second in line.  The damage to the British economy of a crash-out, no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic.  The fallout from that would also be very damaging for Ireland, which is why I do not believe we will have a no-deal Brexit.  That is why the focus has to be where it should be which is in the negotiating room in Brussels between senior British negotiators and the Barnier task force to tease through the complexity of the issues they face.  The British negotiating team needs direction from its political system to be able to do that.  We will hopefully see that after the next important meeting in the UK, which will happen at Chequers on Friday, 6 July.<\/p>  <p>  We have done an enormous amount of work on contingency.  We deliberately have not been speaking about it publicly because we do not believe it advances some of the negotiating positions we want to maintain.

Ireland has one of the world's most open economies but it also has one of the world's most open societies.  One in eight people living in this country was not born here.  Many vibrant cultures and ethnic communities make valuable contributions right across the island.  Membership of the European Union has widened the horizons of many people in Ireland, not least students who take part in the ERASMUS  programme.  Membership of the EU is not just about enjoying the benefits, however, it is also about taking shared responsibility for our part of the world and pooling our efforts into common solutions for the problems we collectively face.<\/p>  <p>  We have enjoyed EU-wide solidarity for Ireland's real concerns about Brexit and we have just heard about that again.  Just last week, EU Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, reiterated in this House the community solidarity and support for Ireland.  However, Brexit is not the only issue being discussed at the current European Council.  In fact, it is sixth on the agenda.  Migration will be the first issue to be discussed by the Heads of State in Brussels.  Our European partners are seeking to develop a comprehensive approach to migration, asylum seeking and control of the EU's external borders.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of migration should also be of concern to us.  Many lives have been lost as desperate people seek to cross the Mediterranean, some fleeing war or abuse, others simply seeking a better life as many thousands of Irish people did for generations.  Politically, we need to be at the heart of the EU when it comes to a humane response to these issues.  I have previously called for a Marshall plan for Europe's neighbourhood, to develop the economies in countries surrounding us in the Middle East and Africa.  In the short term, that would make the hazardous migration journeys less attractive and, in the long term, it would be in our interests in terms of expanding and growing trade.  Meanwhile, we need to show leadership on migration, integration and asylum right here and now in Ireland.  We cannot lecture others if we do not set things right here.  Too many people have had their lives put on hold for years as they struggle with the administrative barriers to full naturalisation in Ireland.  Given the scale of the migration crisis, it is time to take the action we need and to take it urgently.<\/p>  <p>  I have two questions for the T&aacute;naiste.  Does the Government agree that it is now time for a once-off general amnesty to take the few thousand people in direct provision off what is, by common consensus, an ineffective and inhumane system and to allow them to regularise their lives and work in Ireland?  Does the Government agree that we should do what we have spent years urging the United States Government to do for the undocumented Irish, which is to regularise the situation of undocumented migrants here in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800014#M00100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1530184800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>There were a lot of questions there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800014#M00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1530184800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>There were only two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800014#M00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1530184800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Let us see if the T&aacute;naiste can answer one of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800014#M00400","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1530184800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Deputy Howlin also made a lot of comments.  I am in very strong agreement with what he said regarding Africa in particular.  I have been making a very similar case at EU Council Foreign Affairs meetings.  The EU relationship with Africa needs to be the big new idea in the context of the future of Europe and its external policy.  We are going to witness a population growth of about an extra 1 billion people on that continent in the next 25 to 30 years.  Given the strains that Africa currently faces in the context of water security, food security, climate change, conflict, migration, political challenges and regional conflicts, the only way the EU can act responsibly is to dramatically increase its levels of ambition, politically as well as financially.  We should partner with Africa, rather than see it as a charity case.  Real, integrated partnership is the only way these issues will be solved in a manner that avoids a dramatic crisis in the future arising from the mass movement of people.<\/p>  <p>  As for the issues being discussed today, there will be a lot of debate on trying to get a collective agreement on the EU approach to migration.  I hope this will involve burden-sharing across the EU in order to ensure that Italy and other Mediterranean countries are not isolated and asked to carry an unfair share of the burden because of their geographic location.  I hope it will involve generosity, adherence to international law and accepted international humanitarian standards.  I hope it will also bring some predictability and order to how we collectively manage migration, which is clearly something of which many electorates in Europe are frightened.  These things are not easy to overcome, particularly in light of the difference of approach and perspective in the countries of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  From an Irish perspective, we need to lead by example and, today, the Taoiseach will offer a significant increase in Irish funding for an EU central fund for Africa.  He will provide more detail on the immediate assistance we are giving to Malta to accept 10% of the migrants on the ship currently there.  We are changing our own domestic approach towards asylum and direct provision and we are now allowing people who have been waiting for asylum decisions for nine months to work.  That means thousands of people will now be able to enter the workforce and that will be good for integration and well-being, as well as in a whole range of other areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy made a request for a once-off general amnesty but this would probably send out the wrong signal right now.

This is really good and we should be leading on the issue.  We should also be willing to contribute significantly to it.  Our moral authority to argue on any of these issues is greatly diminished as long as we have patently inadequate facilities for dealing with migrants into this country.  I do not agree that it would send out the wrong signal - something I have heard on many occasions - to regularise the few thousand people involved.  The number is, in comparison with what Spain, Italy, Greece or Malta is receiving, minuscule.  It would end direct provision and deal with people expeditiously as they arrive from now on.<\/p>  <p>  We should also regularise the undocumented, many of whom, or whose parents, we invited here.

Ireland was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage by means of a popular vote.<\/p><p>Although it can seem like Ireland is becoming a fully inclusive and open society, if one looks more closely, there remain systemic inequalities, particularly for the LGBTQI community.  This is because three years after the passing of the marriage equality referendum, Parts 2, 3 and, crucially, 9 of the Child and Family Relationships Act still have not been commenced, despite promises and commitments from the Government to do so.   Last week, the Taoiseach himself promised it would be done before the end of this D&aacute;il term.  <\/p> <p> The Child and Family Relationships Act 2015 was to provide vital legal recognition and rights for same-sex couples with children but it has fallen short due to the lack of commencement of those provisions.  It is astonishing that same-sex couples are still unable to register the name of one partner or spouse on their child's birth certificate.  That can have a huge impact on parental rights.  As a result of this Government's inaction, hundreds of families are being left in vulnerable situations, including children, while parents are not granted full parental rights.  Many are unable to obtain passports for their children or are left in limbo without the same rights or protections afforded to other families.  <\/p> <p> When will the Government fully recognise the diverse range of families in Ireland and protect them equally?  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Health that he is bringing in legislation seeking to commence Parts 2 and 3 of the Child and Family Relationships Act.  The Government is falling short again, however, by not also commencing Part 9, which is required alongside Parts 2 and 3 as it deals with the registration of birth amendments to the Civil Registration Act.  It will allow for Parts 2 and 3 to facilitate retrospective declarations of parentage.  To register the birth of a child, Part 9 will need to be commenced as well.

There are many causes of the high cost of insurance but one of them is the issue of claims harvesting.  It has become dominant in the market recently.  These are ordinary people, not solicitors, who set up websites giving the impression that they are solicitors and they tout for business in personal injury claims.  They then sell on that information and data to lawyers who pick up the claims.  It is unlawful and the Law Society has closed down 14 websites in the last three years and taken two major prosecutions to the High Court in respect of the leading websites.  It is still not enough.  We need robust regulation and reform in this sector.  When I ask the Minister, he says it is a grey area but these grey areas are pushing up costs on businesses, motorists and on home insurance.

To understand the purpose and benefit of the legislation, we have to be aware that it is unfortunately the case that sexual offences in Ireland are on the increase.  Yesterday, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, published its recorded crime figures for the first quarter of 2018.  Regrettably, those figures indicated that there was a 14.7% increase in sexual offences in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of the previous year.  The figures highlight, in particular, that 181 rapes were recorded in Ireland in the first quarter of the year, which is a worrying increase.  When the CSO figures for the final quarter of 2017 were examined and published three or four months ago, there was a 16.9% increase in sexual offences, with a 28.2% increase in rapes of a male or female.<\/p><p>The significant increase in sexual offences may be due to one of two reasons.  First, it could be because of public awareness, public information and public confidence.  People are becoming more willing to make complaints and to have sexual offences against them recorded.  That is one possible explanation.  Regrettably, there is another equally valid explanation, which is that sexual offences are significantly on the increase.  It would not be surprising if it was so when we consider the prevalence of pornography on the Internet and the extent to which young men, in particular, seem to be learning about sexuality from pornography on the Internet, which presents women in a very submissive and malleable form.  <\/p><p>We need to be conscious of the fact that sexual offences are on the increase, and it is in that context that this legislation is important.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide support to victims of sexual violence and gender-based violence in circumstances where they make a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Many people who have been through a court process where they have been the complainant in a rape or sexual offence trial state afterwards that they found the experience difficult, harrowing and surprising.  Part of the reason for that is the lack of information provided to complainants in the early stages of a criminal investigation.  The legislation will amend section 17 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 so that where a victim of sexual violence makes a complaint, they will be provided with relevant information and legal advice by a solicitor funded by the Minister, advising him or her of the process involved and the actions required  for criminal proceedings in respect of the alleged offence to be brought and heard.  <\/p><p>In practical terms, that means that complainant will have the opportunity to be advised by a solicitor at the earliest stage, first, on what the Garda investigation will involve and, second, on what the pre-trial process will involve.  They need to be informed that all the evidence accumulated will be provided to the accused.  Third, and most important, they need to be advised of the fact that for the prosecution to be maintained and to succeed the complainant will be required to give evidence and face cross-examination in respect of the allegation he or she has made.  There is protection on our Statute Book, which provides for separate legal representation to a complainant in a rape or sexual offence trial.  The complainant under this legislation will also be informed of that. <\/p><p>The legislation would be beneficial.  Somebody accused of rape or sexual offences has the State-funded protection of the free legal aid scheme from an early stage.  We should provide victims of sexual offences with similar forms of advice.  It would not be an expensive process.  It would be most appropriate if it was conducted through the parameters of the Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  It would also be beneficial to the criminal justice system.  Most important, it would be beneficial to the victims of sexual violence, gender-based violence and violence in a close relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800017#P00700","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1530186600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800017#P00800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1530186600,"counter":219,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800017#P00900","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530186600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1530186600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800017#P01100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1530186600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800017#P01200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530186600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Bail (Amendment) Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1530187200,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800018#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1530187200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division on Second Stage of the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2017.

It is timely to have this debate, as next month marks the first anniversary of the launch of the strategy by the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and me.  On taking up my role as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I was tasked with developing and implementing our new strategy.<\/p><p>I know first-hand of the devastation that the misuse of drugs and alcohol can cause to individuals, their families and local communities.  I have worked as a local Deputy and councillor in my community for nearly 20 years and long before that I worked in my community in a voluntary capacity.  I have met many people along the way whose lives have been destroyed by drugs and, sadly, I know of far too many who have lost their lives to drug addiction.  Their deaths have devastated their families; partners, parents and most of all their children.  In some cases, some of those who died were practically children themselves, young teenagers who got involved in drugs at a young age.  It is for all these reasons that I strongly support the adoption of a health-led response to substance misuse, one that focuses on minimising harm and promoting recovery and rehabilitation, which reduces drug-related deaths and gives people the support they need to live a healthier life.<\/p><p><i><\/i>The strategy is guided by a strong set of values, including compassion, respect, equity, inclusion and partnership.  It is evidence-informed.  During the public consultation carried out in advance of the new strategy, these values came to the fore and I am committed to progressing the implementation of our strategy with these values firmly at its core.<\/p><p>As a first step in implementing the strategy, I secured an additional &euro;6.5 million in the budget in 2018 for drug-related actions.  That is on top of the &euro;250 million spent every year on drug and alcohol services and programmes across all Departments and State agencies.  The &euro;6.5 million additional funding is being used to expand the availability of drug and alcohol treatment services.<\/p> <p> The main priority in 2018 is for the Health Service Executive to tackle pressure points in drug and alcohol treatment services and reduce waiting times.  New initiatives include the establishment of a treatment service in Kildare; the enhancement of treatment services in other areas, including Wexford, the midlands, Tipperary and Limerick; enhancement of the capacity of Cuan Dara unit to provide treatment on a national level for people with the most complex drug and alcohol dependency programmes; and the expansion of naloxone training for 300 people as well as the purchase of 1,300 naloxone kits.  In addition, an extra 200 people will be receiving Suboxone treatment, which can be an alternative to methadone, in 2018.<\/p> <p> A total of &euro;3.2 million has been allocated to the HSE in 2018 to facilitate the expansion of drug and alcohol services with a particular focus on strengthening governance structures and increasing access to opioid substitution treatment by reducing waiting times across community health organisation areas.  Further measures include the recruitment of four new clinical leads and three nursing managers, the recruitment of two new drug and alcohol liaison midwives in Cork and Limerick and the establishment of a step up, step down intermediate care facility for homeless people with drug and alcohol addictions.  A total of &euro;750,000 has been allocated to the HSE in 2018 to provide for the establishment of a supervised injecting facility in Dublin at Merchants Quay.<\/p> <p> I welcome each of these developments but I am fully aware that the demand for drug and alcohol treatment services remains high.  Through my regional visits and discussions with public representatives I am aware of the many worthwhile community projects seeking funding.  I have discussed these at my parliamentary party meeting last night and with many Deputies in the Chamber.  Members of the Seanad have raised the issue of funding of the taskforce as well.  I am pleased to announce funding of &euro;1 million to support and enhance services nationwide.  This funding will be allocated as follows: once-off funding of &euro;290,000 for taskforces in the fourth quarter of 2018, an allocation of &euro;10,000 for each local drugs and alcohol taskforce and &euro;15,000 for each regional drugs and alcohol taskforce.  I believe these latter groups need a little extra because they have a wider remit and a greater spread over the country.  Moreover, &euro;710,000 will be allocated by the HSE in consultation with the taskforces.  The taskforces will make recommendations for the funding of priority projects and services as well as new initiatives in the nine HSE community healthcare organisation areas.<\/p> <p> The Department of Health is developing two new programmes for at-risk young people in disadvantaged areas and community awareness of alcohol-related harm.  These programmes will each have funding of up to &euro;1 million in a full year.  These arise from specific commitments in the Department's Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery publication.  There will be a consultation process with the stakeholders to inform the development of the two programmes.<\/p> <p> Having more resources is only one part of the challenge.  We must also ensure that the money allocated for drug-related actions is spent wisely.  I am strongly of the view that the resources should be directed towards projects most likely to lead to a reduction in drug and alcohol use.  Measuring the effectiveness of responses to the drug problem is, therefore, a key objective of public policy.  I am keen to progress the performance management framework to which we have committed in the strategy.<\/p> <p> The health service is leading a two-pronged approach to address the hepatitis C issue.  The approach involves a combination of specialised treatments to treat the disease and a range of harm-reduction initiatives to reduce the incidence of the disease.  It is encouraging to see that the national hepatitis C treatment programme, which is run by the HSE from a budget of &euro;30 million, has facilitated some positive developments in recent years.  I understand that over 2,000 people have been successfully provided with treatment for hepatitis C since 2015.  Moreover, all persons infected with hepatitis C through contaminated blood and blood products have been offered treatment as at the end of 2017.<\/p> <p> In February of this year, it was announced that Merchants Quay Ireland would deliver Ireland's first medically supervised injecting facility in Dublin city centre on a pilot basis.  This facility will help to prevent injury and death and will connect people with health services.  It will also help to make our streets safer.<\/p> <p> There is a strong overlap between addiction and homelessness.  We have taken action to address the health needs of people who are homeless in line with Rebuilding Ireland.  This includes the provision of funding for an intermediate care step up, step down facility in Dublin run by the Dublin Simon Community for people who are homeless and who require nursing and related care prior to hospital admission and post discharge from hospital.<\/p> <p> The drug and alcohol taskforces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem and in initiating appropriate responses.  They strive for a co-ordinated approach involving all sectors relevant to the problem of substance misuse in local communities.  The taskforces are instrumental in harnessing the efforts of community groups, families and residents in identifying problem drug use and in building partnerships with the community and voluntary sector, statutory services and local representatives to address them.  Taskforces actively support and promote the participation of service users and their families, including those in recovery, in local decision-making structures and networks as well as in feeding into regional and national decision-making structures.  I secured additional funding of &euro;250,000 in budget 2018 to improve the organisational effectiveness of the taskforces in implementing the national drugs strategy.  The Department is currently processing the applications for this funding with a view to issuing approvals over the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> The impact of drugs goes far beyond individuals.  They impact on wider society.  Drugs are strongly linked to criminal activity.  We are all aware of the consequences of gangland feuds and how they can impact on local communities.  The Government commissioned the Mulvey report on the north-east inner city to address this issue.  There is now a project implementation board reporting to the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is seeking to improve the reduction in criminality and improve living conditions in the area.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that many people in local communities live in fear due to drug-related intimidation.  It is one of my priorities to help communities and protect them from intimidation because of drug use.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the family support network are looking at whether the current reporting system is working.<\/p> <p> I am concerned, however, that criminal convictions for the possession of drugs can impact on a young person's life.  For this reason, I set up a working group to look at alternative responses for personal possession of drugs.  The group is due to report to me by the end of 2018.  The working group is now asking the public for views.  To date, there have been 16,000 responses to the online consultation from a broad spectrum of the population.  It is encouraging to see people from all walks of life having their say on this important issue for society.  Everyone will have had a chance to give views and outline experiences to the working group.  This input will shape the recommendations we receive.  I look forward to receiving the report from the working group and bringing it to Government at the end of the year.<\/p> <p> On average, three people die each day as a result of drinking alcohol.  Nearly four out of ten Irish people binge drink regularly.  The Government is committed to reducing the widespread harm and pain that alcohol causes to those who engage in harmful drinking and to others who are affected.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill sets out a number of measures to reduce the substantial harm alcohol causes in society.  It is clear that the Department of Health and the Government are taking a pro-active and multifaceted approach to our drug and alcohol problems.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputies for their engagement and I look forward to hearing their views.  I thank the community groups and NGOs I have met through my journeys throughout the country.  I thank them for the support they have given me in implementing the national drugs strategy.  I thank the oversight forum and the standing committee, both of which are doing tremendous work on the national drugs strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800019#V00200","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530188100,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy John Curran.  We intend to take five minutes each.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to be able to speak on this issue.  I am pleased that the new national drugs strategy was published last year.  I was previously the spokesperson on drugs for the party.  That role has been taken over by Deputy Stephen Donnelly, but I am glad to speak on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister of State has tried to initiate a health-led approach in this area and that she is engaging in a public consultation process.  That is something I and my party support.  It is important that we remove the criminal code from those who have an addiction.  They should not be triaged and processed through the criminal justice system.  They should be given care, support and compassion through our health system.<\/p><p> That is where it stops because our health system is not currently calibrated to help those people.  Even if we tried to initiate a health-led approach, despite positive changes in some areas and increases in funding, we could not take on the number of those suffering addition, whether drugs or alcohol.  Over the coming months, the system must be calibrated to try to initiate a health-led approach.  Putting more people behind bars for personal possession will not help them.  I was disappointed that the Minister of State did not mention prison as an issue because one of the biggest problems is addiction and mental health issues in prisons.  Much of that relates to the cycle of addition to drugs and alcohol and the deprivation those people have experienced in their lives.  We need a specific focus in the national drugs strategy on the prison population, the majority of whom have had serious problems with addiction which is only reinforced in our prison system, where they are not helped.  She needs to address that in the coming months.<\/p> <p> As Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on drugs, I have visited the Tiglin residential treatment centre, Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; Aislinn centre in Kilkenny, and the Rutland Centre as well as many local and regional drugs and alcohol task forces.  Many of these groups do admirable work in the most testing of environments with tight budgets.  These people do significant work and it is important we recognise that in the debate.  <\/p> <p> When the national drugs strategy was unveiled in July 2017, I welcomed it but said that there needed to be more than a glossy launch.  I said it was imperative that it delivered real and tangible results for communities.  My fear was that it would be another strategy that made all the right noises but we would not see the right approach in our public health system.  Public health strategy around drugs and alcohol is a microcosm of our health service generally.  We have the right strategies and approach, the Government is doing the right thing in consulting the public, but when it comes to services there has not been a real and tangible improvement.  The people I speak to on the ground are facing significant budgetary tightening along with increased demand for their services.    <\/p> <p> What has happened in the past 12 months?  How many people have died from drug overdoses?  How many lives have been destroyed by substance abuse?  What is the net impact of 12 months of inaction?  The health system has not been rebalanced to help people with addictions to the extent that is needed.  The Government will be glad that there are no statistics for this year as I fear they would show no improvement.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of death by overdose.  My party and I welcome the Government's action to pilot an injecting centre, which allows intervention for people should they overdose.  Ireland has the highest rate of intravenous heroin use in Europe and, as a consequence, the rate of drug-related death is three times the European average.  Two people die from drug-related deaths every day in Ireland.  This is unacceptable and the figures, unfortunately, show no signs of improving. <\/p> <p> We need to look at a public health-led approach to tackling addiction and I welcome the changes being introduced in this regard.  Fianna F&aacute;il will engage proactively with the Government's public consultation.  <\/p> <p> The expansion of local community-led drug projects and needs-based services is a crucial element of the challenge to curb Ireland's drug crisis.  However, many social workers and community drug support teams tell me that this expansion has not happened over the past 12 months.  The Minister of State referred to the homelessness crisis.  Those figures have not improved at all. People who have exited addiction say their complex needs are not currently being met in respect of accommodation or accessing health services.  I recognise that is the strategy's focus but we have not seen outcomes.  <\/p> <p> I welcome that Suboxone and Naloxone are being progressed, which I called for, but it needs to be expanded beyond the current numbers.  They will do a great deal to help people.  The issue of methadone being the end point or cul-de-sac for many with addiction must also be addressed.  It is an important weaning mechanism but treatment must progress beyond it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800020#W00200","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530188700,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and the Minister of State's opening statement.  Implementing a national drugs strategy requires the leadership of a Minister but also requires a whole-of-Government response.  I am disappointed that it has taken a year from the launch of the strategy until now for us to have this debate.  This debate should have happened much sooner and there should have been an emphasis on the implementation of that programme.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, the Minister of State's opening statement gave rise to hope.  It is well acknowledged that those seeking treatment experience better outcomes when the treatments are delivered in their communities.  The work, projects and programmes developed over many years by both local and regional drug and alcohol task forces need to be acknowledged.  One concern I have is that in a direct reply to me earlier this year, the Minister of State said:<\/p><blockquote>In excess of &euro;27.6 million in funding has been allocated to task forces by the Department of Health and the HSE for community-based drug initiatives this year.  This level of funding is consistent with the amounts provided in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.<\/blockquote><p>We have come through a difficult time but I am concerned that while the budgets of both the HSE and the Department of Health during that period have increased, the task forces have been left behind.  That has caused problems because they are forced to provided diminished services with reduced funding.  They are in competition for staff.  People who work on these projects as counsellors and so on are finding alternative work elsewhere through other publicly-funded projects, some of which may be funded by the HSE.  I welcome that the Minister of State announced an additional &euro;1 million funding, with &euro;10,000 for local task forces and &euro;15,000 for regional task forces.  However my concern is that it is once-off funding.  If they are going to provide any continuity of services, task forces need an annual funding base.  They need certainty on funding because these programmes cannot be turned on and off.<\/p><p>Later this year, the Minister of State is developing a new programme to promote community awareness of alcohol-related harm.  In that regard, &euro;250,000 will be made available in 2018 for phase 1 and &euro;1 million next year, which will be divided among the various task forces.  This funding is grossly inadequate.  I am sure there will be funding for other alcohol-related issues but she should consider the amount spent on road safety awareness.  When one compares the number of accident fatalities with drug-related deaths, we are not putting the same level of effort into prevention and awareness.  Allocating &euro;250,000 to all local and regional task forces and &euro;1 million in a full year will not be sufficient to do what we expect it to do.  I ask the Minister of State to review this realistically.  <\/p><p>I agree with the comment of my colleague Deputy Chambers regarding methadone.  For too long, people have been prescribed methadone.  It has played an important role and has brought a degree of stability to people's lives.  However, many people have been left on methadone programmes indefinitely.  There must be better progression and long-term outcomes, and other alternatives need to be sought.  I am not critical that people have entered programmes, but I am critical that enough people are not progressing through them and exiting.<\/p><p>Finally, the Minister of State mentioned the garda&iacute; and the issues of serious crime.  I acknowledge that the Garda has been successful in some high profile intelligence-led operations.  However,  I am concerned that divisional drug units which have all been reduced in size.  While well-known figures are arrested and big seizures are taking place, my concern relates to those who are dealing in our communities and on street corners.  I am regularly contacted by constituents about this and I am sure the Minister of State has the same experienced but divisional drugs squads are not as large as they used to be.  While it is not directly the responsibility of the Minister of State's Department, she has responsibility for national drugs strategy, which requires a whole-of-Government response.  This issue needs to be addressed because I am seeing more and more drug dealing in public and that needs to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800021#X00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1530189300,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The national drugs strategy document, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, is another fine document among many dealing with a substance misuse problem that has, unfortunately, been part of the fabric of our society for a number of generations.  Drug addiction has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people across the country and has affected society at every level.  No one, no social group and no demographic is immune from the issues of substance misuse.  However, addiction is a problem that has particularly affected marginalised communities which have experienced widespread social and economic deprivation.<\/p>  <p>  Drug and alcohol addictions will continue to adversely affect all aspects of community life because of the unfortunate reality that, while this current strategy has many commendable aspirations and goals, its lacks the teeth to implement them fully.  Simply put, we need more investment.  The once-off funding of &euro;290,000 across all task forces for the fourth quarter of 2018 to which the Minster of State referred is simply not enough.  The Minister of State also mentioned &euro;710,000 to be allocated by the HSE.  While this is welcome, it is essential that each task force avails of it and decides on its use.  I have visited many groups and organisations across the city that have been at the coalface in terms of dealing with the substance misuse problem over the past year and they have told me that this lack of funding is a serious problem for them.  My own involvement with the Finglas Cabra Drug and Alcohol Task Force, which incidentally, receives proportionately even less funding than other such groups in the country, tells me that all the fine words, reports and aspirations are meaningless if the groups are not given adequate funding to implement these strategies.  Increases in funding in more recent years have not even brought funding levels back to the levels prior to 2007 and 2008, years in which significant cuts were made to funding for drugs and alcohol task forces.  The resulting cuts in funding had a hugely negative impact on service provision and continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the general concepts of the strategy, we can all agree that drug and alcohol misuse are primarily public health issues.  Sinn F&eacute;in would equally support and advocate an holistic approach to prevention, rehabilitation and recovery.  Strategies for those in treatment must include proper access to accommodation, education, vocational training, employment and, most importantly, childcare.   There is also a need to increase employment opportunities.  That requires working in partnership with trade unions, employer organisations and Government agencies helping those in recovery to rebuild their lives and integrate back into their communities.  However, none of this can be done, or done adequately, without significant investment, even just to restore services cut at the time of the economic crash without even taking into account inflation since then.<\/p>  <p>  While there is much to comment on in the strategy, I welcome the fact that it gives consideration to issues concerning mental health, mental illness and co-morbid substance misuse.  I recently visited the HSE's Keltoi centre.  This is an award-winning substance misuse and trauma residential treatment centre at St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park.  Keltoi has developed programmes that work with people presenting with mental illness and co-morbid substance misuse.  I would strongly suggest that organisations such as Keltoi, which have the experience and the programmes, be given a role in the development of the mental health dual diagnosis programme envisaged in the Minister of State's drugs and alcohol strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Substance misuse is an ever-evolving scourge on society.  Our children are being groomed to be couriers.  The introduction of drugs such as crack cocaine, meth and other highly-toxic substances into communities has led to a near breakdown in society in other jurisdictions.  These drugs are now coming into Ireland.  We need the investment and resources to combat them.  Society needs to be vigilant and we, as legislators, also need to be vigilant.  While this document goes some way to recognising these concerns, it lacks bite when it comes to delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800022#Y00100","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1530189300,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I am a member and director of the Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum.  In Limerick we call it a forum rather than a task force.  The drug and alcohol forum in Limerick funds a number of groups, some of which I would like to mention.  The Minister of State met with a number of them when she was in Limerick.  The Community Substance Misuse Team deals with young people with addiction problems.  The Northstar Family Support Project deals with families who are affected by a family member&rsquo;s substance misuse.  One of the groups of which I am really proud is the Limerick city community network.  It is a voluntary group comprising people from across the communities, particularly in Limerick city, who come together.  They receive no funding but are supported by the task force.  Other groups that do great work in Limerick which I would like to mention include Palls, Ana Liffey, the Saoirse Addiction Treatment Centre and Novas Initiatives.  I commend the Minister of State for the public consultation she carried out in Limerick.  It was very positive.<\/p>  <p>  I am not 100% in favour of the strategy but I wish the Minister of State well with it.  Unfortunately, I do not believe the strategy will work because the additional necessary funding is not there to tackle what is a huge problem across the State, particularly in parts of my own constituency of Limerick City.  The misuse of drugs in Limerick is increasing almost daily.  The continued failure to properly resource those working on the front line to tackle the scourge of drug addiction is simply not acceptable and is not sustainable.  The problem worsens.<\/p>  <p>  Local groups and people in Limerick I have worked with and spoken to recently - some of them today -  describe the extent of cocaine use in the city as unprecedented.  I am hearing stories of very young people being deliberately targeted and used as guinea pigs for mixtures of heroin and cocaine.  Crack cocaine is sometimes mixed with cocaine to get these young people immediately hooked on that drug.  As the Minister of State is well aware, this is a recipe for disaster.  The groups in Limerick I mentioned earlier are having a real positive effect on people&rsquo;s lives every day but they are starved of funding as the forum is not properly resourced.  Limerick does not, for instance, have a detox centre.  Most services will say that they have a huge waiting list and that their staff are under huge pressure to deliver basic services.<\/p>  <p>  Official statistics show a rise of almost 25% in the total number of people treated for illegal drug use between 2009 and 2013 across the State.  It is estimated that upwards of 1,000 people in Limerick are addicted to heroin alone.  The Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum has taken cuts of more than 50% since 2008.  Funding in 2018 sees no real increase from what was allocated in 2017.  Over the years these cuts have impacted massively on, and prevented, the delivery of drug and alcohol services that are urgently needed in Limerick and across the entire mid-west region.  Failure to allocate additional funding means the problem will continue.<\/p>  <p>  The drug task force was established to address the growing alcohol and drugs issues facing the region, especially the city, and yet it has lost more than half of its funding since 2008.  It funds a large number of local projects but is now under sustained pressure due to cuts over the years.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to restore some of the massive cuts it has imposed on those working in the fight against drugs in Limerick and nationally over the years is shameful and shows how out of touch it is on the issue.  Even in the boom times, successive Governments did not devote anywhere near enough resources to ensure that we could tackle the blight of drug abuse.  Now is the time to invest in doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The city of Limerick clearly has a worsening drugs problem.  Heroin, the excessive use of alcohol, gambling and the misuse of prescription drugs are causing huge problems across the city and wider region.  In the mid-west, the drugs and alcohol forum has provided a drugs project worker who works with students across the third-level institutions in Limerick - the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology and Mary Immaculate College.  This has been hugely successful and the Minister of State should look at trying rolling this out at across the country.  It is working really well.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise with the Minister of State an issue that is brought to my attention constantly.  It is the issue of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  People are furious that drugs dealers can flaunt their wealth without fear or favour. They ask how these known drug dealers, who have no visible means of income, can drive quality vehicles.  They also ask how their children and relatives can drive similarly expensive vehicles and how can these individuals - again, with no visible signs of support - enjoy the villa-type homes in which they live, often in council estates.  How can they afford multiple holidays a year, as can be seen in the photos and itineraries they display on their Facebook pages, while their tax-paying neighbours struggle to pay bills?  How can these individuals have the type of social life that has them drinking in well-known hostelries in Limerick most nights of every single week?  It is time for the activities of CAB to be expanded in Limerick and for the Government to amend the Proceeds of Crime Acts to ensure money seized by CAB goes back into local communities affected by drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State announced a few additional grants.  I plead with her to allocate that money directly to the task forces.  They should not be put through the hoops of filling out application forms, which I understand are already causing problems that the task forces do not have time to deal with.<\/p><p>The money, if divided among all the task forces, including local task forces, is a small amount.  The Minister of State should just allocate it to each one and do so as soon as she can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800022#Y00200","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530189900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's comments.  We should not be debating the new drugs strategy a year after it was launched.  It is kind of crazy.  There is so much talk about the need to address this issue and we are debating the strategy a year late.  We talk a lot about new politics but this is as an example of where it is not working.<\/p>  <p>  The new national drugs strategy is rightly called Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, and I welcome the shift in tone towards caring for people who suffer from addiction, which is an illness.  Therefore, it makes sense to take a health-led approach to the drugs issue but we must not underestimate the scale of the challenge.<\/p>  <p>  The number of cases of people in treatment for drug addiction has increased steadily since 2007.  Back then, there were 5,259 people in treatment for addiction, not including alcohol.  In 2015, that figure was 9,710.  That is an increase of 84%.  The number of new cases each year has also gone up, from 2,431 cases in 2007 to 3,650 cases in 2015, representing an increase of 50%.  These are just the people in treatment.  We know that many more people are affected by addiction but are not included in these numbers.  Some are not because they do not want to admit to or make public their use of illegal drugs.  They do not want to show the impact drugs have had on them.  Others are not included because the State simply does not offer them any services.  Therefore the number is far higher than recorded.<\/p>  <p>  The issue concerning the figures is that the services are not at the same level outside Dublin or one or two other main urban areas.  I say this as a Tipperary Deputy.  I welcome in particular that the Department of Health engaged in a much more comprehensive consultation process on the strategy this time round .  It is important that the Department continue to engage in serious listening exercises because drug use has changed and it is affecting people across Ireland in new ways.  The Department needs to continue to listen to how addiction is affecting communities and families across Ireland.  This is not an problem specific to one period but is iterative and continuing.<\/p>  <p>  We used to see the drugs issue as concentrated in urban areas where there was a concentration of social housing.  Now the drugs issue is nationwide.  Proportionately, villages and rural areas may be even more affected by addiction than some urban areas.  I am not sure if anyone has said that before in this House.  Some villages in rural counties probably have a higher percentage of drug abuse than inner city Dublin.  There is a smaller sample but a bigger problem proportionately.  <\/p>  <p>  The level of service provision in the State is nowhere near that required to tackle the addiction issue.  The new strategy will need to be backed up by serious investment in services if even half of the intended actions are going to be implemented.  Otherwise it is just wishful thinking.  Ireland's level of opioid addiction, to heroin among other substances, is much higher than in other western European countries.  Opioid addiction affects seven in every 1,000 people here, compared with four in every 1,000 across Europe.  <\/p>  <p>  Most of the State's infrastructure for dealing with drug addiction is focused on opioids.  This has been the case since the heroin epidemic of the 1980s.  In addition to that serious problem, the situation on the ground has moved on.  Cocaine and crack cocaine are prevalent and highly addictive.  We have few detoxification and rehabilitation options for people.  Amphetamines, cannabis and ecstasy are all widely used.  There also continues to be abuse of solvents.  People are becoming addicted to sedatives or tranquilisers, which they may or may not have acquired on prescription. <\/p>  <p>  Drug dealing has changed too, with people ordering drugs online through so-called dark web websites, and even getting drugs delivered by post.  This kind of thing has spread addiction to every corner of Ireland, including every village.  There is a risk of drug addiction becoming totally out of control unless the Government puts in the necessary resources to get a grip on the issue.  There is obviously a divide between legal and illegal drugs in this mix.  We could mention tobacco and alcohol, which are legal, are also associated with addiction.<\/p>  <p>  One of the actions under the national strategy is for the consultation on the potential decriminalisation of the personal possession of illegal drugs.  This consultation is currently ongoing.  I understand that more than 14,000 submissions from the public have been received to date.  I welcome this because it is clear evidence, if any were needed, of the level of public interest in and concern over the issue of drug misuse.<\/p>  <p>  The most important point I want to make to the Minister of State is that there is a real opportunity for Ireland to take a new approach to the whole issue of addiction.  One does not often get to spend much time in government but if there is one issue regarding which the Minister of State has an opportunity, it is this.  Countries such as Portugal have achieved a major reduction in the use of opioids and much fewer drug-related deaths because they changed strategy.  There is something wrong, however, with the focus on the question of what substances should be legal or illegal.  That is not the real issue; the real issue is how we treat people who have an addiction.  The Labour Party's proposal is that we should decriminalise the person who is addicted to drugs.  It should not be a criminal offence to be in possession of a small amount of soft drugs when one is addicted to them.  Fear of a criminal record should never stop a person from seeking the medical help he or she needs.  The vicious drugs gangs involved in drug dealing of course need to remain outside the law.  Garda resources should be freed up to deal with them.  At present, by contrast, Garda time is taken up with minor cases where people who are addicted to drugs are found in possession of small quantities.  If we make it clear that possession of drugs by addicts will not be a criminal offence, we can focus on getting people into treatment for addiction.  In Portugal, people are offered the choice of medical and social supports instead of getting a criminal record and facing a judicial sentence, which hangs over them for the rest of their lives.  This is the option we should be discussing for Ireland but it will not work if there are not the services put in place to help people deal with addiction.<\/p>  <p>  A wide range of services is needed to deal with different types of drug addiction and different groups of people.  For example, different services are needed for long-term heroin users compared with services for young people.  The real test of the national drugs strategy will be whether the Government is ready to put the serious resources into the front-line services that actually help people to escape from addiction and to move forward with their lives.<\/p>  <p>  Massive cuts were implemented in services since 2008 and none of the funding has been restored proportionately.  Staff working in drugs services have had their pay cut and frozen.  Since they are in the community and voluntary sector, funded through section 39, about which we all know, they are not getting the pay restoration that public servants are getting in the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Rent costs and insurance costs have increased and many of the services are on their knees.  At the same time, as I said at the outset, the number of people presenting to services with drug addiction problems has grown enormously.<\/p>  <p>  Simply decriminalising substances in the absence of funding for addiction services would be a dereliction of duty by the Government and the Minister of State and would lead to anarchy.  There is a need for the creation of proper working conditions for those who provide addiction services.  They need proper working conditions like me, the Minister of State and everyone else.  There should be some standardisation among addiction workers to ensure minimum quality standards.  That would involve a lot of training and the development of addiction practitioners.  It would also have to include pay grades and career opportunities equivalent to those enjoyed by HSE workers.  That is simply not the case now.  It is part of the problem when it comes to the provision of services because we cannot get the people.  <\/p>  <p>  The new national drugs strategy is going to be health-led but the HSE is not in a position to lead on this topic.  We need to think outside the box because if we just throw it in as part of the mix of what the HSE is meant to be doing, we will still be here.  We will have a nice, shiny document but no implementation.  Therefore, we need to think outside the box and create a different format and pathway for dealing with this issue.<\/p>  <p>  There are political challenges to do with drug addiction that require clear political leadership.  This returns me to my point that we do not always get to be in government for long.  This is the opportunity of the Minister of State, who I acknowledge has a passion for this issue.  She should please try to deal with it.  She needs to deal with it and put up the money to develop addiction services.  She should put in place the right format and the right organisation and should ensure it provides services nationwide and not just in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Services in many of the prisons are simply not working. <\/p><p>The number of prisoners addicted to drugs who are not being provided with the services they need will become a significant issue.  I also believe many of the people working in the Prison Service are being treated appallingly where they have to deal with prisoners in this situation but the backup services are not available.  When they do find people in possession of drugs, sometimes they feel they are the ones who are getting into more trouble than those who are bringing them in or carrying them within the prisons.  The whole issue of drugs in prisons, how those who work in the Prison Service are being treated and the lack of services has been left behind.  It will blow up in our faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800023#Z00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530190500,"counter":243,"content":"<p>This debate has been going on for years but, frustratingly, it seems to have stalled.  There is much talk but no action.  I am glad 14,000 submissions have been received so far in the public consultation on the law on possession of drugs for personal use.  I look forward to the report being completed by October.  Hopefully, the recommendations can consider some of the issues around personal drug use.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to commend the critical roles played by community drug projects and local drug task forces, which continue to deliver a fantastic service in their communities, even though their budgets have been cut by 37% over the past eight years.  These cuts have led to dramatic changes in what they can give to their communities.  I have seen this for myself in Clondalkin.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy of criminalising people for drug use has been an abject failure.  There is a catchword that the war on drugs has been a failure.  In fact, it has been an abject failure.  It just does not work.  It has failed communities and judicial systems.  One must look at a radical approach to dealing with drug use and what that entails.  Whether we like it, people will continue to use drugs.  They used drugs generations ago and generations to come will continue to do so.  Do we criminalise them?  No, we should not.  People found with drugs for personal use should not go through the criminal justice system because it has failed.  In my community, I have seen the abuse of drugs ravage not only friends of mine but family members.  I have seen whole communities destroyed.  What it does to people&rsquo;s mindsets acts like a cancer in communities.  Words cannot articulate what drugs do and what they leave behind.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody is born a heroin addict but, sometimes, addiction chooses people.  When heroin gets a hold of a person, it is a difficult drug from which to get away.  Some people do and others do not.  Friends of mine have passed away due to heroin addiction.  I know others who got away from addiction and have done very well.  They have children and good jobs.  Sometimes, regardless of whether we like it, drugs take hold of people.  In the debate on drugs, I have always heard that cannabis is a gateway to harder drugs.  That is absolute rubbish.  The gateway to heroin, crack and all the drugs which bring misery, is alienation and poverty.  I accept people who have chronic heroin problems probably smoked hash.  However, it just does not lead on to harder drugs.  I know many people who smoke cannabis but will never touch heroin, crack, cocaine and so forth.  We need a radical approach in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Decriminalisation, as the previous Deputy said, decriminalises the person rather than the drugs.  In 2001, Portugal decriminalised drugs for personal use.  A person found with a particular drug on them for personal use will not go through the criminal justice system but will be given counselling, health-led products and assistance with harm reduction.  Last year, 80% of drug-related offences in this State were for personal use, meaning 10,000 people have gone through the criminal justice system because of personal use of drugs.  That is a complete waste of time for the criminal justice system and the police.  The police at the front line in the war on drugs will admit that it is failing them and civil society and that we need a new approach.  Decriminalisation is one approach to that.<\/p>  <p>  If people who are found in possession of drugs for personal use get a criminal record, this will have a profound effect on their future job prospects.  I know people who were caught 15 years ago with a small amount of cannabis but still have a drug offence record.  I remember going to a festival 15 years ago at which undercover police were looking for people with a small possession of cannabis and arresting them.  It was ridiculous.  Obviously, civic society has moved on and we cannot criminalise people for cannabis use in particular because it is a complete waste of time.  Decriminalisation of drugs is inevitable.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will have to look at the whole range of drugs contained in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  Classifying cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug having no medical or recreational use is ridiculous.  For example, this year the Minister for Health granted a licence for medical cannabis that involved the raw form of cannabis.  It meant the person was basically granted a licence for a bag of grass.  That is a fact.  While I am glad the Minister granted a licence to a person in the State for the medical use of cannabis, it is classified as a Schedule 1 drug.<\/p>  <p>  More controversially, all illicit drugs are controlled by criminal individuals or gangs who do extremely well out of selling drugs.  They have big cars, holidays and so forth.  The war on drugs has been a failure.  Society must look at ways of taking drugs out of the hands of criminal gangs and individuals and to take them back.  These gangs are unregulated and do not care what they sale.  They sell to children, individuals die from using their drugs and communities are destroyed by them.  We must look at the legalisation of some drugs.  This is a nuanced argument which some people will find difficult.  I also believe we will need to look at a more radical approach than decriminalisation.  My starting point is whether this will save somebody's life.  If it can, then it is worth approaching and looking at.  At present, hundreds of people die of overdoses, use opiates or are affected by drugs.<\/p><p>If we can cut that by half, by any means, and if we can save one life by decriminalisation, regulation and legalisation of some drugs, we can have a different approach to this issue.

A few people have contacted me to say there should have been a debate on the issue earlier because the national drugs strategy has been in place for over a year, so I am pleased it is taking place.  I am pleased - I know the task force is also happy - to see the progress of the working group on alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use and the high level of response to the public consultation process.  Over 14,000 submissions - over 16,000 now according to the Minister of State's report - have been made to date.  I know from my contact with Addiction Response Crumlin, my role on the Canal Communities Local Drugs Task Force and contact with other community network groups that they look forward to the report of the working group being completed by October, as indicated by the Minister of State, and its recommendations being considered promptly by the Government in order that issues of addiction and drug use are no longer treated as criminal issues but health issues, in line with the commitments in the national drugs strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The community drug projects continue to develop and deliver a wide range of services across treatment and harm reduction; rehabilitation and recovery; young people and children's services; family support services; and awareness and support programmes in schools, clubs and communities as they respond to every kind of drug use that people present with, including heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, hash, weed, benzos and tablets, new psychoactive substances, NPS, steroids, amphetamines and alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the Canal Communities Local Drugs Task Force's monthly meeting on Monday.  A crucial part of the two-hour meeting involved breaking into groups, dividing the national drugs strategy into five areas or groups.  Each group had to devise strategies on how to implement the national drugs strategy into the projects and the task force.  It was a really good exercise except for the fact that we were advised there would be no definitive figures on extra garda&iacute; - community garda&iacute;, drugs garda&iacute; - coming into the jurisdiction in the coming period.  This is a key area that is not just for the Department of Justice and Equality but for Deputy Byrne, as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, in ensuring that the community garda&iacute; and the drugs garda&iacute; get the resources they need to assist the communities and work with them, not above them.<\/p>  <p>  The projects have struggled through the devastation of seven years of funding cuts, with an overall cut of 37% to the drugs initiative budget between 2008 and 2014, and have seen no increases to their budgets from 2014 to 2017 or to their wages, which has been mentioned already.  The workers in the task forces come under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 and are not getting the increases that other public services are receiving, yet their funding was cut as promptly and as quickly as that of those workers back in 2011-12.  This is despite a significant additional allocation of &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million to the drugs initiative budget for 2018.  However, none of this additional funding is currently set to be allocated to the community drugs projects that are on the front line of delivering services to our communities.  This is completely unjustifiable and needs to be remedied immediately.  I see from the Minister of State's report that she has now sourced other moneys for the fourth quarter of 2018, &euro;10,000 each for the local drugs and alcohol task forces and &euro;15,000 for each regional drugs and alcohol task force.  Is this on top of the announcement she has already made about the &euro;10,000 going to the task forces?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800025#BB00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1530191100,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800025#BB00300","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1530191100,"counter":247,"content":"<p>That is good and will be welcomed, but it is still not enough and does not bring funding back to the level in 2007 and 2008, before the 37% cut in funding to the services.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated in the foreword to the national drugs strategy that the Government \"recognises the importance of supporting the participation of communities in key decision making structures [of the national drugs strategy] so that their experience and knowledge informs the development of solutions to solve problems related to substance misuse in their areas\". Despite this commitment of An Taoiseach, all the key decisions, such as the prioritisation of actions and allocation of resources, continue to be made at a centralised agency and at departmental level and not by the interagency structures set up as part of the national drugs strategy, resulting in the effective exclusion of communities from any meaningful decision-making process.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's Department should appoint a senior official to the national drugs strategy's national structures to support the role of the Department of Health in ensuring direct accountability of all agencies at national, regional and local level for their active participation in implementing the new national drugs strategy through the agreed mechanism of the partnership interagency structures.  Furthermore, the new national drugs strategy recognises the central role of drug and alcohol task forces in co-ordinating the delivery of the strategy at local and regional level.  However, in 2018, the additional allocation to each task force is limited to the sum of &euro;10,000 - that is what we had got in the previous announcement - for the entire task force area.  This extra funding will go some way in helping but is still not enough for the work they are do on the front line.  The task forces must be supported and resourced to carry out this role and to respond effectively to their local needs, whether it be the community drug problems in disadvantaged areas, the growing drug problems in towns outside Dublin or the often hidden drug use in rural areas.  Each task force must be given an immediate mandate to develop a three-year action plan that sets out how the national drugs strategy actions will be implemented in its local or regional area through a collective interagency partnership response, and that &euro;10,000 and the extra money must be increased.<\/p>  <p>  I will make three final points.  Drug-related intimidation continues to be reported from all parts of the country and is having a particularly damaging and insidious impact on a number of marginalised communities with a concentration of serious problem drug use.  The national drugs strategy document states that the NDS structures will develop and monitor responses to drug-related intimidation as a matter of priority.  Families are being devastated by this.  This commitment must be acted on immediately by bringing together all the relevant stakeholders at the highest level to develop an action plan specific to the challenges of addressing drug-related intimidation.<\/p>  <p>  There is no clear indication as to how an integrated strategy on drugs and alcohol is to be implemented, and this discussion needs to take place on the national committees as a matter of urgency with all the partners engaged.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which has been called for desperately by all the task forces and all the community networks, should be passed without further delay.<\/p>  <p>  These are some of the key areas the task forces have raised with me in recent days and they wanted me to raise them here.  I hope the Minister of State can respond to some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800025#BB00400","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1530191100,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak in this debate.  It is just a pity there are so few Deputies present.  Perhaps that has something to do with the timing of the debate.  It would have been nice to see it more centre stage.  I wish to contribute to the debate as a long-standing member of the Ballymun Local Drugs Task Force.  I have also had an involvement in the Finglas Cabra Local Drug &amp;amp; Alcohol Task Force.<\/p>  <p>  The drugs strategy was established in 1998.  I think it is true to say that at this stage in the development of the response to drugs, there are still a huge number of gaps in it and in some ways we have gone backwards.  I read the statement the Taoiseach made this time last year when the new strategy was launched.  He spoke about the republic of opportunity and said that, if it is to be meaningful, it must apply to all.  However, I suspect that in the meantime very few people who have been excluded through addiction feel any sense of this being a Republic for them because not much progress has been made in implementing the strategy.  There are 50 actions set out in the strategy.  Most of the task forces, I think, are serious about taking on these actions and have no choice but to do so really because of the fact that they deal with all aspects of addiction on a day-to-day basis.  However, the same cannot be said of the national agencies and Departments and their commitment to implement the strategy.<\/p><p>It has been like this for some time.  When the drugs strategy was established initially at a time before the crash in the economy and when the Taoiseach of the day took a more centre-stage role on the strategy, a clear instruction was given to all Departments and relevant agencies to participate fully.  That co-ordination of the strategy was taking place in the Taoiseach's office, which gave it muscle and a status it has lost in recent years.<\/p> <p> In 2011 I had a short period of having responsibility for the drugs strategy.  I was appointed first of all as Minister of State with responsibility for primary care.  It was some time later that I got a telephone call from a Minister saying they had forgotten about the drugs portfolio and asking if I would take it on as well.  It has become a bit of a pass-the-parcel.  Since the days when the national strategy team was based in the Department of the Taoiseach, it has lost much of its priority in political eyes.  We see that in how the different oversight bodies function.  This is in respect of the national steering committee and that co-ordinating body.  While it is not a new thing and not specifically the fault of the Minister of State, it is a fault of Government that insufficient priority has been given to this important area.<\/p> <p> With the steering committee, people come along to fill a seat without participating and without taking responsibility for the implementation of the strategy.  I have seen this at first hand and I know it has continued for a number of years.  Representatives from different Departments come along and give the impression it is a real drag for them to have to attend these meetings.  They sit there and generally do not contribute very much.  In the main the meetings are organised such that there are constant presentations on different things, which in turn lets everybody off the hook, rather than those meetings being challenging meetings where, for example, the Garda representatives are asked what they have done to respond to the issues raised at the previous meeting or officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are asked what they are doing to provide adequate training for people struggling with addiction problems.<\/p> <p> The Department of Education and Skills refused to provide a representative for a long period.  Officials from the Department of Education and Skills need to be asked what that Department is doing to solve that aspect of the problem because we know that a large number of drug users have a problem with education disadvantage.  The profile is there; we know what contributes to a high likelihood that somebody will get involved in substance misuse and addiction that can blight their lives.<\/p> <p> There is a huge issue there.  It is not just about the Department of Health.  It is all very well to say that it has to be a health-led response.  However, all these other agencies also have a responsibility and it seems they are not fulfilling that responsibility.  From reports I hear, I know how those two national bodies operate and they are not being challenged.<\/p> <p> Moreover, they are not participating in local drugs task forces either.  The Garda will send along a community garda instead of the inspector or superintendent attending and bringing along somebody from the drugs unit.  People from the Department of Education and Skills occasionally attend.  It took years for them to agree to participate.  I have long maintained that it is not just about them coming along to contribute to the drugs task force meeting; it is about the drugs task force discussions informing senior people from the Department of Education and Skills who need to be educated about the areas that have the biggest drug problems.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State has a responsibility to challenge these people and I do not think that is happening.  For example, there is a question about how these meetings are organised.  Is it about putting in the time, coming along, doing the two hours and sitting there silently?  That is what it seems to be and that is how it is viewed.  The Minister of State and the support people she has with her who have a responsibility for chairing those meetings need to ensure that those meetings are meaningful.<\/p> <p> Those attending should start off by hearing what is happening outside the walls of Departments, which in the main are rarefied areas.  The Minister of State needs to be hearing back from the drugs task forces as to what it is actually like in the real world.  That information coming back to her should inform the work of the national agencies and Departments.<\/p> <p> Those meetings need to be challenging for all of the attendees.  One way to do that is to put up the 50 actions that have been promised and to seek regular progress reports from the different agencies on what they are doing to implement them.  We all know how it is possible to put in two or three hours at a meeting that ends up being pretty meaningless unless people are challenged and expected to actually do things between those meetings.<\/p> <p> We heard much from the previous Minister of State about injecting rooms, which is a very small aspect of the drugs issue and it should not have been allowed to dominate.  It is no big deal but it seems to have been treated as a big deal.<\/p> <p> We are now talking about decriminalisation and have appointed an expert group, which is fine.  I believe that should happen but let us not fool ourselves into thinking that will somehow solve the drugs problem.  Some people have serious addiction problems that are destroying their lives.  They need to be responded to and that is the hard end of the thing.<\/p> <p> In addition, let us not fool ourselves that it is all about heroin.  Heroin treatment seems to be fixation of the Department of Health and the HSE.  That is why there has been such a poor response to the growing problem with cocaine and crack cocaine.  I have raised this several times and it is very hard to know if there are any services to address the growing cocaine problem.<\/p> <p> It is shocking that it is six and a half years since a memo was first brought to Cabinet about the alcohol Bill and we still have not seen it passed.  We have been promised it time and time again.  It was definitely supposed to have been through before this summer but that has not happened.<\/p> <p> All of these issues need urgent attention.  However, unless we start to tackle the causes of addiction in a meaningful way, we will not change the situation; we will continue to have a major problem that blights particular areas.  That is why the Government must be challenged to tackle the problem of economic, social and educational disadvantage, as well as the lack of housing which all feed into our shameful level of addiction.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State has one part to play and I have outlined that she should be challenging everybody and driving this strategy to make it a reality.  All of her ministerial colleagues have a responsibility in eradicating the causes of addiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800025#BB00500","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1530191700,"counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800026#CC00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1530191700,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss the lack of child psychiatry resources in the Limerick early intervention service; (2) Deputy James Lawless - to discuss the construction status of two post-primary schools on Maynooth campus; (3) Deputy Michael Harty - Brexit-proofing Waterways Ireland; (4) Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - to discuss the <i>per capita<\/i>rate of Government investment in Meath; (5) Deputies Sean Fleming and Brian Stanley - to discuss the electricity project at Coolnabacky, Ratheniska, County Laois; (6) Deputy Fergus O'Dowd - to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to address as a matter of urgency the serious intimidation of many families in County Louth by drug dealers; (7) Deputies Niamh Smyth, Pat Casey, Charlie McConalogue, Lisa Chambers and Declan Breathnach - to discuss changing the grass-cutting date on traditional hay meadows; (8) Deputy Carol Nolan - to urgently beseech the Minister for Justice and Equality to grant leave to remain on humanitarian grounds (details supplied); (9) Deputy Mary Butler - to discuss the enrolment difficulties in St. Declan's Community College, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford; (10) Deputy Gino Kenny - the issue of cyberbullying and bullying; (11) Deputy Tom Neville - to discuss the DEIS application for St. Mary's boys school, Abbeyfeale, County Limerick; (12) Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy - the need to provide the right to work for asylum seekers; (13) Deputies Frank O'Rourke and John Brassil - to discuss the housing assistance payment scheme in Kildare North and Kerry; (14) Deputy Louise O'Reilly - to discuss the implementation of action 2.1 of A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025; (15) Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin - to discuss the delays in granting home care packages; (16) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett - to discuss the funding crisis of the UNRWA in Palestine; (17) Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith - to discuss the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner; and (18) Deputy James Browne - to outline what action is being taken to prevent assaults on health workers.<\/p><p>The matters raised by Deputies Maurice Quinlivan, James Lawless and Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800026#CC00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Child Homelessness: Statements","time":1530192300,"counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800027#DD00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1530192300,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank the House for the opportunity to talk about this very important issue.  One of the very first conversations I had when I was appointed was with a person working in the educational space about the difficult situations the person was encountering with children who were in emergency accommodation in terms of their development, learning and growing.  From that very first induction into my job I was conscious of the need to place priority on the issue of children in emergency accommodation and making sure we were bringing in appropriate supports to help those children in all the needs a child will have in growing up, not only with regard to the crisis their family is experiencing at the time.<\/p>  <p>  We last had statements on this issue on 21 December last, the day before the Christmas break.  It is timely for us to debate it again and keep it on the agenda in order that we might keep coming back to the different measures we are introducing to make sure that they are both robust and bringing about solutions.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier today, I published the latest figures collected from local authorities and released by the Department.  The May figures show an increase of 57 adults, 12 families and 137 children and other dependants in emergency accommodation nationally over the past month.  However, these numbers do not present a single picture or upward trend for the entire country.  As we do more work and pull away more layers from the raw top-line numbers, we see that there was no increase in the number of adults accessing emergency accommodation outside of Dublin.  In Dublin, there was an increase of 57 adults accessing emergency accommodation.  This was a 1% increase on the figure for the previous month.  The number of families accessing emergency accommodation in Dublin fell by 13 and, significantly, presentations were also down, with 79 families presenting in May compared with 90 in April.  However, we again saw an increase in the figure for children and other dependants.  This was due to a small number of new families with a large number of children accessing emergency accommodation.  This is the second month in a row that this has happened.  It is deeply worrying because exit pathways for larger families can be more difficult to secure.  The figure for families outside of Dublin presenting seems to have stabilised, apart from an increase in the south-west region of 14.  The specific reasons for this need to be examined further.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, I recently published two reports in this area.  One was from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, which I had requested and which examined trends evident since the beginning of the year.  The other report was from the homeless inter-agency group I established after the first housing summit last September in order to ensure a more co-ordinated and effective response from the Departments and agencies involved in the delivery of services to the homeless.  I requested these two reports because I understand that the area is incredibly complex.  It presents us with challenges that cannot always be solved simply by providing accommodation or homes.  I sought recommendations and new solutions in order that we might continue to deliver on the progress being made under Rebuilding Ireland.  Solutions such as Housing First have helped us achieve a 40% reduction in the number of people sleeping rough and a 90% retention rate for people housed through Housing First.  A new national director was appointed earlier this year.  We are rolling out Housing First tenancies across the country and a national plan is being drafted and will come to me next month.  There are more solutions coming on foot of these reports.  Some have been explored with the housing committee.  This will continue at the third housing summit which is happening next Tuesday at the Custom House.<\/p>  <p>  I will look more specifically now at the situation facing children in homelessness.  As of May, we have 1,724 families, with 3,826 children and other dependants, in emergency accommodation.  We thought the figure was higher but work undertaken earlier in the year discovered that a number of families were not in emergency accommodation at all but were in homes with no risk of entering emergency accommodation and had incorrectly been counted as part of the monthly reports.  Work continues to identify further families and individuals who may have been inappropriately included in these numbers.  It is important that we do this work for accuracy but our focus must always be on individuals and the supports they need.  Of the approximately 1,700 families recorded as being in emergency accommodation, less than half are in hotels.  This is still a sizeable number and, as we all agree, one family in a hotel is one too many.  Finding solutions for these families in particular is a top priority for me and my Department.  In 2017, more than 2,000 families left hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and the majority went into homes.  We know there are solutions that work; we just need to drive them harder.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published reports tell us some distressing things, such as the fact that 65% of families in emergency accommodation in Dublin are headed by lone parents and one in five of these families is headed by a parent under the age of 24.  They also tell us that a significant number of families have refused the housing assistance payment, HAP, instead choosing to go into or stay in emergency accommodation.  Whatever preconceptions people may have about HAP or the private rental market, a home is far superior to a hotel or hub.  We have to work to support these families into the rental sector where it is the most immediate practical response to their housing needs.  If that means reforming HAP in some way, then we will do that.  HAP is working for tens of thousands of people, just as the rental market, despite rent inflation, which is slowing down dramatically, is working for hundreds of thousands of people.  Deputies in the House should take care that neither their words nor their actions put people off HAP and see them entering into hotels or bed and breakfasts instead.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department made the HAP place finder service available to all local authorities.  This provides that the local authority can pay a rental deposit and up to two months&rsquo; rent for individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness.  It also provides that my Department will fund 90% of the cost of a dedicated place finder officer to work with families to source suitable properties.  Funding for a place finder officer has been approved in 17 local authorities that have requested this support.  We also have seen that a significant number of families have refused a permanent social housing home in their area of choice and have remained in a hotel, hub or bed and breakfast.  The reasons for this require further examination.  It is very difficult for the general public to understand why this may be the case.<\/p>  <p>  The reports also tells us a number of positive things, like the fact that the rate of increase of families accessing emergency accommodation slowed in 2017 in comparison with previous years.  We saw dramatic increases in 2015 and 2016.  This has slowed quite dramatically, particularly in Dublin.  The trend in Dublin appears to be one of stabilisation with another fall in families accessing emergency accommodation in May and a decrease in presentations.  This trend may be developing outside of Dublin too, with the exception of one outlier region that recorded a significant increase of 14 new families accessing emergency accommodation in the May report.<\/p>  <p>  Families who presented to homeless services in 2016 spent an average of ten months in emergency accommodation before departing to a tenancy.  In 2017, this time was reduced with families who presented to homeless services spending an average of four months in emergency accommodation before departing to a tenancy.  In a one-year period that is significant progress for the families experiencing this crisis in their lives through no fault of their own.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the report also highlights that families staying in hubs typically exit emergency accommodation into an independent tenancy within a shorter timeframe than families staying in hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation.  This highlights the need for the delivery of additional family hub spaces.  Over 530 families are accommodated in hubs and we expect to introduce an additional 400 such spaces for family accommodation in the next six to eight months which will help us to reduce our reliance on hotels for emergency accommodation.  We never wanted to have to accommodate families in hotels and bed and breakfasts but we obviously could not allow families to sleep rough on our streets.  As the crisis worsened, more families were accommodated in this way.  No family need ever sleep rough because we have contingency rooms in place every night of the week.  No family has to spend the night in a Garda station because we have contingency rooms in place every night of the week and we are developing more.<\/p>  <p>  The reason the family hub is the more appropriate first response - I stress it is only a first response - is because it allows us to wrap all of the support services that are needed around the family in their time of crisis.  As soon as the family go into the hub they are immediately met by a support team whose main aim is to exit them from homelessness.  Supporting an exit from homelessness sometimes requires more than a house.  Sometimes it requires broader social and welfare supports.  Family hubs allow for a much more co-ordinated needs assessment and support planning for the family.  Supports include appropriate play space, cooking and laundry facilities and communal recreation space while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Supports also include on-site access to welfare, health, housing services and other appropriate supports and free childcare for children.  A special emphasis is placed on children from homeless families through the school completion programme.  Schools with home-school community liaison co-ordinators are proactively engaging with parents from homeless families to assist access to any other supports that may be of assistance.  Children in homeless accommodation are also being prioritised within the school completion programme for services such as breakfast and homework clubs.  Leap cards are available to assist families in accessing transport links, thus minimising the risk of missing school days.  This is much more stable and suitable than a hotel and the statistics tell us it is working.  It is critical that best practice regarding child protection, child welfare and child development is at the forefront of our mind in every facility where there are children present.  I speak on a regular basis with my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to ensure that robust child protection measures, inspection arrangements and health supports are in place in emergency accommodation for families.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has a strong commitment to the protection of families and children experiencing homelessness and I want to acknowledge that in the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  I have also met the Ombudsman for Children and the commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to discuss issues on homeless families.  I have assured the Ombudsman we are doing everything possible to ensure the needs of children are foremost in the policies we implement and the services we deliver.  I have visited many of the family hubs and met the service providers and many of the families and children staying in the hubs.  The feedback from the families has been positive.  While I would rather not have any families in emergency accommodation, the hubs certainly offer a significantly better and more child-friendly approach for short-term emergency accommodation than hotels and bed and breakfasts.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has an inspection regime in place for the family hubs to deal with complaints and to ensure targets are met and that accommodation is appropriate and safe.  The inspection team has a work programme, which includes site visits and interaction with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation.  Separate to the existing inspection regime, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive has been overseeing the development of a quality standards framework with a view to having the finalised standards introduced on a national basis by all local authorities.<\/p><p>I understand that the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive will formally submit the framework to me shortly for approval.  I look forward to receiving its submission and working with local authorities to further enhance and strengthen the arrangements in place across the country.<\/p> <p> Finally, I pay tribute to all of the work being undertaken by the local authorities and the NGO service providers in this area.  All these individuals face a difficult job and work tirelessly to provide supports to the individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness.  Supporting these efforts is a priority for my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800027#DD00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530192900,"counter":255,"content":"<p>This is like groundhog day.  During my previous contribution on homelessness in our republic in March, I concluded by pleading to Government to declare homelessness to be a national emergency.  Our homelessness national emergency needs a whole-of-government response with daily targets and reports, rather than quarterly.  I ask Government to do this now and to declare that the common good of our nation dictates that Government ensures a minimum standard of housing for all of our people.<\/p>  <p>  If policies are not working then they need to be changed or dumped immediately.  There are nearly 10,000 homeless human beings in Ireland today who need to hear a better response.  I wish I could state that, today, there is a better reality to report but the fact remains that there are 3,826 children homeless today in this so-called \"republic of opportunity\".  That figure does not take in the hidden homeless children in \"Leo&rsquo;s Ireland\" and I commend Barnardos for their excellent research in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Last December, during yet another debate on child homelessness, I had to report the sad reality of families being accommodated in my own hotel in Glendalough.  These stressed families have young children who were being transported more than 50 km each day to get to school and struggle for some appearance of normal life.  I wish I could state that, today, this disgraceful child homelessness has ended, but the fact remains that homeless Dublin families are still being forced to seek accommodation in my hotel in Glendalough, and beyond.  What does it say about the crisis in child homelessness that we are putting tourists into homes in Dublin today while Irish families are crammed into hotel rooms throughout the commuter belt?<\/p>  <p>  In one of my first contributions to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government two years ago, I was the first to raise the point that short-term letting platforms such as Airbnb were being abused in Dublin and that homes that could be used for our homeless families were being used to accommodate tourists.  I warned about this and, at the time, I was accused of scaremongering and attacking Airbnb by vested interests.  Two years later, Irish families are being transported to a hotel in Glendalough to escape homelessness while houses and apartments are being rented to tourists.  If this fact does not make everyone in this House ashamed and disgusted, let me warn them what is going to happen when Pope Francis visits.  Dublin city hotels and all accommodation providers will be jam-packed with attending delegates.  Where will homeless families go?  It would be sickening, wrong and a national disgrace if we were to ship these families away from the eyes of the media into faraway hotels.  They should be given the platform that the World Meeting of Families provides to address child and family homelessness, not only in Ireland but globally.<\/p>  <p>  There are warnings around the world about how cold governments can be about families that are homeless and looking for shelter.  It is a little rich to lecture the United States about the horrific treatment of homeless immigrant families in Texas when, for years, the Government has failed to tackle child and family homelessness in Ireland.  Fianna F&aacute;iI has tried time and again to urge the Government parties to act radically on child and family homelessness.  Fianna F&aacute;il has given them every opportunity to give the crisis the attention it deserves.  The trauma suffered by Irish children because of their experience of homelessness in Ireland will mirror the trauma of children and families around the world.  Governmental systems throughout the world pay too much lip service to caring about families experiencing homelessness, and do not take enough action.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is currently part of the problem in tackling child and family homelessness.  A national emergency should be declared now, before Ireland joins an international list of shameful responses to those in need of shelter, help, and a place to call home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800028#EE00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1530192900,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I am Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on children and youth affairs.  I do not have the briefings or the knowledge the Minister has about all the reports, other than what I listen to and what I read in the newspapers.  I can, however, speak about the reality of what I am experiencing on the ground and what I hear from parents and families who are trying to live a normal life.  They are going through an entire generation without having a place they can call home.<\/p>  <p>  I debated this with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coveney, prior to Christmas 2016 and brought up the issue of children who do not have a back garden and who cannot bring other children home to play.  In a normal day, children have play dates and hold birthday parties, celebrate other events, put up a Christmas tree or hang cards but many of the 3,826 homeless children do not experience this.  The do not have the same opportunities as other children.  They do not have a front door or a house they can draw on their colouring book at school, like we all did when we were young.<\/p>  <p>  I never play politics with this issue and I do not criticise, but it is wrong.  It is not solely the responsibility of the Minister and a whole-of-government approach is needed.  Education has an important part to play in this, particularly the early years sector.  When local authority development officers and liaison officers go out, they do not knock on the front doors of school principals to ask if there is enough room for children in the schools.  They do not tell principals they are acquiring houses and they are looking forward to integrating children, and they do not ask if the necessary SNAs are in place.  I know of a case where an approved housing body secured 11 houses but it did not engage with the secondary school or the national school about SNAs.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to mention how long it takes county councils to turn houses around.  Galway County Council purchased ten houses in Portumna more than six months ago and it still have not managed to get people in the front door.  Such delays are preventing children from having a normal childhood.  The ten houses to which I refer should be occupied at this moment and children should be having the family experiences they need to have.<\/p>  <p>  When families go before the housing liaison officer, they do not get the support they need in respect of education and health.  They are tiring and wilting and they need help and support.  They need to feel a little bit more valued than just being a number on a sheet of paper.  Children need to feel that when their mother or father presents at a local authority office, they are valued.  We had a children's referendum but their voices are not being heard and it is a shame that parents feel their child does not have a value.  Parents do everything for their children but 3,826 children are homeless.  The hubs are a significant improvement on keeping children in hotel rooms but they are not the solution.  It is also unfortunate we have not moved away from using hotel rooms.<\/p>  <p>  My final point is about student accommodation.  Last year, 22 students slept homeless at the beginning of their year on Eyre Square in Galway because they could not find accommodation.<\/p><p>Student accommodation needs to be a priority and we need to look at how we can support these young adults.  They do not want to put the burden on their parents when they cannot find digs or suitable accommodation.  We need to have people within the city council and the county council who can assist those to whom I refer.  People in third-level education should not have to sleep rough because they do not want to put pressure on their parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800028#EE00400","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530193500,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for ensuring that the homelessness figures were published today.  It will make the debate more informed and up-to-date.  My first thought on reading the figures in the last 20 minutes is that I am ashamed to be a Member of this 32nd D&aacute;il.  That is because we are presiding over the single most dramatic increase in child homelessness on record.  If the Opposition feels ashamed - and I do not say that in any glib way - then surely the Minister should also feel shame at being part of a Government that is presiding over this level of increase.<\/p>  <p>  There are 9, 846 people who are homeless, including 3,820 children.  That is an increase of 137 children on the previous month and a 27% increase on the same time last year.  More than any other set of figures, these speak volumes.  I am not surprised.  Like all politicians on the Government and Opposition benches, I spend almost all of my clinic time dealing with families that are now at risk of losing, are losing or have lost their homes.  I notice that the profile of those families is beginning to change.  It is not getting any better - it is getting worse.  An increasing number of working families that are not even eligible for social housing are coming in with notices to quit, are unable to find alternative private rental and are seeking assistance.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on some numbers and then talk about the faces behind them.  Since the Minister and the Taoiseach have been in office, adult homelessness is up 24% and child homelessness is up 60%.  Since Fine Gael returned to office in 2016, homelessness is up 32% and child homelessness is up 80%.  I repeat, as I always do, that these figures do not include those adults and children in hostels in Dublin city - approximately 100 of them that are not funded by the Department - and it does not include the 2,500 children who go through Tusla-funded domestic violence emergency step-down accommodation in a given year.  It also does not include the 500 or so adults and children who have leave to remain and who are trapped in direct provision and using that as emergency accommodation or the 857 adults and children recategorised in the previous two months.  How is it possible that the Minister can even mention the word \"progress\" when that is scale of the increase.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister about one thing, namely, that behind these figures are real people.  I refer to the single mum in inappropriate emergency accommodation - no matter what kind - who is far away from school and family supports, the pensioner who does not know if he or she has night to night accommodation or if he or she will have a roof over his or her head tomorrow or the rough sleeper.  There are rough sleepers and that is because some emergency accommodation is not acceptable, safe or appropriate.  Some people have no other alternative other than to sleep rough.  That is not to criticise the enormous good work done by the vast majority of emergency accommodation providers, it is a reflection of fact.<\/p>  <p>  This all tells us that Rebuilding Ireland is not working.  It is failing not just these 10,000 adults and children but many tens of thousands more.  The rate of social housing delivery continues to be glacial despite the fact that we have continually recommended reducing the 18-month approval process to six months in order to facilitate quicker delivery.  Rapid build is the most misnamed housing development project in the history of the State because it takes almost as long as standard housing.  The Housing First targets are far too low.  We need 2,000 to 3,000 Housing First units over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland to get long-term entrenched homeless singles out of emergency accommodation and not the 300 envisaged in the plan, albeit that those are welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Action on vacant homes - particularly private vacant homes - is still too slow.  The Minister has still not answered why, out of 1,800 vacant turnkey homes offered to the Housing Agency, only some 350 have been purchased.  Action to prevent homelessness is mixed.  There are some good initiatives - there is no doubt about that.  The tenancy sustainment service from Focus Ireland is a case in point.  If the Focus Ireland amendment to the Residential Tenancies Bill had been passed when we, along with others, tabled it in 2016, that would have kept hundreds, if not thousands, of families out of emergency accommodation.  The Minister has a damn cheek to suggest that our criticisms of HAP is why people are nervous about it.  There are good things about HAP but the fact that recipients are removed from the primary housing list acts as a disincentive.  Fix it and leave those people on the primary housing list to meet their long-term social housing need.  The Minister should be ashamed that he is failing these real people, these real adults and children, and he has to accept that his plan is not working and start listening to the alternatives being proposed by the Opposition.  If he does not, we will be back here next month having exactly the same debate and that is not why I was elected to this D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800029#FF00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1530193500,"counter":259,"content":"<p>There are 3,826 children homeless in this country.  Between April 2017 and April of this year, the numbers of children homelessness increased by about 50%.  That is the single biggest increase in child homelessness on record in the State.  As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, stated, these figures are an underestimate of the true numbers of children living in homelessness as they do not include children living in temporary living arrangements with families or children living with women in domestic violence refuges.  The trajectories of these children lives have been changed by this experience.  There is no doubt that the outcomes of these children's lives have been negatively altered, possibly, and most likely, for the rest of their lives.<\/p>  <p>  Temporary accommodation arrangements are hugely detrimental to children short-term and long-term.  Logically, there are social effects.  For example, children have no place to call home, to bring friends back to, etc.  It affects them physically as well.  The food children eat is prepared within the home.  Only a narrow range of food can be prepared in most temporary homes.  It also affects their mental health because the stresses and the strains these children go through daily, because they have no home, is incredible.  We saw a case, documented by Ombudsman for Children, where a woman and her two children, having left an abusive home, were waiting for two years before they were housed.  The most vulnerable in society are being penalised again.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's party has been in Government for seven long years now.  There are no excuses for the figures we are seeing, yet week after week, month after month, what we see is the Minister and the Taoiseach coming in here and uttering mealy-mouthed excuses in respect of what is happening with these reduced outcomes.  Let us be clear - every Deputy here is directly and individually responsible for the actions taken.  The Minister is responsible for all of those individual children who are homeless now and for the reduced outcomes of their lives.  That is because the excuses the Minister makes weekly and monthly are not excuses of lack of ability, mistakes, mismanagement or uselessness, for want of a better word.  The excuses he has given are designed to muddy the water and hide the fact that these children are homeless as a result of the policy decisions that have been made.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael tolerates these figures and they happen because of the policy decisions that the Government makes year after year.  It is interesting that, for the past number of years, we have been having a row about the use of funds.  The use of investments and taxpayer's money is important in how a country is designed.  In the past three years, however, this Government has given more than &euro;1.5 billion back to mostly upper-income earners in this country.  That is a massive message about the priorities of this Government.  In his end-of-year speech, the Minister said that this is the main priority of the Government.  That is nonsense.  If it were the main priority, then the Government would not be allergic to social housing Bills, as it has been over the last number of years.  It would not have been inert on the proper controls and regulations of rent over the last number of years.  The Government would have been properly involved in the development of housing.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at even the private housing sector.  Fine Gael is meant to be the party of the free market.<\/p><p>The private housing sector is the most distorted sector in the economy.  The distortions which exist in that sector could not be designed.  It is broken, partly due to the fact that the Government has a deference towards vulture funds and that tax breaks are given to foreign landlords<i>en masse <\/i>.  The Minister could do many things to change this, but it breaks my heart to see the Government come into this House, month after month, and make excuses for the way things are.  Let us call a spade a spade.  We should be honest.  The ideological position of Fine Gael and its policy decisions in recent years have resulted in these cruel figures.  This has not happened by accident.  I plead with the Government to take a different tack at this stage.  It should pay heed to policies put forward by the Opposition and put them into action so that we see a dramatic reduction in these figures within the next 18 months to two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800029#FF00300","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530194100,"counter":261,"content":"<p>The homelessness figures for May, which have just been released by the Minister, are truly shocking.  They show an increase in the number of adults, families and children without a home since last month.  The figures show that there are almost 10,000 people homeless when the numbers of adults and dependants are added together.  The most shocking aspect of this is that there are 137 newly homeless children included in the figures for last month.  This demands action.  The number of homeless children has increased, from 3,689 to 3,826, in the past month.<\/p>  <p>  Today and tomorrow, primary school children will be getting their summer holidays.  They will wave goodbye to their teachers and classrooms and will go home.  They are looking forward to a summer of fun in their neighbourhoods and possibly a week or two in a holiday resort.  However, those 3,826 children in homeless services face a very different prospect.  They do not have permanent homes or neighbouring children to play with.  They are probably sharing one or two rooms in a hotel with the rest of their family, with no space to play, to go outside and kick a ball, ride a bike or scoot on a scooter, as our children and grandchildren do during the holidays.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe we should leave the D&aacute;il this summer until we have put a programme of support in place for families availing of homeless services for the period of the school holidays.  I noted that the Minister spoke about the school completion programme, homework clubs, after-school clubs and transport to school, among other things.  However, these children are going home from school for their holidays and they really need a programme of support.  I ask that the Minister liaise with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, in order to put a programme of support in place.  This may mean organising trips to parks or that the children be enrolled in summer programmes, but those families really need extra help.  They cannot afford holidays.  They cannot even cook their own food; all of it has to be bought in.  A range of supports must be put in place before the recess.<\/p>  <p>  We must put a limit on the amount of time a child can live in a hotel or a bed and breakfast.  We all know that Rebuilding Ireland promised to end the use of hotels, except for short-term use.  I accept that it may be a short-term solution, but the promise was made.  Rebuilding Ireland was published two years ago but that promise has still not been fulfilled.  At my clinic the week before last, I met two families that had been in hotels for a year or more.  We have to set a time limit.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has pointed out how the number of children who are homeless has increased since the Government took office.  From April 2017 to April 2018, the number of homeless children increased by 36%.  We cannot talk this away.  It needs focus, action, a plan and a time limit.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister looks quite deflated today.  His intentions are good, but we really need more of a focus and more urgency.  Time limits have to be put in place.  Many Members of the Opposition have suggested that there should be a statutory right to housing or a referendum on the issue.  That would focus minds within the housing authorities, which would have to deliver then.  I know a little bit about the Scottish situation, but not much about the other 81 countries where people have a constitutional or statutory right to housing.  My understanding is that this would ensure that the kind of urgent focus we need is applied to this issue, and it should be looked at as a potential solution.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will meet the CEOs of the local authorities at a summit next week.  He should say a number of very specific things to them.  The Minister indicated that he supports them in doing what they are supposed to do, but he should take out the stick a little bit more and tell them what they have to do.  We have all spoken about the number of vacant homes, both private and public.  The void scheme has ensured that publicly-owned local authority houses have mostly been brought back into use.  However, the number of privately-owned vacant homes is still very large.  The vacant homes officers who have been appointed should be told to focus solely on bringing vacant houses back into use.  They should not have any other duties.  Such an approach has been effective in Britain.  The Peter McVerry Trust has also used it successfully in Ireland.  The situation is absolutely urgent, and this is perhaps the quickest fix possible.  The Minister must also impress upon the CEOs that they have to prioritise families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and get them into homes.  Recently, I spoke to a Labour Party councillor who said that the CEOs must consult councillors when the disposal of publicly-owned land is proposed.  The Minister does not have to be notified when that is done.  I suggest that he should have to be informed if any CEO proposes the disposal of lands which could be used for social and affordable housing.  He should also go back to the drawing board and ask every local authority to come up with a plan for every vacant site that is appropriate for housing.  That process is taking far too long and it is also not achieving the correct mix of housing.  Those of us on the Opposition benches would like to see these sites used exclusively for social and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about the families that are now homeless.  I urge that the Bill I introduced in July of last year - the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017 - be progressed.  It passed Second Stage with support from everyone in the House, for which I am thankful.  However, it still has not progressed to Committee Stage.  The support of the Government is required to move it on.  The Bill will ensure that local authorities and housing authorities have to respond to the rights of the child.  In addition, it would impose a legal obligation on the local authorities to act in the best interests of the child when his or her family becomes homeless.  I want to see progress on that Bill.  I also want to ensure that there is an immediate focus on those families with children who are saying goodbye to school this week.  Post-primary students have already finished school for the summer.  The fact that so many families will live in hotel rooms for the summer is intolerable.  The needs of such families have to be prioritised immediately.  They should be given the kind of supports they need to have some kind of normal summer, and also in terms of prioritising them for the housing that is in place, whether vacant homes, local authority homes or private homes.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to raise the issue of prevention.  I acknowledge that some measures have been taken to prevent homelessness, including HAP among other schemes.  In Britain, there is an obligation to intervene much earlier.  A similar approach has been proposed in housing debates in this House on previous occasions.  As soon as a local authority becomes aware that a family will potentially become homeless, it should intervene at that point rather than waiting until the family actually is homeless.  Much more can be done to keep families in their homes, particularly if they are in private rented accommodation, to prevent them from becoming homeless.  That solution is much better, particularly for children in those families.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking again today.  We have spoken about the housing crisis many times in this Chamber.  It is an emergency, but I really believe that specific actions must emerge from this debate today.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are present.  I hope they will take on board the various proposals coming from this side of the House, for both the short term and the long term, in order to ensure to ensure that we get rid of this blight on our community and this distortion of childhoods of so many young people.<\/p><p>I note the figure today is 3,826 and we must ensure that we are not looking at an even higher number in respect of the June figures.  The Minister should give us a programme of action after this debate and should use the summit with the chief executive officers, CEOs, of the housing authorities next week as they have a very important role here as well.  Housing is not always prioritised by CEOs of local authorities but it needs to be the absolute priority and that should be the message the Minister gives to them when he meets them next week.  I hope we see a decrease in the figures next month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800030#GG00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530194700,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The misery, suffering, hardship and cruelty that are being imposed on thousands of children, the 144,000 people on housing waiting lists and the 10,000 people who are homeless are simply intolerable and the position is getting worse and worse.  The more we talk, the worse it gets.  It is the bitter fruit of the disastrous decision the Minister's party took in 2011 - alongside the Labour Party it has to be said - to stop building council housing and to outsource it to the private sector.  It is also a consequence of the failure for years to admit there was a crisis and the Minister's continuing failure to do what is necessary.  I am sick of it.<\/p>  <p>  Two weeks ago, I read an email from a woman with three children to the Minister.  I will tell her story again, because there is a postscript to it now.  She originally wrote to me that due to the housing assistance payment, HAP, rules, she was not able to rent a house in Enniskerry, as she could only get a payment of &euro;1,500 for Wicklow.  She told me that the following Friday, her family would move into a hotel in Bray, which would cost the public &euro;4,390 a month.  She asked if it would not be easier and cheaper to let her have the Dublin rate.  She told me she would email Deputy Eoghan Murphy and her local Deputy, Deputy Simon Harris, as a matter of urgency.  It had taken her three months to find a house in Enniskerry.  She wrote there was nothing in north Wicklow for less than &euro;2,000 and Dublin was even higher.  She was angry, upset and scared.  Her daughter was totally distraught as she had been all set to move into the new place.<\/p>  <p>  This woman had found a place.  An official named Mary, who works with the Minister, contacted the HAP office.  Officials there said they were sorry but there was nothing they could do.  In Enniskerry, about 200 m away from where that house is, one can get the Dublin limit.  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Bray border cuts through that gap.  In the case of houses that literally are a stone's throw from each other, an applicant can get &euro;1,950 from HAP for one but only &euro;1,440 for the other.  The property costs &euro;1,950, which is the Dublin limit.  As a result, this woman is now in a hotel, costing us &euro;4,300.<\/p>  <p>  This woman wrote to me again to touch base.  She wrote that the day had been tough.  It had been the first day that she had really felt wobbly.  She wrote she could feel the darkness coming.  Her mental health is a huge issue and trying to keep everything together was starting to take its toll.  She had made an appointment to see her GP the following day.  At that point, it had only been five days since her family moved into the hotel.  She wrote that she did not know what triggered it but that morning, she woke up and just knew that things had shifted.  She wrote she was scared for herself and her children.  Her eldest had a summer job and her middle child was in the room as she wrote, trying to block it all out.  Her daughter had been at school but would finish the following day.  She added a few things it is better not even to mention but they are not good things.  She told me she was sorry to tell me about all of this and said she had been down the dark road of suicide before.  She was scared that this would go on and on.  She did not know how she or her children would cope.  This is what is going on and I am just absolutely sick of it, as are the people who are suffering in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  I have to hand some pictures of emergency accommodation in Stillorgan.  One shows cockroaches crawling through the place.  Another shows a dead rat.  Another picture shows food that must be kept in plastic bags to prevent it from being affected by the rampant mould in the place.  I also have correspondence from people who are in Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, accommodation in Clonskeagh with their children.  The children do not have a proper place to play.  Another resident - they are not blaming the resident but the children probably should not have been in the company of that resident - gave the children a BB gun.  Young children were running around with a BB gun, which is a very dangerous weapon for a young child.  There are complaints.  I believe they have written to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, about the way this was handled.  The literature describing this emergency accommodation states children's safety will be the absolute priority and that there are protocols for dealing with all this kind of stuff.  None of that has been followed.  The residents are thinking of taking legal action over the State's negligence in ensuring the welfare of their children. <\/p>  <p>  The stories multiply.  I get calls every week from the hub in D&uacute;n Laoghaire about the difficulties people are facing in there.  They are told to avail of the HAP.  They are told there is a thing called a place finder service.  This is an absolute joke.  There is no place finder service because there are no places to find within the HAP limits.  They do not exist.  The people who work in the council know they do not exist and that is why they do not really provide a place finder service.  The places are not there.  If people are lucky enough to find a place, it is over the limit and then they cannot get the uplift to the place.  Such people are stuck in the hub, the hotel or the emergency accommodation in these kinds of conditions with their mental health breaking down, terrified for the welfare of their children.  It just goes on and on.<\/p>  <p>  What really drives me around the twist is that side by side with such examples, in my area perfectly good apartments are sitting empty on D&uacute;n Laoghaire's main street.  These are just the ones I know about.  I have mentioned them three times in here.  They are in the hands of Apollo Global Management, a vulture fund which bought them from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  It is sitting on eight or nine perfectly good properties that sit there empty; properties in which these families could be living.  <\/p>  <p>  I refer also to the Robin Hill apartments in Balally, where 25 apartments that were sold by NAMA are sitting there.  NAMA refused to give them to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council when it asked to buy them.  They are still sitting there empty six or seven years later.  Nothing has been done about it.  Cerberus Capital Management, the vulture fund that owns them now, is watching the value of that property clock ever upwards.  Cerberus will walk away without paying any tax because the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, introduced tax breaks to invite in these people to speculate on Irish property.  They will pay nothing on the rental income on the ones they do rent and they will walk away without paying a cent in capital gains tax on the ones sitting there empty.<\/p>  <p>  That is what is going on.  The misery of these families and children is the flip side of the coin of the extortionate, greed-driven profiteering of vulture funds and landlords that the Minister's policies have facilitated and continue to facilitate.  I ask him, where is the place finder service that will knock on the door of Apollo and demand that those apartments are made available to the people who are suffering in the hubs?  Where is that place finder service? <\/p>  <p>  If one goes down to the offices of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, one does not see a sign saying \"Place finder service\".  I am sure it is the same everywhere else.  There is no place where it is sitting there and one can go in.  That is what there should be.  There should be a big sign saying \"Place finders: we are the people who help you find a place\".  They should be sitting there in the morning and people should be able to know that they will be there from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  People should know there are people working for the council whose job is solely to look for those places and who have the power to take them and give them to the people who are homeless.  Anything less is just nonsense at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is the fact that public land is being sat on.  It is reported that 114,000 dwellings could be built on the lands that the local authorities and NAMA have.  What is happening on these sites?  For the most part, absolutely nothing.  That does not even take in to account semi-State bodies like CI&Eacute;, which sells sites to Mr. Johnny Ronan down on Spencer Dock<\/p><p>That is what they have done in London.  The transport authority in London is using its property to provide affordable housing.  What does CI&Eacute; do?  It is allowed by the Government to sell it to Johnny Ronan, who then goes into NAMA, buys his way out of NAMA eventually with the support of - guess who - the vulture funds, and is now back in business building properties on Spencer Dock that nobody will be able to afford.  The value of the property is clocking ever upwards but the misery of the people living in homeless accommodation or waiting 15 or 20 years on housing lists goes on and on.  When are we going to do something about this?  It requires radical action.  It requires doing things that so far the Government has refused to do, namely, get those properties.  It must pass whatever emergency legislation is necessary to get those empty properties and commence immediately building public housing on the land we have.  Otherwise, this human misery will just get worse and worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800031#HH00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530195300,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I echo the comments of my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Three years ago, I met the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, and highlighted my concern at the time at the inappropriate accommodating of homeless children in hotel rooms and bed and breakfasts and at the lack of action by the Government in tackling the crisis.  At that time, I also met the Children's Rights Alliance regarding the inclusion of children experiencing homelessness in its report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  That summer, during the week of 24 to 30 August 2015, there were a shocking 707 homeless families and 1,496 homeless children but by the week of 21 to 27 May 2018, in the most recent figures made available, those numbers had jumped dramatically to 1,724 homeless families with 3,826 homeless children.<\/p>  <p>  Shame on Fine Gael, shame on Fianna F&aacute;il and shame on the private landlords for commodifying housing and pushing such huge numbers of families and children into homelessness.  We know that rising and unaffordable rents are one of the main causal factors of family homelessness and yet nothing real has been done to address this.  The previous Government spoke about measures such as rent caps but as the Minister well knows, we are still seeing inexorable rises.  The strategy of Rebuilding Ireland is to push more and more families into the private rental sector through the housing assistance payment, HAP, programme, which is not stable, does not provide security of tenure and is not value for money.  The Minister might have heard me speak some time ago to the T&aacute;naiste about families who are being evicted from HAP tenancies.  The cost-benefit analysis of investing in housing stock or lining the pockets of private landlords would clearly show where the longer-term financial gain would be, not to mention the main benefit of providing greater security for families and their children.<\/p>  <p>  Focus Ireland&rsquo;s report, Finding a Home: Families' Journeys out of Homelessness, by Dr. Kathy Walsh and Brian Harvey, which was published last November, showed that the negative impacts of homelessness abated more quickly for those families who were rehoused in local authority accommodation or with an approved housing body compared with those placed in HAP accommodation, for the simple reason of uncertainly and the feeling children have.  I am sure the Minister has met them himself.  They experience great fear about the fact they do not have a forever home like most children..  It is interesting to note that the report found that the speed of adjustment did not appear to be linked to the duration of homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, Barnardos produced a briefing paper, Faces Behind the Figures of Child Homelessness, which stated these children are being robbed of their childhoods and this will have lifelong implications for them and for all of society.  In the years to come, perhaps in the not too distant future, Ministers will be held accountable and even people who served in the previous Government and the Government before that will be held accountable for this.  We have had apologies recently for horrendous deeds done to citizens in the dark chapters the Taoiseach has spoken about.  Here we are, living in a dark chapter, and the Minister and his colleagues have the power to bring it to an end with Fianna F&aacute;il, in the joint Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Government, but they are absolutely refusing to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Hidden homelessness is often mentioned in the national discourse but it is not recorded.  Week in, week out Deputies meet some of the huge number of families with children who are living in cramped and overcrowded accommodation, sharing with family members or friends and couch-surfing, which, unfortunately, we have all had to get used to in recent times.  We have had the report from Leilani Farha, the special rapporteur for adequate housing with the United Nations, which supported calls for a right to housing to be included in the Constitution.  That could be done on 26 October if the Minister wanted to do so.  A right to housing could be put into the Constitution.  Several Bills have been introduced by colleagues in the House asking precisely for this to happen.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, we spoke a lot about Europe, as we will do in the coming days.  Given it is a European-wide problem, to what extent has the Minister sought support from the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived?  I know the Minister and the Government have done some work in this regard but have they really exploited the possibilities of getting serious funding for our local authorities to rebuild their stock and give them a housing arm?<\/p>  <p>  I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tireless work of the volunteers behind the #MyNameIs campaign, including Mick Caul, Erica Fleming and others; Anthony Flynn and the team in Inner City Helping Homeless, ICHH; the agencies working with, and advocating for, homeless children and families; the volunteers behind the North Dublin Bay Housing Crisis Committee, who work very hard to have fun days out at Christmas and Easter, and all the teachers who support homeless children in their classrooms and bring understanding to their awful living conditions of these children.  The Minister has an historic task here and he is flunking it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800032#JJ00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1530195300,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Every single one of us here should be ashamed of the horrendous human misery, not only for the homeless but also for the number of people on housing waiting lists and of our failure to deal with the issue.  So much for our republic of opportunity.  It is opportunity for some and misery for others.<\/p>  <p>  Five years ago, we had a referendum on children's rights.  In many areas, all that means is the right of children to queue for services that do not exist.  It certainly is the case for the 3,826 children who are homeless.  The commitment by the Government that no family would be in a hotel or bed and breakfast by 1 July last year has been a failure.  By the Government's own standards it has been failure.  How ironic that statements are now coming from hotels that they will have to move out homeless families when the Pope comes over.  No room at the inn in our so-called republic.<\/p>  <p>  According to the ISPCC, one in three homeless people are children.  There has been a 287% rise in child homelessness in the past three years, which is the worst record in Europe.  To find a solution it is necessary to examine how this situation came about.  It is not difficult to trace the origins of the housing and homeless crisis.  For the past 30 years, there has been a concerted policy shift from council housing directly built by local authorities to a policy of rent supports in the private sector.  This was accelerated by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government from 2011 on.  The effect is dramatic if one looks at the figures.  In 1975, local authorities built 8,794 council social housing units.  That equated to one third of the total build.  In 2005, 5,559 local authority units were built, just 6% of the total build.  In 2015, 75 local authority units were built.  In 1961, 18.4% of housing was council stock but in 2011 it was 8.7%, which is a 50% reduction.  This is because of housing policy.<\/p>  <p>  This policy shift was exacerbated by the austerity cuts to local authorities, with cuts of up to 25% to staff and funding.  For example, if the 2009 level of local authority building had been maintained we would have 31,000 extra units now, which could have made a significant impact on the crisis.  Another example of the effect of this policy shift is shown by the growth in housing waiting lists.  In 1996, 28,000 were on our national list, the figure in 2016 was 91,600, and it is now well over 100,000.  A total of 20% of those on the list have been on it for seven years and 50% have been on it for more than five years.  We also have the hidden homeless who have been mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  Rent support was introduced in the 1970s as a temporary income support.  It was not introduced as a housing policy and it is really important to make this clear.  That changed with the introduction of the rental accommodation scheme in 2009 and the HAP in 2011.  This is a policy of subsidising the private rental sector to the tune of &euro;500 million a year in an attempt to create a new landlord class.  The attempt to create a broad-based Irish landlord class has failed, as shown in the number of buy-to-lets in mortgage arrears, the high number of buy-to-let repossessions and the fact their repossessions and evictions of tenants is a key factor in driving up homelessness.<\/p><p>Policy was adjusted to encourage foreign investors in the sector.  In 2013, real estate investment trusts, REITs, rental profits were made exempt from corporation tax and from that point on there were significant increases in the number of investor house and apartment purchases.  The figure was up to almost 40% in the first quarter of 2017.  For the policy shift to work, investment in the private rental sector must be attractive, which means highly profitable.  This equates to huge house prices, high rents, limited security of tenure and no effective rent caps.  It also means there will be a continuing housing and homelessness crisis.  Over 3,000 homeless children are collateral damage for the Government.<\/p> <p> It is also an expensive policy for the State.  If the target relating to HAP in Rebuilding Ireland is reached - it is 87,000 new units - the cost will be &euro;23.8 billion higher than building a similar number of council units.  This is the madness of capitalism and the failure of Rebuilding Ireland.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is so concerned about the emergency, it has the opportunity, by means of the confidence and supply agreement, to make a real difference to homelessness in the context of budget 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800032#JJ00300","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530195900,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this matter.  We can have all the statements, post mortems and debates in the world but the reality is that there is a serious problem with homelessness and a lack of housing.  Unless we change once and for all, we are sort of tinkering at the edges.  Unless we change certain things, we will be here next year and the year after talking about this.  We need to work in a co-ordinated way.  If any of us was a Minister today, we could not wave a magic wand and solve this overnight.  We must be honest about that.<\/p>  <p>  There are a few matters to be addressed.  Builders currently get a good kicking in this house but they are paying up to 15% interest on building loans.  They will pay a part of the profits and they will be screwed for bonds.  The reality is that money is not attainable on that side of things.  Whether people wan to believe that or not is up to themselves.  It is what people on the ground know is happening.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct that there are many sites throughout the country that are increasing artificially in value.  They cannot be built upon.  If we look at Sky News, Fox News or Euronews, we can see that Germans and people of every other nationality are looking at the shortage of houses in this country.  They believe this is the investment they need.  Deputy Boyd Barrett correctly stated that there are investment companies and vulture funds getting these people to invest money here.  The bubble has not burst and will not burst because the investors do not know the facts.  These sites have been bought at a price at which it is impossible to build houses because the builders would not get the price to cover construction.  That fact must be faced up to.  The investors will get a ferocious shock down the road.<\/p>  <p>  We must be honest about this.  If I was a Minister this minute, there is no magic wand I could use.  We can kick a Minister and give out to him or her but we must change the system of delivery.  We have all the planning in the world and we have introduced policies for the past ten years.  I see policy document after policy document but ultimately it is about the blocks and mortar that build houses.  It is not about talking.  We have been here before debating provisions allowing people to live over shops, as that might free up accommodation for some people.  We spoke about it and another Deputy educated me about it.  There are certain provisions for disabled access, which I agree with, but not every place in an old building will be suitable in that way.  Although we spoke about this in the D&aacute;il a long time ago, not one council can sort this out without planning, which goes against the intention.  Unless we start working on this, we will not solve the problem.<\/p>  <p>  The Project Ireland 2040 plan indicates that we will have between 225,000 and 290,000 more people in Dublin.  However, we cannot house the numbers that are there at the moment.  Are we going to think outside the box and get a bit of regional development?  Will we see incentives for tax-free areas or something like that to entice people to other parts of the country, including rural areas?  They may want to go.  Will we give them facilities, including transport, that might bring about a workable solution?  It might not be for everyone but it will be for some.<\/p>  <p>  There is another big problem coming down the line.  I have spoke with members of the Construction Industry Federation and I have seen this day in and day out.  I come from a construction background.  I have driven diggers but one cannot get a digger driver in Ireland currently.  I have spoken with Senator Ian Marshall and he tells me a machine driver will now go to England the minute he or she has a ticket for a job paying &pound;27 per hour.  We are in trouble.  If we cannot dig out a site and prepare foundations, we cannot build a house.  It is the same with the roads.  We are living in a little fantasy world thinking that houses will appear from somewhere but we do not have the foundations we require in place.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at different ideas to entice people.  Some people will criticise me for saying the following straight out.  Now and again I see on the television people complaining about a house not being big enough.  I grew up in a two-bedroom house from the day I was born and it did us for a while until I could build my own house.  We had to do with it because we did not have the money to do any better.  That must be said.  We did not have all the luxuries.  I slept in a room where my mother and father, God rest them, were for a certain length.  It was the reality in parts of rural Ireland, where ten and 12 people lived in a house.  We were all right as there were four of us.  The girls were in one room but I was the lad so I had to go somewhere else.  It must be said that it will not be all lovely for a while when people are in a position where they cannot provide for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  We must start addressing the lack of house building.  The State owns much land, including in the big cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick where there are major housing problems.  We need a system where the land can be brought on board and there must be a delivery system.  We can have all the plans and ideas but if there is no delivery system, we are stuck.  We should face the fact that councils are not fit to deliver because the volume we need will not come from just tipping along and building a few units every year.  We need a ferocious effort to be put in.  When this is done, we must put in a certain amount for the garda&iacute;, nurses and people on average wages and cannot afford homes.  Unless we decide to help them as well as providing social housing, we will have a major problem.<\/p>  <p>  It is grand to talk in here.  Six months ago we discussed living over the shop, an idea I raised during talks to form the Government a long time ago.  We are proceeding at a snail's pace, however, and somebody must wake and say this should be done in a week or two weeks.  It should not be about passing it here or there and waiting a while for reams of paper with no delivery.  Until we start doing things like that, we are going nowhere.  We need to look at the broader picture and include transport as well.  Driving from A to B, infrastructure is the problem.  It is fine that every youngster wants to go to college but even if we have the most highly-educated people, if we want an office for Google, Facebook or anybody else in any city, we will need somebody to dig the road and put in the stone.  We have a problem with quarries and the environmentalists do not want us to take out stone, although they want houses.<\/p><p>One plus one is amounting to four in that case and what they are talking about does not add up.  The Department has gone down the road of making it hard for quarries to survive.  They cannot survive.  The small quarries are gone because of the way legislation is being designed.  That means everything is dearer.  It means that the likes of CRH can rule the world and that the prices of all the products are going up.  The small operation is kicked around the place and is no longer feasible.  There is no point in saying that the opposite is the case.<\/p> <p> We need to go back to the basics.  We need to ensure that we have the skills.  Regardless of whether we like builders, the reality is that we need them.  If we do not have people who are skilled in building, then we may end up solving one problem, that is, the money, but saddled with another, namely, that relating to sites and getting State land.  The third problem is ensuring that we have people to build.  At present, we have a major problem throughout the country.  There are many investment funds.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, the vultures are sitting on land.  The land is at a price such that no one could afford to build a house on it.  A person would need &euro;500,000 for some of the houses once we include all that is needed.  Who can afford that?  Until these matters are addressed, the Department is in trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800033#KK00200","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530196500,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The Minister informed us earlier that the figures for this month show an increase of 12 in the number of families that are homeless.  A total of 57 adults and, heartbreakingly, 137 children have become homeless since the previous set of figures.  The Minister told us not to panic and that the figures do not paint the whole picture.  He set out other provisos to try to convince us that things are not as grim as they seem, but they clearly are.  Then again, no one here has children who are homeless.  However, we know the people who have because we see them coming through our doors and we see the impact it has on them.<\/p>  <p>  While we talk about this matter, as we have done 100 times before, outside these doors the numbers simply keep on rising.  These are not simply numbers, they are real people.  The lives of over 3,000 actual children are on hold or up in the air.  Their future is uncertain and their opportunities will be limited.  Unless their situations are reversed, the cycle of lack of opportunity will continue.  They will be subject to the inevitable disadvantage and social exclusion that results from a childhood spent on the periphery of society.<\/p>  <p>  The \"My Name Is\" campaign has done a good job in putting faces to the statistics.  The various outreach groups on the front line have helped as well, including Inner City Helping Homeless, Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland, Simon Communities Ireland and Threshold.  They are doing amazing work on a day-to-day basis but it is merely scratching the surface.  I have heard those organisations described as \"our partners\" by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as if they are the providers of public services.  They were set up to fulfil a function but they were never meant to provide public services.  They have a different function.  In any event, all this prevents them from fulfilling the role of advocating more strongly when there is a dependence coming from the Department as well.  That is an entirely unhealthy situation.  We cannot allow a situation whereby voluntary NGOs are expanding in order to try to pick up the pieces.  That should be done by the Government and the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I commented on this issue three years ago and said it was a great irony.  When a mother and her newborn baby are leaving a maternity hospital, the staff will not let them leave unless a baby seat is fitted in the car.  However, no one inquires whether they have a home.  There is a great irony in that.  I have come across situations where people have left hospital and entered into a situation of homelessness.  I imagine others have as well.  Where are those children to go once the mother has left the hospital?  How can they get developmental checks when they are on the move all the time?  What about the visits from the public health nurse?  What about the other safety nets through which children are increasingly falling?  The Department of Education and Skills is not entirely engaged with this process.  We find that children are missing important milestones.<\/p>  <p>  I have also heard alarming reports of concerns &ndash; I will not put it any stronger than that &ndash; on the part of some public health nurses about the rate of sudden infant and cot deaths.  That needs to be examined to see whether the concerns are real.  I have no wish to scaremonger but that requires some consideration.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot continue to appease our consciences by claiming that homeless hubs are the solution.  In reality, they are modern-day tenements.  They are potentially worse because there is no long-term security for the families.  That permeates everything.  Often, I find that the parent is utterly stressed when she comes to meet me.  I know that transfers through the family.  The first time someone came through the door of my constituency office and told me that she and her seven year old child were sleeping in a car was in 2014.  We were told that this was a supply side issue and that it takes time to build houses.  That was four years ago.  We keep being told that it takes time to build houses.  However, the number of local authority houses that have been built since then is negligible in comparison to the increase in the problem.<\/p>  <p>  Several issues have been raised in this debate.  One relates to place finder team.  The week before last, I was dealing with five families who are homeless.  One family was not actually homeless but was going to become so the following week.  I contacted the county council and was told off.  I was told to send them here and send them there.  Apparently, we were \"misdirecting\" them &ndash; that was the term used.  I do not know where I should have directed them, but, in any event, apparently I was misdirecting them.  It might take several weeks before these homeless families can be assessed.  I know this sounds daft, but sometimes I envy the services in place in Dublin, which has a specific homeless service.  I realise I should not say that, because the epicentre of the problem is in Dublin city centre.  I call on the Minister of State to show me this place finder team and to prove that it is working, because I do not see it.<\/p>  <p>  The actual homeless figures that are published do not include the number of children who are in overcrowded and temporary accommodation.  Some are self-accommodated with relatives and friends.  It is not unusual to see whole families sharing one bedroom that a relative has offered.  I imagine other Deputies will testify to the same thing.  That is self-accommodation but it is not really counted as homelessness.  The definition of \"homelessness\" is the absence of \"one family, one home\".  That was one of the housing action group demands in the 1960s or early 1970s.  Yet, here we are after a vast amount of so-called development and we are further back in some cases than we were in the 1960s and early 1970s.<\/p>  <p>  I have said before that I believe we need a war effort to deal with this.  However, I do not see such an effort.  Moreover, I do not believe the figures I see coming from the Department.  We were told three or four years ago, during the term of the previous Government, that money was not an object.  I am of the view that we have misspent much of it by investing in HAP as a solution.  HAP has not delivered additional houses.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 7,500 individuals or families are on waiting lists in Kildare.  Housing is certainly being built.  I see housing estates being built in my area, but I do not see the amount of units that need to be built.<\/p><p>Many are very expensive and I do not know how people will be able to afford them, which is another issue.  <\/p> <p> Not long into his tenure, the Taoiseach told us that when one compared the Irish homelessness situation with that of other countries, it was not a whole lot worse.  I am paraphrasing him, but the problem is that a sense of normality has crept into this debate.  There is a normality about children not having the security of their own homes.  There is also normality about the kind of homelessness figures that are produced monthly and that we need in order to measure whether there has been progress or otherwise.  That is something we should caution against.  We are storing up really serious problems for the future.  We cannot fix these problems by throwing money at them.  We will have to provide public services to undo the damage that has been done by not addressing this issue at this point.  The solution is to build houses and to do so in the numbers needed.  I agree with the point made by local authorities.  I do not think the will is there.  I question whether they want to be involved in the delivery of houses because it is incredibly slow, even in the context the numbers that have been promised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800034#LL00200","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530197100,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It is no harm to discuss this matter again.  Our previous debate on this matter was in December.  It is no harm to discuss it again because doing so can bring it into focus once more.  We probably have conversations about different aspects of homelessness and housing in the D&aacute;il every week.  However, this debate has focused on homelessness among children and the difficulties they experience.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Catherine Murphy that the Minister, the Taoiseach and I do not accept that there is any type of normality attaching to this issue.  The Taoiseach is very focused on the housing brief and he works very closely with the Minister, the Department and me.  We are all very focused on homelessness, the housing shortage and the housing emergency, especially among children, which is the Government's number one priority.  Everyone accepts that bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels or emergency accommodation are not suitable settings in which to raise children.  It is unfair to even suggest that what we are discussing has become normal or accepted.  That is not the case.  While we are trying to increase the supply of housing and deal with the shortage that exists, every effort is being made to provide the best services possible to people in emergency situations until we can find more long-term solutions.  Many solutions have been offered and we try to deal with them while we are waiting for new housing to come on stream.  However, it is not the case that homelessness has become acceptable or normalised.  No one is accepting that, nor would we.  Week in, week out we are here debating the matter and the committees never stop debating it.  All parties are working away on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice is correct that there is no magic wand or quick-fix solution that will solve the problem tomorrow.  Deputy Catherine Murphy said that she wants a war effort.  Nobody here has provided a silver bullet and said to the Minister, the Department or me that if we implement a particular solution today, the problem will be solved tomorrow.  It does not work that way; we wish it did because we would do it.  We are putting forward a range of solutions by means of the action plan.  The latter, which was introduced almost two years ago, is updated all the time.  We try new solutions every day of the week.  The plan has been used to introduce many solutions and thousands of families have been helped.  We all know and accept, including the Minister, that it is not enough but we are constantly trying to provide new solutions, ideas and options that will bring on the supply of housing.  However, there is no quick fix.  There is a skills shortage.  There is also the issue of land and a range of other matters, but we have tried interventions in every sector to bring forward new supply and it is coming on stream.  That will help us solve the housing shortage but we want to increase supply further.  State-owned lands and private lands are all being brought forward but there are many different solutions.<\/p>  <p>  There are data which show that new houses are being built, despite people here telling me constantly for years that there are no houses being built.  We now know that some houses are being built.  It is not enough for everybody but the CSO is counting them and has stated that in the context of housing supply - which is the solution to this problem - more than14,500 new houses were built last year.  An additional 1,000 houses in ghost estates also came on stream and a further 2,600 that were vacant for more than two years were brought back into the system.  Those are all houses that help provide solutions and homes.  We know we are making the right progress but it is not enough.  We want to do more but it is wrong to say that nothing is happening or that there has been no change.  We would like it to happen more quickly and we are working with local authorities to facilitate that.  Taxpayers' money has been allocated to solve this problem.  More than &euro;1.9 billion will be spent this year.  An amount of &euro;118 million will be specifically designated in respect of homelessness.  This is an increase on last year's amount and its purpose is to try to focus on providing a better service to those in emergency accommodation, thousands of whom are children.  We do not want them there and want to provide solutions as quickly as we can.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister or I thank the front-line people - the local authorities, approved housing bodies and those in our Department, other Departments and NGOs - and call them partners, that is because they are doing a lot of the work.  Some use taxpayers' money and some do not, some ask for taxpayers' money and some do not and some offer to provide more services and use taxpayers' money to pay for them.  We call them partners because we are all using taxpayers' money.  It is important that taxpayers know that their money is being spent on the front line, that it is providing some of these solutions and that it helped more than 4,700 people leave homeless situations last year.  It is not enough to deal with the entire problem or give all those involved homes but there is a bit of movement with people leaving emergency accommodation and getting houses.  Thankfully, the majority do not spend as long in emergency accommodation as used to be the case.  Some are in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and hubs.  Hubs are not perfect but they are much better than commercial hotels and are provided as a temporary solution only.  The majority of people move through hubs quite quickly before moving to HAP houses, rented houses or more permanent situations.<\/p>  <p>  The homelessness situation is not accepted as being normal and we are trying to work with everyone to bring forward solutions.  It is about presentations and prevention.  In many cases, we step in to prevent people becoming homeless which is a good use of taxpayers money to keep a person in their house.  Some say that there are problems with HAP.  Thousands avail of it and find it good, others do not but they are a minority.  However, HAP is a temporary solution.  The actual solution is housing supply and that is the Department's focus.  This year, there will be an additional 8,000 social houses come into the system.  They are not all brand-new builds - some of them will be acquired, leased and so on - but they will be in the system to help provide homes that were not there last year.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the issues raised by Deputy Fizmaurice on the skills agenda and so on.  There is much that we can do and we are at different stages on different things but much sense has been talked.  It is about housing supply and ensuring that our land is used, which is what we are trying to do.

I am very disappointed that the Minister is not here to answer for his decisions but I know that the Minister of State will relay my concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Limerick early intervention service and school-age teams have written to parents in the region to say that only urgent cases for those children who attend the school-age children's services aged six to 18 years in Blackberry Park can now be dealt with due to the lack of psychology staff and resources and all other children are to be put on waiting lists.  This is completely unacceptable.  These services are vital for children.  Everyone knows that early intervention is key to addressing many problems.  I have been in contact with the service in Limerick and this is the very last thing that it wanted to do.  It is completely overwhelmed and understaffed and receiving no help.  In this letter, urgent cases are defined as children who are self-harming or have suicidal ideas, children who are hurting others and children whose school placement is at risk of breaking.  This should not be the standard at which we provide these critical services.  It is completely unacceptable that children, other than those in these extreme cases, are expected to go on waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  I brought this matter to the Minister's attention in February when I raised concerns about the waiting lists and lack of staff in the service in Limerick.  At that stage the figures showed lengthy waiting times for children.  I had hoped that by bringing it to the Minister's attention action taken.  It is clear, however, that nothing has been done.<\/p><p> This problem has escalated severely since then.  The lack of staff and resources in this service in Limerick is astonishing.  I have been in contact with the senior clinical psychologist in the school age service, Dr. Moore, who has worked in the service for nine years.  She said that when she started the caseload was 120 children but that it is now 410.  Despite this, there is just one full-time and one part-time senior grade clinical psychologist to deal with the massive workload.  Staffing has not increased despite the trebling of the caseload.  How is this allowed to happen?  How is this continuing?<\/p> <p> The Government is currently deciding how much money it can put away in the rainy day fund.  How can the Minister of State tell me that hundreds of millions of euro are better used by being left sitting in a bank account than by giving a tiny fraction to this incredibly important service for children?  What does the Minister of State have to say about this and what actions will he take?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800035#MM00700","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530197700,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Maurice Quinlivan for raising this very important issue and highlighting this need.  I am pleased to confirm that a Programme for a Partnership Government commits this Government to improving services and increasing supports for people with disabilities, particularly early assessment and intervention for children with special needs.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government supports the Blackberry early intervention service in Limerick in providing a service to 410 children with very complex needs.  A high proportion of the children on the caseload require urgent intervention.  Following a recent review of the psychology service, all parents were informed of the need to prioritise the waiting list based on need and that a psychology intervention waiting list was being created.  There are now two waiting lists for psychology intervention services - an urgent list and a standard list.  Urgent cases will be prioritised for intervention and these include: children who are self-harming, to whom the Deputy referred, or who have suicidal ideas; children who are hurting others; and children whose school placement is at risk of breaking down.  All other referrals will be placed on the standard psychology waiting list in order of date of referral to the service.  The letter the Deputy refers to did not state that only extreme urgent cases can be dealt with.  Children already involved with the psychology service will continue to receive their intervention as planned.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to support Blackberry early intervention teams to deliver services in line with the service agreements.  I support the Deputy's genuine concern.  It is recognised that early intervention services and services for school aged children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively.  This process has started and is well under way.  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographically based teams for children aged from zero to 18 years.  The objective of the new model of assessment and intervention is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children under 18 years, irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend.  In addition, funding of &euro;5 million was provided in 2016 for the development of psychology services in primary care with a focus on enhanced counselling interventions for children and adolescents.  The recruitment process for 114 assistant psychology posts and 20 staff grade psychologists is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800036#NN00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1530197700,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  To be honest I am disappointed.  The Minister of State said that I said that only extreme urgent cases would be dealt with.  He is probably right there, but the letter basically said that the waiting list for psychological intervention is likely to be extensive and it urged parents to seek support from other local agencies.  Parents read that to mean that they were to find support themselves and get whatever other resources or funding they could find out about.  Parents in Limerick are extremely concerned about this development.  The services are critical for some children.  When I raised this issue back in February the waiting list for school age services was huge.  At that stage the number of children on waiting lists for school age assessment and intervention stood at 632.  Some 577 children were on the school age waiting list for intervention alone, with 245 of these waiting for more than eight months for intervention.  These are truly shocking figures.<\/p>  <p>  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 states that every child with special needs is entitled to an education and the notion of inclusion is promoted in that Act.  Inclusion, however, is not a reality on the ground as the supports are simply not there to allow for it.  The solution is very straightforward.  Limerick early intervention services and school age teams need more staff, more funding and more resources immediately.  I urge the Minister of State to look into the case I have highlighted, to make contact with the HSE and to ensure the service is provided with what it needs to deliver its services for children in Limerick.  I take this opportunity to commend the staff in the Limerick early intervention services and school age teams for working so hard for so many children with the few resources it has.  The solution is straightforward and the benefits for these children and their families will be massive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800036#NN00300","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1530197700,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Quinlivan for his question.  I agree with him about commending the staff.  They do an excellent job.  I was in Limerick recently and I saw at first hand the fantastic work that is done with young adults with intellectual disabilities in respect of third level education and inclusive education.  This is very much in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I know Limerick is leading on that particular issue.  The Deputy's concerns are genuine.  We need immediate action.  I will relay the Deputy's concerns to the Minister.  I agree with him that services are critical.  The shortage of psychologists is an issue.  That is something we are dealing with in other counties as well.  However, the process of recruiting 114 assistant psychologists and 20 staff grade psychologists is ongoing.  That should improve the situation.<\/p>  <p>  On the waiting lists, I have no difficulty in saying that the Limerick early intervention service is doing an excellent job.  The fact that it is dealing with 410 children and that it has these long waiting lists is something we have to deal with.  I also recognise that the first class early intervention services and the services for school age children with disabilities are paramount.  There are challenges, however.  I accept that.  It is expected that the transition of services into multidisciplinary geographically based teams will improve waiting times for children accessing early intervention services.  The HSE and partner agencies will remain fully committed to the delivery of needs-based services to children with complex needs within the mid-west disability services, based on evidence-based practice.  <\/p>  <p>  On a personal level, over the coming weeks we in the Department of Health will be having talks with the HSE in respect of the Estimates.  I have put early intervention services in my top five priorities.  I also have to deal with crises in emergency residential services for older adults with intellectual disabilities, but the issues the Deputy raised today are on my priority list.  Many colleagues concur with the Deputy.  There is great support for the issue in the House.  They see the problem.  We need to do it, but we also have staffing issues.  We have shortages of people and recruitment issues.  We are really working hard in going abroad and trying to attract many of our psychologists and speech and language therapists whom we lost over recent years back to Ireland.

The school-going population at secondary level has multiplied in that time so that the demand now extends to 2,000 secondary school places.  In this context an application was made for an extension of the then secondary school, Maynooth post-primary school, in 2009.  Unfortunately, at that point a very sorry saga began to unfold.  After that application for an extension was made, it was decided that, rather than extending the building, a new school was to be built and that another new school was to commence enrolling in the town.  Maynooth community college was announced in 2012 and commenced enrolment in 2014.  The decision to proceed with these two schools as two new school buildings on the Moyglare Road in Maynooth was made and the process began.  Unfortunately, even after those decisions were made the process was fraught with delay.  After painstakingly getting from 2012, when the decision was made to open Maynooth community college, to 2014, when it began enrolment, and on to 2016, when the tender finally issued, a problem then arose with the tender.  Indeed, one of the first meetings I attended after being elected to this House was a meeting with the Minister and the parents and staff of the schools on Maynooth education campus to discuss the issue of that tender.  That tender was sent back to the drawing board to be revised and a new tender was drawn up and awarded to Sammon Construction in 2017.  I was happy to join the Minister, other Oireachtas Members, Councillor Naoise &Oacute; Cear&uacute;il, the local parent groups and school staff at the turning of the sod in 2017.<\/p><p>It appeared at last that things were moving on again for the Maynooth education campus.  Disaster struck last month when the Sammon Group announced it was going into liquidation.  Our sympathies are with the 200 workers from that group, many of whom are local to Kildare and Meath, and the company as a whole.  The company had been in examinership for some months.  Work on the site has ground to a halt.  The school is half built and is at a standstill.  It is in limbo, as is the entire school community.  We understand that tendering must occur again.  The school that was initially due to open in the new buildings in 2016 is now to open in 2020.  It is no less than an unmitigated disaster for parents, students, staff and the entire Maynooth community.<\/p> <p> It is worth noting the conditions in the existing buildings.  The two schools, which are currently located in 18 buildings, towards the bottom of Moyglare Road, are at breaking point.  They lack the physical capacity to take any more students.  There is a one-way system in operation in the current school.  Children must walk one way around in order to avoid bumping into one another.  Including in poor weather, children have to go outside their building to move from one place to another.  Transition year students are already being educated in the shopping centre at Manor Mills, which is separate from the school site.<\/p> <p> Management and students have done their very best but can do no more.  Even allowing for the delays, and had the tender re-awarded in 2017 progressed, it was hoped to be in the new premises by Christmas 2018.  Now they face a best-case scenario of September 2020.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to the school principals, Siobh&aacute;n McCauley and Johnny Nevin, for all the efforts they have made, along with the parent-teacher association and school community, to manage the situation to this point.  They now need some clarity and direction, however.  This is the third tender issued for the schools.  One can say there is no point crying over spilt milk but it beggars belief that, considering the company was in examinership and with a liquidation quite likely, no contingency plan appears to have been put in place.  What would happen if the very predictable outcome, liquidation, actually occurred?  I fail to understand how that was not spotted by the Department or patrons.  What are the next steps?  How quickly can the school be delivered?  Can the process be expedited given the delays that have beleaguered this project for almost ten years at this stage?  What are the best and worst timescales?  I seek answers to give the school community some comfort and clarity regarding the road ahead for the buildings that are so urgently needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800036#NN00500","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530198300,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lawless for raising this issue.  Clearly, this is a very disappointing state of affairs.  Nobody could have anticipated the Sammon Group going into liquidation but that is the situation in which we find ourselves.  We have taken immediate steps to get this project back on track.  Unfortunately, however, the implications of a change of contract are serious.  I do not want to understate the amount of work that has to be done in this regard.  The Deputy will understand that no builder would take over the project without the correct and detailed specifications and the schedule of works and drawings, and without certainty as to what is to be carried out.  The State has to have such certainty in regard to what it is tendering.  Therefore, a substantial amount of work has to be done.  I have briefly summarised it in the statement that has been circulated.  Surveys have to be completed and works need to be undertaken.  This leads to an identification of the works remaining to be carried out by a new contractor.  This is detailed work.  This work is followed by revised drawings, together with updated work schedules.  Tender documents based on the revised work schedules and drawings are prepared.  The works are tendered to the market for a new contractor.<\/p>  <p>  I would love to be able to tell the Deputy that this is simple and fast work.  It has to be done painstakingly and accurately.  My officials have met the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board and its design team.  We have a good team in place.  It is working hard to limit the time it will take to deliver this project.  A critical path has been worked out, with very tight timelines for the various elements.<\/p>  <p>  In order to speed things up, we have agreed that a pre-qualification process for new contractors can be engaged in while the survey work is being done.  Therefore, there will not be a hold-up in that regard.  A tender notice has been published on the e-tenders website seeking expressions of interest from contractors wishing to be considered for the completion of the project.<\/p>  <p>  Another notable development is that the design team has made arrangements to have the precast work in the main structure and the steelwork on the roofs completed, and this is expected to be done by August.  This arrangement will mean the superstructure will be completed and certified and a neat site can be handed over to a new contractor.  We believe that will help to accelerate the delivery of the project.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the identification of all other outstanding works to complete both schools is ongoing to make ready for the tendering among the pre-qualified contractors in due course.  The current works programme indicates a re-tendering of the project to pre-qualified contractors towards the end of this year with a view to having a contractor back on site by the end of March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been closely liaising with Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board to develop matters and it will continue to liaise with the board until the project satisfactorily reaches completion.  Officials are also working with the board to ensure the needs of the two schools in their existing accommodation are met until their new accommodation is available.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge this is a disappointment to people.  Maynooth is an area I know very well.  As Deputy Lawless said, I was present when the site was opened and noted the optimism that accompanied the opening.  It is disappointing that we had a setback but I am confident that the team we have in place will get this major project back on track.  It is the largest project of this kind ever undertaken by the State, with 2,000 pupil places.  We will endeavour to get it back on track as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800037#OO00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1530198300,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Based on figures I sourced locally, we are still facing a two-year delay.

In terms of direct investment in the form of grant aid, a total of &euro;1.84 million has been paid to IDA Ireland client companies in Meath since 2013.  There has been some significant investment in the county in past two years, with Shire announcing plans to expand its global biotechnology manufacturing capacity over the next four years.  It is expected that this will lead to the creation of approximately 400 permanent jobs at Piercetown, County Meath.  This news followed Facebook&rsquo;s announcement in January 2016 of the construction of a new data centre in Clonee.  Construction for the &euro;200 million data centre is currently taking place with over 1,000 workers now on site daily.<\/p>  <p>  The county&rsquo;s proximity to transport hubs and population centres is among its key strengths.  IDA Ireland is working hard to secure new investment for Meath and it continues to draw the attention of investors to the county.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be emphasised that foreign direct investment only forms one part of investment in regional locations.  Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland-supported companies continue to perform well in the regions, with a 5% increase in employment reported in Meath in 2017.  Enterprise Ireland has approximately 500 client companies in the mid-east region with 170 of these located in County Meath, employing some 7,300 people.  Enterprise Ireland has invested almost &euro;8 million in the period from 2014 to 2017 in these companies.  Last year, Enterprise Ireland supported companies created 650 jobs in Meath.  When losses are taken into account, a net gain of 309 jobs was recorded.  This is an increase of 4.2% on 2016.  Some key Enterprise Ireland client companies include Kepak, Nurendale, Largo Foods, Kilsaran Concrete and Xtratherm.  In June, with the support of Enterprise Ireland, I announced College Group&rsquo;s &euro;10 million expansion with the construction of a new biofuel facility in Nobber, with the creation of 90 construction jobs and an additional 25 long-term job opportunities for graduates.  Enterprise Ireland also co-funded the establishment of three community enterprise centres in County Meath.  In January 2016, we launched the mid-east action plan for jobs to support enterprise and employment across Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  This plan aims to increase employment in the region by 10% to 15% by 2020, resulting in the delivery of 31,500 jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Substantial progress is being made in the mid-east.  Since the start of 2015, 22,800 more people are in employment in the region.  The mid-east now has an unemployment rate of 5.4%, lower than the State rate of 5.7%.  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland jobs increased by 4% in the mid-east while IDA Ireland jobs across the region grew by 6%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800038#PP00400","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1530199500,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Again, the Minister of State lumped Meath in with that mid-east region.  I identified in my first contribution that there are radical inequalities even within that mid-east region.<\/p>  <p>  The second thing the Minister of State did was what his Government does regularly, namely, when we show a systematic problem, a Minister points to the exceptions that prove the rule.  Of course there are individual cases that are against the trend to which I have referred, but the trend is still significant and needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is that the Minister of State failed to address the question of Government investment in County Meath.  In this regard, local authority expenditure in Meath is &euro;537 per person.  We are the only county in the State for which the figure is less than &euro;600.  In Cork, that investment is &euro;1,217 per person.  Why should a Government preside over well over double the allocation of investment in one county over another?  The most frustrating thing about this trend is that it is actually getting worse.  Year after year I have brought up this issue.  We have a heap of Fine Gael Deputies in County Meath.  Probably the only statistic we excel in is Fine Gael Deputies per capita.  Perhaps that is why the problem exists in the first place.  It is deeply frustrating.  Those Fine Gael Deputies have told us to raise the revenue locally.  To do so in respect of increases in rents, parking fees, etc., we would have to raise our revenue generation locally by approximately 180%, which would radically squeeze people in Meath.<\/p>  <p>  The heart of this problem, which has not been seen, is that there has been a 78% increase in population in Meath in 20 years.  We have seen the largest increase in population of any county during that period, and the central government model of funding does not take into consideration this demographic change whatsoever.  As a result, Meath people contribute approximately &euro;4,100 per capita yet get far less back per capita from the State in investment.  I do not begrudge any other county its investment.  I commend any county on securing investment.  All we are looking to do is equalise the investment per capita throughout the State in order that the people in Meath get a fair shot of IDA investment, EI investment and State investment.  If this is not done, Fine Gael will continue to stuff, hammer and shaft people in Meath.  I call on the Minister of State to ensure that per capita investment change is made under this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800039#QQ00100","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1530199500,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n was selective himself at the beginning of his reply.

As I state in my preface to the report, while some progress in this area had been made since the publication of the 2013 report on penal reform of our predecessor committee, the current joint committee deemed it appropriate to readdress the issue of penal reform and sentencing, and we have made it a priority issue over the past two years.  The committee was keen to identify the issues affecting Irish prisons, and we held engagements with seven stakeholder groups in this area, including the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the Victims' Rights Alliance, the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service, the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, the Prison Officers' Association and Simon Communities Ireland.<\/p><p>In the course of evidence presented during the committee's engagement with stakeholders, it became abundantly clear that in Ireland there are still many issues with the penal system, particularly in respect of prison numbers, the systematic overuse of imprisonment as punishment, and the need to promote awareness and acceptance of sentencing alternatives.  It also became clear that the conditions in prisons themselves are unacceptable and that far more needs to be done to rehabilitate offenders, to reduce reoffending and to minimise the impact of crime on victims and the community.  The committee's report contains 29 recommendations which, if implemented, would, we believe, help to address the issues identified regarding the penal system.<\/p><p>While the daily population of prisons in Ireland is average by European standards, the rate of committal to Irish prisons remains very high, with a dramatic increase in the population of women in prison and being sent to prison.  Additionally, evidence showed that the one-size-fits-all philosophy, with a reliance on the closed prisons system, was found to be inappropriate to prison environments.  Strategies must be adopted to reduce the overall prison population.  The committee would like to see a more flexible approach to the prison system whereby there are semi-open facilities.  A variety of restriction and supervision should be adopted, with prisoners engaging in more meaningful out-of-cell time.  Daily routines should reflect a normal day, and regimes should be programme-driven.  Accommodation across the board should be single-cell occupancy only.  The committee encourages the phasing out of solitary confinement, which should be used only in the most extreme circumstances, and calls on the Government to facilitate the passage of Deputy Clare Daly's Private Members' Bill, the Prisons (Solitary Confinement) (Amendment) Bill 2016, to address this issue.<\/p><p>There is a particular need to address the young adult prison population, that is, those in the 18-to-24 age group.<\/p><p>Further education opportunities should be made available through a pairing arrangement with third level institutions and accommodation should be provided as appropriate in stand-alone housing settings with single-room occupancy, communal dining and food preparation facilities.  Every effort possible should be employed to help reduce the prospect of reoffending from this age category.<\/p> <p> The committee also believes that better facilitating family visits could motivate behavioural change in prisoners by maintaining as normal a family life as possible.  In addition developing mother-and-baby units to facilitate female offenders in cohabiting with their children on the basis of the needs of the child would promote a similar result.<\/p> <p> A final point on conditions relates to the management of healthcare in Irish prisons.  Many issues arise with waiting lists and appointments.  The committee recommends that a review of healthcare in Irish prisons be undertaken and that responsibility for healthcare be transferred to the HSE.<\/p> <p> One of the focal points of the report is that of minor criminal offences, which are exacerbating the issue of overcrowding in prisons.  The committee recommends adopting alternative forms of sentencing for these offences in particular, including non-payment of fines, which accounts for more than 50% of annual committals.  Community-based sanctions and non-custodial sentences are often more effective and far less costly than incarceration.  This was a recommendation of the 2013 report and should be implemented.  In addition, people must be facilitated to pay their fines by instalment, reducing the threshold for payment and extending the repayment schedule in the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014.<\/p> <p> As for drug offences, there is a lack of utilisation of the existing legislation whereby instead of imposing a fine or prison sentence, a court may place an offender under the supervision of a body or require the offender to undergo treatment or complete a course of education or training to improve their job prospects.  The committee believes this legislation would facilitate social rehabilitation and reduce reoffending if it were utilised sufficiently.<\/p> <p> The operation of the community return scheme, an incentivised scheme for the supervised release of qualifying prisoners who undertake unpaid community work as a condition of their early release, is supported by the committee, which heard evidence suggesting the scheme has been very successful.  It is hoped the scheme will be expanded to attract more prisoners and more categories of community service.<\/p> <p> The issue of spent convictions requires urgent address.  Offenders carrying the consequence of a criminal record for the rest of their lives if they have moved on from offending behaviour must be reassessed.  Certain situations such as addiction, youth or poverty can contribute to offending behaviour.  The committee believes these circumstances should be taken into account with regard to spent convictions.<\/p> <p> The report highlights the high percentage of people, approximately 70%, entering prison with an addiction or substance-abuse problem.  Related to this are issues of mental health.  While certain facilities are available within the penal system, emphasis must be placed on ensuring prisoners have access to the appropriate rehabilitation facilities and on providing adequate resources to prison staff.  Vulnerable care units should be established in all prisons, modelled on the Mountjoy high-support unit, which has seen great success in moving from pharmacological treatments to therapy interventions.<\/p> <p> As a related issue, the report outlines the ongoing issue of housing shortage being directly related to reoffending as with offenders being released from prison into emergency accommodation, a number end up sleeping rough.  Providing stable accommodation and supports would help to counteract this issue.  The committee recommends an integrated cross-departmental approach to address these issues and again the housing first approach would be a good starting point.<\/p> <p> To continue on the issue of reoffending, the report also outlines the need for prisons to have more constructive settings for preparing an offender to re-enter society.  Educational facilities should be available to equip prisoners with necessary skills for returning to society.  The report emphasises a focus on the mental health of the prisoner to prepare them psychologically for re-entry to society.  Providing these facilities and preparing the person for re-entry to society is fundamental to reducing the rate of recidivism.<\/p> <p> The report highlights issues regarding victims of crime and restorative justice.  Consideration should be given to a new approach to penalising offenders while simultaneously assisting victims of crime.  We should fine the offender and put the funds into a victim-support service.  This may be a means by which an offender can avoid prison and instead contribute back to the community through the money he or she is paying towards the victims fund.<\/p> <p> The report contains 29 recommendations.  The committee took a great deal of time over the report as this is such an important area of its work and it is vital that we get it right.  I believe we have got it right and I therefore urge the Minister for Justice and Equality and his Government colleagues to give the report their detailed consideration and to begin implementing its recommendations forthwith.  As a society, we cannot afford to ignore this report's findings.  The Government, as the vehicle for change, has a duty to heed and to act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800039#QQ01500","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530200100,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the committee for its report on penal reform and sentencing.  As I mentioned at the committee two weeks ago, the report is detailed and comprehensive.  It has many implications across a range of services and bodies to which the Cathaoirleach has referred.  I agree the recommendations of the report are such that they require examination on my part.  I assure the Cathaoirleach, members of the committee and the House that my officials are currently examining them.  I would be very happy to engage further with the committee when that process is complete.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the report as a valuable contribution to the debate on the issues of penal reform and sentencing.  I take the opportunity to give details of the many progressive reforms that have taken place in recent times, as well as some future plans which are in the process of being implemented and which have relevance to many of the issues raised in the report.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the strategic review of penal policy produced by the penal policy review group and published in September 2014 advocates an approach to crime and the penal system that emphasises rehabilitation.  It calls for an improved penal system, the reduction of reliance on imprisonment as a sanction and increased focus on alternatives.  These are very much the themes which reflect the spirit of the report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Mary Rogan is the independent chairperson of the implementation and oversight group established in early 2015 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the review group.  This group comprises officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It reports to me on a six-monthly basis on the implementation status of the recommendations of the group.<\/p><p>The group has presented five reports to me to date, all of which were published on the Department's website.  The implementation of the group's recommendations constitutes the broad reform programme of penal policy being undertaken.  From initial examination of the recommendations of the committee's report, many are linked with and complementary to the report of the PPRG.<\/p> <p> I will address a number of issues raised in the report.  In terms of prison numbers, Ireland has a relatively low rate of imprisonment by international standards.  According to the most recent published statistics, Ireland's imprisonment rate is 78.1 per 100,000 of population.  The equivalent European average is 129.9.  The median figure is 117.1.  Of 50 countries surveyed by the Council of Europe, only 11 have lower imprisonment rates than Ireland.  The PPRG recommended the adoption of a strategy to reduce prisoner numbers to a safe level subject to the need to ensure proper protection of the public.  In light of this, my officials are drafting a strategy which is expected to be finalised by the end of this year.  I assure the House the recommendations made in the committee's report in this area will be fully considered in the context of developing that strategy.  <\/p> <p> With regard to females in prison, the planned redevelopment of a new female prison in Limerick will provide, in addition to 42 single occupancy rooms, an additional eight independent living areas.  The capacity of Limerick female prison is 28.  The stand-alone facility within the prison, with all the required ancillary services, will greatly enhance the accommodation regimes and supports available to women.  The development of a step-down facility for female prisoners, which will be going to tender shortly, is intended to allow such women, who have served a large portion of their sentence in a closed prison environment, to gain some normalisation skills through living in a semi-independent manner.  I acknowledge what the Chairman of the committee said in his contribution on this issue of living in a semi-independent manner and moving towards independence, all of which is necessary in the context of the reintegration, at some future date, of the prisoner into society.<\/p> <p> I will mention healthcare for prisoners.  Prisoners have wide-ranging and sometimes complex healthcare needs.  The 2014 report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment recommended a fundamental review of healthcare services in Irish prisons and that the provision of healthcare in Irish prisons should be part of the general health service.  This recommendation was underscored by the 2016 Healthcare in Irish Prisons report by the late Inspector of Prisons, which made a similar recommendation.  This independent review will take place following the recruitment of the executive clinical lead as the central point of contact for the Irish Prison Service.  This appointment will be announced shortly.  Terms of reference will be finalised by my Department, the Department of Health and the Irish Prison Service.  I will then engage a competitive process to select an independent body to undertake the review.  An interdepartmental group to examine issues relating to people with mental illness who come in contact with the criminal justice system was also set up.  This includes representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the HSE, the National Forensic Mental Health Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the DPP and the Irish Prison Service.  The interdepartmental group's first interim report was published in September 2016.  The report sets out the work of the interdepartmental group with regard to how diversion could be facilitated where appropriate at all stages of the criminal justice process up to the conclusion of a criminal trial.  <\/p> <p> The second report of the group explores matters relating to mental health services for prisoners, matters relating to patients detained under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 and post-release mental health services for former prisoners.  This report will be published shortly.  The implementation of the recommendations of both reports will be considered very soon thereafter.  Many of the committee's recommendations cover areas related to both the interdepartmental group report and the review of health in prisons.  The degree of broad consensus on objectives is worthy of note.<\/p> <p> I will refer to what the Chairman of the justice committee has said on the issue of post-release.  They are not issues upon which we disagree, although I am sure the Chairman might disagree with the pace of implementation of change in this regard.  When a prisoner is released from custody, he or she is faced with an entirely new set of challenges.  As a result of the number of different agencies and organisations involved in preparing a prisoner for life after release, it is necessary to have joined-up thinking.  Interagency and interdepartmental working was a key theme emerging from the work of the penal policy review group report.  Homelessness, drug addiction and recidivism are issues being considered by an interagency group chaired by Dr. Ruth Barrington.  I understand this group, which is called the interagency group for a fairer and safer Ireland, will present a report to me over the coming months on its work to date.  The report will be published.  <\/p> <p> The Probation Service is the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in our communities.  It is committed to reducing offending, creating safer communities and having fewer victims through offender rehabilitation.  Two important examples of promoting positive change and reintegration are the community service scheme, which provides a direct alternative to imprisonment for appropriate offenders to perform unpaid work for the benefit of the community, and the community return scheme as an alternative to completing a prison sentence.<\/p> <p> Many offenders have complex needs which require a broad range of support and assistance.  Engagement in education and training and access to behaviour management and treatment services can play a vital role in both rehabilitation and reintegration.  In this respect, in 2017 my Department, through the Probation Service, provided funding of approximately &euro;17 million to a range of community-based organisations.  The Probation Service strategy for 2018-2020, which I launched earlier this week, commits to the further development of a professional service that is effective in reducing the risk of offending.  The Probation Service works closely with the Irish Prison Service to ensure prisoners leaving custody are as best prepared as possible.  Their joint strategic plan 2018-2020, also launched this week, is a practical example of agencies working together.  The strategic objective of the plan is to have a multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation from pre-imprisonment to post-imprisonment in order to reduce reoffending and improve outcomes for prisoners.<\/p> <p> A Government decision was taken in April to proceed with the Private Members' Bill to establish a statutory parole board.  This is in line with the long-standing Government commitment to set up a parole board on a statutory basis.  Following Government approval, drafting has begun on relevant amendments which will be brought on Report Stage.  It is expected these amendments will have been drafted soon.  My Department is continuing to engage with Deputy O'Callaghan on this Bill and I thank him for his work in the area.<\/p> <p> I am aware that over the past few minutes I have only touched on some of the key aspects of the report of the committee.  I will be happy to give an overall view of a system that has undertaken reform and continues to do so.  I thank the Chairman for the report and the committee members for their work in assisting the Chairman in the final production of the report.  It is a most valuable contribution to the process of reform.  It is striking that the committee's report represents a broad, all-party consensus on proposals for a progressive penal system.  It is something that would not have been the case in the House a decade ago.  I acknowledge the Chairman's work in that regard and in ensuring the report has the imprimatur of all parties on the committee and none.  <\/p> <p> I am very pleased this debate is taking place this afternoon.  I am not sure how many further contributions there will be.  I look forward to engaging and I would be happy to keep the committee fully informed of my consideration of aspects of the report and its recommendations.  I am sure that perhaps towards the end of the summer I will have an opportunity of further engaging on this issue.  <\/p><p>This is a comprehensive report that covers many of the most important and challenging issues facing our criminal justice system in the treatment of those persons in society whom the independent courts system deems should be denied their liberty.  It is important that we underline our policy on the prison system with a view to ensuring that when people discharge their sanction and pay their penalty by serving a period in custody and when they acknowledge the time in which their liberty was denied, they will be in a position to reintegrate into society in a way that benefits society, reduces offending and is in everyone's best interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800040#RR00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530201300,"counter":312,"content":"<p>The Committee on Justice and Equality focused on measures that could be taken to decrease the number of people being sent to prison each year.

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture has been critical of the management of healthcare in Irish prisons, noting significant problems with waiting lists and missed appointments for Irish prisoners.  It is recommended, therefore, that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, undertake a fundamental review of healthcare in Irish prisons.  The Department of Health should commission an independent external audit of prison healthcare, and resources should be allocated to ensure the HSE can deliver healthcare effectively in prisons.<\/p>  <p>  The committee supports the recommendation contained in a 2016 report by the former Inspector of Prisons, Mr. Justice Michael Reilly, that responsibility for healthcare in prisons be transferred to the HSE.  It is widely known that people from poor and disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds make up the majority of the prison population.  It is also true that the lower a person's economic background, the poorer his or her health and health outcomes.  With that in mind, it is important that the conditions in prisons are up to the necessary standards to ensure good health among the prison population.  This will mean those in the prison system remain healthy, both physically and mentally.  That is only right and proper as prisoners, too, have rights.  These rights must be upheld regardless of their transgressions.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring good conditions is very important because it means the mental well-being and physical health of prisoners is kept at a level that does not escalate to the need of acute care.  Acute care is more expensive and has additional costs, such as prison officers transporting and monitoring patients.  While some level of acute care will always be necessary, we should ensure all is done that can be done to prevent this escalation of care.  It is important that substance misuse issues are tackled in our prisons and that those in prison have access to addiction treatments and other relevant resources.<\/p>  <p>  Overcrowding is a big problem that leads to issues in terms of prisoner and staff safety, and this is something that must be addressed promptly.  The recommendation to cap prison numbers and reduce the prison population over time through alternative measures must be given serious consideration.  The director general of the Prison Service, Mr. Michael Donnellan, reported this week that huge pressure was being placed on the system because of the need to keep prisoners separated for their own safety.  The State's 11 prisons are being forced to operate segregated regimes and up to 14 gangs are said to be involved.<\/p>  <p>  The annual Prison Service report paints a bleak picture.  The number of prisoners has risen for the first time in seven years and now stands at 3,981.  Overcrowding has become an issue at six of our prisons, including the D&oacute;chas centre for women.  Young adults aged between 18 and 24 should be recognised as a distinct group under the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, along with being paired with third level institutions and availing of opportunities for further education.  My party will support an expansion of Garda youth diversion projects and a focus on prevention and early intervention, rather than coming at the issues with a reactive perspective.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland signed the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture on 2 October 2007 but has yet to ratify the instrument.  When a State ratifies the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, its main obligation is to set up an independent national preventative mechanism to undertake regular visits to places of detention and to formulate recommendations to the authorities.  For the first time, an international treaty focuses on national implementation and provides a national body with specific powers to prevent torture and ill-treatment.  Ratifying the protocol would significantly strengthen inspection and monitoring processes where persons are deprived of their liberty.  I understand there is a body which inspects prisons but I feel this is relevant in the context of detention.  Will the Minister outline if he intends to move towards ratification in the not too distant future.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the justice committee on all the work that went into this report.  In particular, I commend my comrade and Chair of the committee, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800042#TT00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1530201300,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.  This report into penal reform and sentencing is a very good report and I hope it does not just gather dust on the shelf of a Department, like other reports.  There are very many fine and important recommendations within it that deserve to be acted on and I ask the Minister to read it carefully.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the members of the committee who contributed a significant amount of work to produce the report.  In particular, I commend Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who chairs the Committee on Justice and Equality with great diligence and fairness, which is reflected in the fact that the committee works in a politically non-partisan way.  This is not the first report the committee has produced.  It has produced many other equally useful reports and it will produce more reports soon.<\/p>  <p>  This report could not have been produced without the assistance of the people who came before the committee to give evidence and make submissions in respect of a very complex area of law.  In this regard, I acknowledge the role played by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the Victims Rights Alliance, the Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, the Prison Officers Association and the Simon Communities.  They all recognised the complexity of this area, and while each group had its own emphasis and agenda, as they are perfectly entitled to have, the function of politicians and the objective of the committee is to assimilate all these views and present a report that takes into account these conflicting agendas and the conflicting rights that exist in the area of sentencing and penal reform.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of sentencing and penal reform only becomes an operative issue after the commission of a criminal offence, which will necessarily involve the existence of a victim.  It is the function of politicians - the committee in this case - to ensure we balance the rights of victims to have the crimes against them investigated and their perpetrators punished with the responsibility of the State to ensure people who are imprisoned are provided with some form of rehabilitation.  Society has a function to ensure we do not see penal policy and sentencing as being solely related to punishment, as they clearly are not.<\/p>  <p>  This is a difficult balancing act for politicians to perform but we must seek to take into account all conflicting rights.<\/p><p>There are two aspects to the report - sentencing and penal reform.  On sentencing, up to now there has been too much concentration on the sentencing of criminal offences being limited to terms of imprisonment and fines.  This is probably the same all over the world.  Any statute passed, regardless of its nature, generally has within it a reference to offences that can be committed and subsequent to that will be a section setting out the sentence for the commission of the offence.  <\/p> <p> If a case can be prosecuted summarily, there is, in general, provision for a short prison sentence and a small fine and if it can be prosecuted on indictment then, there is a longer prison sentence and a larger fine.  We need to recognise that the sentencing options available to a court need to be broadened.  That obligation rests on the Houses of the Oireachtas but it is also apparent that some sentences could be availed of by courts but they are not.  Paragraph 23 of the report notes that, in the context of drugs offences, there should be more extensive use of non-custodial treatment options for offenders.  It is also important to note that the court may also order that offenders complete a course of education, instruction or training that will improve their job prospects or social circumstances, facilitate their social rehabilitation or reduce their likelihood of committing further drugs offences. <\/p> <p> The report states, correctly, that those options do not seem to be sufficiently utilised in practice.  We need to ensure they are utilised more.  If it is on the Statute Book and not being utilised enough, then we, as the sole and exclusive lawmakers within the State, have to ensure the laws are amended to make sure it is used as a frequent option.  The Minister mentioned the community return scheme, which is also referenced in the report.  We need to recognise that the only option should not be that someone is fined or imprisoned.  People need to be put on community service and receive the benefit of that. <\/p> <p> The other issue is sentencing of youths.  It is a tragedy to see a young person aged 15 or 16 before the Children's Court.  Many of us can see that unless that child is diverted from the path he or she is on at that stage, inevitably, he or she will end up before the courts for the commission of more serious offences.  It is as sure as night follows day.  We need to provide further resources for youth diversion projects and to enhance and protect them.  Additional resources are also needed to ensure that if a child at a young age is identified on a path towards social misbehaviour, leading inevitably towards criminality, that we as a State and republic try to deter that child from continuing on that path.  That is our responsibility and that is not easy.  Let us look at how we would react if that child was in a school and he or she had special needs and special requirements.  We would devote resources to it.  We need to do the same for a child who is identified as being in trouble at an early stage.  <\/p> <p>When it comes to penal reform, prisons are places for violent offenders and sexual offenders likely to reoffend, recidivist offenders continually committing serious crimes and people who engage in the most foolish acts late at night and do not realise the consequences.  Many violent deaths in this country occur as a result of one punch thrown late at night with drink taken.  The individual receiving the punch is momentarily concussed, hits his or her head on the ground and dies.  That has happened on numerous occasions.  Any consultant in Ireland, or in other countries, will identify that the head hitting the ground as the cause of that death.<\/p> <p> In such instances, where there is a family, there also has to be a prison sentence.  It may be that there should also be a prison sentence for people involved in serious financial crimes as well.  I am not trying to provide a list of circumstances where prison is only suitable.  We need to recognise, however, that we need to reduce committals to prisons.  The Minister, and the report, mentioned that we have relatively low rate of committals in Ireland.  The Minister mentioned 78 or 79 per 100,000.  I was pleased that, according to the Prison Service report released early this week, there were 9,287 committals in 2017 compared to 15,100 in 2016.  That is a significant reduction because of new fines legislation.    It does not, unfortunately, appear to have reduced the prison population.<\/p> <p> We gone through this charade for many years where if a person is committed to prison for non-payment of a fine, he or she is in and out momentarily.  We should not put people in prison for failure to pay fines.  We need more innovative measures to deal with that and that was provided for in the 2014 legislation which reformed fines and recovery of payments.  We need to recognise that we need to advance our penal reform and, as the report says, when it comes to addiction and mental health that we do not just abandon people in prison.  If it was anyone close to us had a serious drug problem, it would not be satisfactory for him or her to just be put on methadone or left to cope with another drug.  We need to work to ensure people with mental health and addiction problems in prison are protected.  I could go on because it is an interesting topic and a useful report.  I ask colleagues to read it and the Minister to give it serious consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800042#TT00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530201900,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies and the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in particular, for their contributions to the debate.  I will of take on board the points made.  I welcome the report, which is a valuable contribution to the debate on issues of sentencing and penal reform.  I share its long-standing commitment to this area.  Progressive reforms of the penal policy and modernisation of the prison system have taken place in recent years.  It is an ongoing process of work and I am happy to continue to engage on this with the committee and Members of the House.<\/p>  <p>  The wide-ranging nature of the recommendations in a number of areas is impressive.  Many are linked with, and complementary, to the current reform programme being implemented.  Penal reform is a challenge to tackle.  Reform takes time and patience but it also takes resources and commitment.  I encourage Deputies to review the report of the implementation and oversight group tasked with implementing the recommendations of the PPRG.  These reports give a fair reflection of the awareness of the issues in my Department and show the body of work already done.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the interagency group on co-operation for a fairer and safer Ireland is due to submit its first report to me in the near future.  I am informed that the committee's report was raised at a recent meeting and will be discussed in more detail at the next meeting.  The interdepartmental group to examine issues with people with mental illness who come into contact with the criminal justice system will submit its second report to me in the coming weeks.  The recommendations of this report and the group's first report will then be considered.  I reiterate that reform takes commitment and resources and I assure Deputies of my commitment to that.  I am satisfied that some of the points made indicate that the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service are committed to continuing the progressive reform that has begun.<\/p><p>I will ensure the necessary resources are in place to match this commitment.  This can be seen in the recommencement of recruitment in the Irish Prison Service last year, when 85 new staff joined the service.  The new staff will ensure the service is renewed and have the capacity to continue to provide for safe and secure custody and rehabilitation in all prisons throughout the country.  Recruitment is continuing this year when it is anticipated approximately 200 further prison officers will be recruited.  <\/p> <p> I acknowledge the points made by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made about alternatives to prison and the need to ensure prisons are a place of last resort for the courts.  It is essential on every occasion that the courts have a menu of alternatives to placing people in custodial detention.  <\/p> <p> The report is informative, detailed and comprehensive.  It has many implications for the services involved in terms of policy, infrastructure, responsibilities and resources.  As such, I will need time to examine it thoroughly with my officials to ascertain how we might chart an avenue to make progress.  I assure the House, as we near the end of another D&aacute;il term, that I am very open to engaging with the Chairman of the committee on the report and the recommendations contained therein.  I trust that I will have an opportunity to do so in the early autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800043#UU00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530202500,"counter":317,"content":"<p>The Minister has acknowledged the work of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality in this area and confirmed that the report and its 29 recommendations are receiving his full attention and consideration.
