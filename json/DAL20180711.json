Joint research with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, shows that the overall macroeconomic impact would result in the level of gross domestic product being almost 4% below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario after ten years.  The level of employment in Ireland would be 2% lower with the unemployment rate nearly 2% higher.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the significant discontinuity and additional costs for businesses arising from the abrupt imposition of tariffs, there would be customs procedures and other non-tariff barriers.

Yes, I see the current situation where there is a significant shortfall versus supply.  If it were to continue in the future it would be a risk which is why we are taking steps to address it.  The reason for this is such a shortage would increase affordability pressures, would affect our competitiveness and would harm our ability to create and retain jobs, in addition to the significant social pressure and the huge damage it would cause to our society.  Due to the seriousness of the issue, housing supply is specifically listed as a domestic macroeconomic risk in the stability programme update.  As such, it is accorded the highest priority within my Department and in government more generally.<\/p>  <p>  In response to this challenge, and in addition to the measures implemented under Rebuilding Ireland, Budget 2018 contained a number of initiatives aimed at increasing supply.

My officials and I have been considering it.  First, I reject any assertion that Ireland is a tax haven.  The report to which the Deputy refers does not provide a definition of \"tax haven\" and appears to assert that Ireland and many others countries are tax havens without providing any rationale for the assertion.  In the report, the authors appear to use the terms \"low-tax countries\" and \"tax havens\" interchangeably.  The inference that Ireland is a tax haven simply because of its longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate is totally out of line with the long-established position that a low corporate tax rate applied to a wide tax base is good economic policy for attracting investment and supporting economic growth.  The central analysis of the paper looks at links between the level of profit booked and the level of wages paid in a country.  This creates the totally misleading impression that corporate profits are, or should be, linked directly to wage levels.  In reality, corporate profits are linked to the outputs of investment in all income-generating activities such as investment in research and development, intangible assets, capital intensive machinery and investment in staff.  A small country with high levels of high value-adding foreign direct investment relative to the size of the domestic economy will, of course, appear like an outlier in this type of analysis.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I am cognisant of the problem of aggressive tax planning by large multinational companies and recognise the need for effective solutions.  That is why Ireland is involved and participating fully in the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  Yesterday, the Government approved a memorandum on the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.  The convention provides a mechanism by which to implement the recommendations of the OECD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100006#D00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1531303200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Diarmaid Ferriter put it well in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>when he said that if the Department of Finance were to be believed, there must be an awful lot of eejits slaving away on academic research projects relating to tax.  The approach of the Department and the Government is simply to deny report after report based on facts which illustrate Ireland's role as a corporate tax haven.  Let us deal with the central proposition of the paper, which is the point about the ratio of profits to wages.  The report found that US companies in Ireland declared $8 of profit for every $1 spent on wages here.  That is 16 times the average rate among non-tax havens and 16 times the average among Irish companies in Ireland.  To put it simply, what explains the extraordinarily high levels of productivity of workers in the multinational sector in Ireland compared with workers in the indigenous sector?  Is it not the case that the only explanation for this relates to the shifting of intangible assets, etc., and the use of Ireland as a conduit tax haven?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100006#D00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1531303200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The explanation for that is the fact that we are either the first or second most globalised country and that the workers to whom the Deputy refers in those companies are part of global supply chains.

One of the reasons for that is the focus we have had on ensuring that companies make long-term commitments to Ireland.  We believe long-term commitment is facilitated and strengthened if it involves the location of manufacturing, intellectual property and a high number of jobs within our country.  That has led to long-term relationships between Ireland and many large multinational companies, which has been at the core of the economic transformation we have experienced.  Amid the Deputy's criticism, will he comment on the fact that we have 735 companies located in Dublin, attracted here by IDA Ireland, which employ 88,000 people?  I ask the Deputy to look at the Grange Castle Business Park near his own constituency and the companies located there which employ people as a consequence of the policies to attract investment to Ireland of which the Deputy is so critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100006#D00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1531303200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Butter would not melt in the Minister's mouth.

What that statistic reveals is the extent of corporate profit shifting being carried on through intellectual property and intangible assets.  Google paid corporate tax at a rate of 0.14% between 2005 and 2011, Starbucks paid &euro;45 in tax in 2015 and Apple Sales International paid tax at a rate of 0.005% in 2014.  Ireland is a driving factor of inequality around the world which means that 82% of the wealth generated internationally last year went to the richest 1%.  A key factor in that is corporate tax rates going, on average, from 49% in 1984 to 24% in 2018.

I asked the Deputy to acknowledge that, in Dublin alone, over 88,000 people are employed in the companies attracted by policies pursued here.<\/p>  <p>  The recent article by John FitzGerald in respect of this matter is very interesting.  While that article looked at issues around profit sharing and the movement of profit across the world, the Deputy underestimates in his analysis the effect of American corporate tax changes on the global tax playing field.  They will have a significant effect because they will change the incentives available to companies regarding where they locate profits and how they repatriate them.  As those changes happen, Ireland will continue to be competitive.  Much of the engagement I have had over the last number of weeks points to that.  However, those US policies mean the global tax environment is being changed.

Are they suggesting that any given budget would make no difference to tax rates?  If that is the case, we will have a tax code that gradually falls out of line with changes in people's incomes which in turn would create a long-term problem.  Those who suggest that I should do more are advocating the big-bang approach to taxation that was pursued in the past.  Look how that turned out.

The sanction for people who represent an exaggerated or fraudulent claim is a fine of &euro;100,000 or prison or both.  We do not need any more than that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100010#H01000","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531306200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>It is never acted upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100011#J00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1531306200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>It is never acted upon but what we want to do is put in place the pathway by which it will be acted upon<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100011#J00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Semester Process","time":1531306200,"counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100011#J00350"},{"type":"question","time":1531306200,"counter":98,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[30961\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100011#J00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way in which he will respond to the country-specific recommendations from the EU Commission.","asker":"1432","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","time":1531306200,"counter":99,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[30979\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100011#J00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the European Commission's country specific recommendations in relation to aggressive tax planning, pension reforms and healthcare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1531306200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>On 23 May 2018, the European Commission published recommendations on the 2018 national reform programme of Ireland and delivered a Council opinion on the stability programme of Ireland.

Similar to last year, Ireland received three recommendations.  The first deals with the effectiveness of public finances and expenditure, the reduction of Government debt and broadening the tax base.  The second references the implementation of the national development plan and the third addresses productivity growth and the resolution of long-term arrears.  <\/p>  <p>  These recommendations were based on the European Commission's country report for Ireland, which was published earlier in March.  At the June meeting of the Economic and Finance Affairs Council, my colleagues and I welcomed and approved the publication of the country-specific recommendations, which were subsequently endorsed by the European Council.  On Friday, 13 July, the country-specific recommendations will be adopted at the ECOFIN meeting that I will attend.  I will bear these recommendations in mind as part of the overall process when preparing budget 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Ireland did not receive a recommendation relating to aggressive tax planning, although it was referenced in the recitals to the country-specific recommendations.  We remain committed to implementing the OECD base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and the recommendations of the Coffey review of Ireland's corporation tax code.  <\/p>  <p>  Part of the country-specific recommendation dealing with the effectiveness of public finances aimed to address the expected increase in age-related expenditure by increasing the cost-effectiveness of the healthcare system and pursuing the envisaged pension reforms.  While healthcare policy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health, my Department works closely with the Department of Health on an ongoing basis.  The Departments have also worked closely on longer-term issues such the implementation of an agreement on prices of and access to medicines. <\/p>  <p>  Matters relating to pensions reform are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

I referred to how thousands of children and young people are on waiting lists to access psychiatrists and psychologists, as well as how many professionals in the service were finding it challenging, frustrating and disillusioning, that many brilliant people are leaving the service and how there is a collective feeling of frustration among many of those working in CAMHS.  The Taoiseach's response was complacent and revealed a certain lack of appreciation of the crisis in our mental health services across the board.<\/p><p>There has been a 10% increase in the number of children waiting to access CAMHS, with more than 2,500 children waiting.  There are 350 vulnerable young people waiting longer than 12 months for an appointment which is shameful given their vulnerability.  Outside CAMHS, more than 6,500 children were waiting for a primary care appointment in psychology in January 2018 with 1,700 waiting for a psychology appointment for more than a year. <\/p><p>Timely intervention is essential when dealing with vulnerable young people in such circumstances.  This is compounded by the 20% increase in the number of children admitted to adult wards.  Some 81 vulnerable young people last year spent more than 630 days in adult wards, which is a traumatic experience.  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, recently made a valuable presentation to the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care, outlining young people's experiences of our mental health services.  He consulted 25 young people who told of their experiences.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>Many of the young people concerned spoke about the length of time it took to access CAMHS and the stark differences in the availability and consistency of the service throughout the country.  They described these delays and inconsistencies as being very difficult.  They also referenced the distance between the inpatient units and their homes.<\/blockquote><p>He also referred to one young person who spoke of being placed in an adult psychiatric ward which was &quot;an experience he described as traumatic&quot;.<\/p><p>When one adds the problems in recruitment to mental health services, there are real issues.  Some 31% of psychiatry posts are either vacant or filled only temporarily and there are 500 vacancies in psychiatric nursing.  There are concerns for our mental health services.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there are major issues in mental health services particularly in access to CAMHS, that many young people are experiencing unacceptable delays in accessing these services and that there are major recruitment and retention issues for professional posts?  Will he consider expanding the National Treatment Purchase Fund to address gaps in our mental health services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100012#K00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1531306800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that I, as Taoiseach, and the Government are very much aware of the shortcomings in our mental services generally, and in CAMHS.  We all have constituency responsibilities and are aware of the cases that come into our offices of those waiting for the appointment to access to psychologist or specialist that they very much need.  I am also aware that people are increasingly willing to talk about, identify and deal with mental health.  It is a big change in our society in recent years, and a very welcome one.  There has been a big increase in demand for mental health services by adults and particularly by children.  It is not necessarily solely down to an increase in pathology or mental health problems; it is down to a willingness on the part of people to identify the problems they have, to talk about them and to seek help, which is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  On the progress we are making, funding for mental health services has increased considerably.  Since Fianna F&aacute;il left office in 2011, there has been an increase of &euro;200 million in the mental health budget.  It has increased from approximately &euro;700 million to &euro;910 million this year, and will increase again next year.  That is evidence of much taxpayers' money being invested in our mental health services.  In practice that means that we recruited an additional 114 assistant psychologists and 22 staff grade psychologists for primary care child psychology services.  Of the 114 assistant psychologists, 111 have been recruited and are now in post and of the 22 staff-grade psychologists, 20 are in post.  This is a good example of additional staff being recruited and our success in so doing.  It also involves a change in model.  Part of the current difficulty is that people are often referred to a specialist.  This is a problem across our health service, where a patient goes from a GP to a highly qualified specialist, often somebody with a PhD, when people have different needs at different levels and different referral pathways are needed.  The introduction of assistant psychologists is a good step forward in this. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is also prioritising a reduction in CAMHS waiting lists.  The total number of those waiting as of March was 2,691, which includes those waiting any length of time, from a long time to those who may have been waiting only a few weeks.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, in particular, has directed the HSE to introduce a 24-7 telephone helpline, to ensure better out-of-hours services, and is also piloting a telepsychiatry project in Donegal, which allows people to use modern technology to access the support they need.<\/p>  <p>  We are also working with Senator Joan Freeman.  I met her in the past couple of weeks to discuss her legislation, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016.  It will not outlaw children being looked after in adult units but will set out clear legal criteria for when it is permissible.  We are keen to work with her in getting that legislation done in the next session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100012#K00800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1531306800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Three weeks ago, two psychiatrists in the Waterford-Wexford area resigned their posts because they said services were falling apart.  I met the Taoiseach's predecessor over the past two years and we went through these issues, along with Deputy James Browne who has monitored the mental health commitments in the confidence and supply agreement.  The Taoiseach can quote figures about increased allocation because of demographics or whatever but too many young people are waiting too long to access services, and that is also true of too many children who are in difficult circumstances.  When I meet Ministers, they put their hands out and say, \"What can we do?  There has been a recruitment failure.\"  Some 44 consultant posts were advertised in psychiatry and no applications were received for 25% of them.<\/p><p>No applications were received for child and adolescent psychiatry positions in counties Sligo, Leitrim, Cork, Donegal, Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland will confirm that the recruitment and retention crisis is affecting services across the board.  The Government needs to realise that people are waiting too long and it needs to change tack.  Senator Freeman has been pursuing legislation for quite some time.  If the truth be told, she has been doing so uphill against the system.  Too many children and young people have been waiting for far too long.  They are suffering as a result.

That is true of child and adolescent mental health and of mental health more generally.  It is true of our health service generally.  The question is what we can do about it.  The first step is to provide additional resources, funding and staff.  We are using taxpayers' money to do that.  Since 2012, an additional 2,000 new mental health posts have been approved and 1,300 of them, or two thirds, have been filled.  That is an example of the recruitment that is happening.  Perhaps there is not as much recruitment as we need.  There have been big improvements in counselling services.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the Jigsaw service, which has been expanded.  I think everyone agrees that this service has brought about a real improvement in mental health services for young people, particularly because they can refer themselves to the service.  There are new Jigsaw sites in Cork, Limerick and Dublin, bringing the total number of sites to 13.  As the Deputy is aware, we have worked on legislation with Opposition Deputies and Senators, including Independents.  A Bill that was proposed by Deputy Browne became law within the past couple of months.  We were happy to co-operate with Fianna F&aacute;il to get that through.

Instead of pursuing a genuinely victim-centred approach, it has opted to manage and contain the matter.  An authentic approach would have put the affected women and their families first in a dedicated and comprehensive manner, rather than in a piecemeal way involving mere words, but that is certainly not happening.  Delay and obstruction have been the overriding themes of this scandal and of the Government's handling of this most serious matter.  Women are still being forced to go through the courts to access vital information from their medical records.  The essential review of 3,000 cervical smear slides has not yet begun.  In addition, the final report of the scoping investigation will be delayed.  It is important to remember that the scoping exercise was supposed to be a fast and sharp inquiry, mindful of the fact that many of the women in question will become very sick.  As we know, women have died.  Sadly, some women are now dying.  As recently as last Thursday, Fine Gael voted against a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill which sought to make open disclosure mandatory.  I think that says it all.  It says that the Government has not really prioritised this matter and does not really have a sense of the urgency that is required to deal with the issues being faced by these women and their families.  To add insult to injury, we understand from campaign groups that women are not being given full and complete information on how to access the &euro;2,000 assistance payment.  We are being told that women are being sent into an information cul-de-sac by the HSE and the Department of Health.  It has been reported today that only those expenses incurred since 11 May last can be recouped and recovered, which is crazy.  The Taoiseach might confirm whether this is true.  If it is true, it means that no account is being taken of the considerable expenses and loss of earnings incurred by some of the women who are at the centre of these cases.  Yesterday, I raised the imperative of establishing an independent patient advocacy group, specifically for these women and their families.  I am raising these issues again today because I am mindful that this is the last occasion on which the Taoiseach will take Leaders' Questions until September.  When will the review of the 3,000 smears begin?  When does the Taoiseach expect Dr. Scally to report?

This has been a difficult issue to deal with.  Like the women concerned, Deputy McDonald and everyone else, we did not have all the facts at the outset and we still do not have all the facts.  As we seek to deal with this matter, we are often having to change our response on a weekly basis because of the emergence of new facts and new information.  We set up the serious incident management team to go into CervicalCheck.  It was asked to put things in order and make sure records were provided to women and their solicitors as soon as possible.  We established the scoping inquiry and agreed the terms of reference with the Opposition.  That scoping inquiry is now under way.  Dr. Scally has already produced his first report, in which he recommended that better information be provided to women when they are going for smear tests in order that they understand the limitations of those tests.  A consent form which recognises that has already been done.  We expect further interim reports from Dr. Scally along the way, as soon as he is ready to give them to us.  He has said he is now content and satisfied with the information he is receiving from State authorities and the format in which it is being received.  We have asked him to contact the Minister for Health directly if he has any further difficulties.  As the inquiry is independent, it would be wrong for me to direct Dr. Scally to end it at a particular point.  We should allow him to carry out his independent inquiry as the whole point of an independent inquiry is that the Government does not interfere with it.  This inquiry is entirely independent.  Dr. Scally has told us he anticipates that he will have completed the report by the end of the summer.  We have already agreed that we will proceed to a commission of inquiry in September.  We know it will not be possible to answer all questions as a result of the scoping inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement of the Irish Medical Organisation is in place to give women who are concerned about previous smear tests the option of having repeat smear tests free of charge.  Many women have taken up that option.  I think it was right to offer this option.  A team from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Britain, with expert input from the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, has been appointed to review past smears.  This team has started its work.  It might not yet be examining slides but it is doing its preliminary work and terms of reference have been agreed.  We thought its work could be done much more quickly but the experts in the field are telling us it will take longer.  It will take up to four months.  We have put in place a comprehensive package of health and social care measures.  For example, over 400 medical cards have already been issued.  If Deputies know about individual cases in which people are having difficulties accessing the &euro;2,000 payment, they should pass on the details of those cases to me or to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and we will look into them.  According to the information we are getting from the HSE, difficulties are not being encountered.  We understand that many of those payments have been issued.  In some cases, there have been difficulties with getting people's bank details etc.  I ask Deputies to provide details of individual cases, if they have them, in order that we can follow them up.  It is true that it is not possible to claim for retrospective expenses.  Expenses can be claimed for going forward.  The issue of retrospective expenses will be dealt with in the individual settlements when the individual cases are sorted.  As we have said, mediation is on offer in all cases.  We cannot stop people going to court.  Everyone has the right to go to court if he or she wants to and believes it is in his or her best interests.  Mediation is being offered in all cases.

The Government should resource those carrying out the work so this can be achieved.  Members will know that the Scally team had great difficulty in accessing information from the HSE in the first instance.  I will not revisit all that.<\/p> <p> More importantly, I want the Taoiseach to indicate to the affected women when the 3,000 smear test slides will be examined.  When will the commission of inquiry be established?  Is it a certainty for September?  I want the Taoiseach to tell me what he is going to do about the fact that women still cannot gain access to their medical files.  I want him to state how it is defensible, given everything that has happened, that women are still forced into the courts to fight their corner to get their information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100013#L00500","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531308000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I cannot say for certain when the examination of the slides will commence.  I anticipate, however, that it will commence very soon.  The scoping and preliminary work done by the Royal College of Surgeons and the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology make certain suggestions - for example, that women should be asked for consent.  Things were not done properly in the past and we need to do them properly in the future.  In that context, it was suggested that if we are to examine women's slides again, they should be asked individually for their consent.  It should be borne in mind that it is not just a matter of reviewing their slides but also their entire medical records.  What we are seeking for women is not just an answer about their slides but also an answer as to the extent their treatment or prognosis might have been affected.  It is a bigger matter than two people just looking at a slide under a microscope.  It is probably important to engage women individually, seek their consent for the examination on an individual basis and make sure each woman is briefed and informed of the result of the audit.  It is a bigger job than we might have anticipated in May.<\/p>  <p>  The Scally inquiry is independent.  The Deputy may not intend to do so but I believe she is questioning its independence by asking the Government to set some sort of deadline.  We are not going to do that.  We are here to support the work of Dr. Scally.  We have asked him to have a sense of urgency in his work.  We said we will give him any support he needs.

It should be borne in mind there are different forms.  Some are paper and some are electronic.  It is not just patient files.  They are held in different places.

When will that be published?  Will the D&aacute;il get a chance to discuss it?<\/p>  <p>  Why was there no public competition for the position of Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality?  The latter is a key Department of Government.  Everybody believes that most government-related jobs should be filled through public competition.  Why was there no competition in this case?  The appointee, Mr. O'Driscoll, has a fine track record but we would have expected a public competition.<\/p>  <p>  The justice matter I particularly want to ask about is based on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, report on recorded crime in the year to the end of March 2018.  Many people find the contents very disturbing and disappointing.  The statistics show a general significant increase in crime across nearly all categories.  For example, sexual offences rose by almost 15%, to over 3,000.  Attempts of threats to murder, assault and harass were up nearly 14%, to over 19,000 crimes.  Robbery, extortion and hijacking rose by 16%, and theft and related offences were up 8%, to almost 70,000 crimes.  Damage to property rose by 5%, to over 23,000 offences.  Homicides show a decline in this period but, of course, the statistics do not include the terrible second quarter of 2018 in which there seemed to have been an appalling homicide almost every second day.<\/p>  <p>  These figures are published by the CSO as statistics under reservation due to ongoing concerns about the quality of data from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's PULSE database.  What steps is the Taoiseach taking to address this very worrying increase in crime during his period in office and when will the CSO be in a position to publish regular crime statistics without qualification?<\/p>  <p>  These shocking crime statistics are echoed in episodes of appalling antisocial and criminal behaviour in districts of my constituency and the north division of the Garda Dublin metropolitan region.  During the Taoiseach's period in office, there has been a significant upsurge in antisocial behaviour, thefts, intimidation, harassment, joyriding and serious drug-related crimes.  I have in front of me a petition from 200 residents from a district of the north fringe of Dublin city who are complaining bitterly about the recent spate of thefts of cars, motorbikes and bicycles from their new homes.  They are demanding a permanent Garda presence in this vast, new urban district.<\/p>  <p>  In the period to mid-2014, when the Taoiseach was a Minister, the then Government decimated Garda numbers.  Every time our local Garda personnel respond - under Chief Superintendent Curran and his officers in the north division of the Dublin metropolitan region - they outline their policing plans but they talk about very tight budgets and the problem of the reducing number of personnel in several districts.  The Taoiseach will probably respond with the mantra about having 21,000 Garda personnel by 2021 but there have been no staff increases in the north division of the Dublin metropolitan region, only cuts.  There is a report in the media that overtime budgets are being cut by up to 40%.  Can the Taoiseach confirm whether this is the case and whether the Garda budget of &euro;1.65 billion for 2018 is adequate?<\/p>  <p>  There has been a generally positive welcome for the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner, Mr. Drew Harris.  I welcome his appointment.  Will the Taoiseach give him the resources and tools to transform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from September and to deal with the growing lawlessness that has been a feature of the Taoiseach's period in office?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100014#M00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1531308000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and his group for the report provided to the Government.  We approved it yesterday.  It builds on the Toland report and sets out an 18-month timeframe during which the Department of Justice and Equality is to be reformed.  It involves dividing the Department into two divisions, one with responsibility for home affairs and the other with responsibility for justice and law reform, with a deputy secretary general heading each and with Civil Service programme managers in the Department to ensure that the Minister's office is kept fully abreast of what is happening in those areas.  Quite radically, it involves a real change across the Department, breaking up the work into areas such as policy, operations and legislation.  This is very different from the silos we typically have in Departments whereby everything is broken up by policy area.  Within each policy area, the person in charge is supposed to be responsible for everything, from legislation and communications to parliamentary questions and policy documents.  If what is proposed works, it could be a very good model for the modernisation and reform of other Departments.  Let us see whether it works in this Department first.<\/p>  <p>  There is no requirement that all Secretary General positions be open to public competition.  On this occasion, we took the view that it was important that the person who became Secretary General had experience of being the Secretary General of a Department.  It is, therefore, essentially a promotion.  It involves somebody moving up from being a Secretary General in an important but relatively small Department to being a Secretary General in a much more challenging and complex Department.  It is a matter of promotion rather than open competition.  The post of Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is being vacated as a result of the promotion, will be open to full competition.  That decision was made yesterday also.<\/p>  <p>  On tackling crime, there are many things the Government can do and is doing - never mind our target for the future.  Since the end of 2016, the number of members of the Garda force has increased by 600 and recruitment continues.  We are investing in new Garda stations - modern stations - like the one that can be seen in Kevin Street and the one in Sligo, in addition to some others that are very much going ahead.  There is also investment in Garda ICT and vehicles.  The current budget for the Garda is unprecedented, amounting to &euro;1.6 billion.  It is an enormous budget.<\/p>  <p>  Once again, I have to say to the Deputy - I know he does not accept this - that it is about more than resources.  If one wants public services to function well, staff and resources are only part of the picture.  Reform is needed.  One needs to make sure the resources and staff are deployed in the best interest of those who pay for them and those who use and need to the services.  That has not always been the case.  It will be very much part of the role of the new Commissioner and his team to ensure that staff and resources are deployed in the interest of the taxpayers who pay for them and the citizens who need them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100014#M00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1531308000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>When the Taoiseach is walking around the country and when we are walking around constituencies, the one thing that always sticks in one's mind when crime and bad antisocial behaviour are raised, as happens regularly, is that people want to see garda&iacute; - male and female - on the streets.<\/p><p>The visibility of garda&iacute; is missing, and that is a key problem.  It is about resources, numbers, particularly on the front line.  That must be addressed.  We also must have a full discussion of the O'R&iacute;ord&aacute;in report because apparently it makes important points about accountability and the fact that there is no central accountability in the Department of Justice and Equality.  Civil servants and garda&iacute; sometimes have ended up in the same trench together.  Garda Commissioner Harris must get rid of that mindset.<\/p> <p> I wish to make two final points.  Emily Logan, Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, recently drew attention to the Lifecycle of a Hate Crime: Country Report for Ireland and said that we are deficient in responding to hate crime.  Is that at the top of the Government's agenda for legislation given that she said legislation is required?

We are increasing Garda numbers and we have 600 more garda&iacute; now than two years ago.  More are being recruited all the time and that will facilitate greater visibility.  However, it is not just about staff and resources.  Things can be done with existing staff levels to increase visibility, such as greater civilianisation.  Many garda&iacute; are not out in public where people can see them because they are behind desks and in offices and that has to change.  We will need co-operation from the Garda Representative Association and others with regard to civilianisation.<\/p>  <p>  Second, we will need changes in rostering.  Garda&iacute; are often not rostered when they are needed, something that can happen in the health service too.  There might be many people on duty when it is relatively busy but when it is extremely busy there are not so many people on duty.  That may mean asking people to work rosters that they consider to be anti-social, but if we care about society we must have staff in the Garda, the health service and in other areas rostered on duty when society needs them.

My constituency colleagues and I have raised this matter on a number of occasions since the closure of St. Michael's acute psychiatric unit in Clonmel.  There are now no inpatient psychiatric beds in north or south Tipperary.  Patients in north Tipperary, which was in the old Mid-Western Health Board area, must attend the unit in Ennis while those in south Tipperary, which was in the old South Eastern Health Board area, have to attend the unit in Kilkenny.  Both units are overcrowded and substandard and are simply not providing a service for patients from Tipperary.  Admissions to the units are being delayed and when patients from Tipperary are admitted they are discharged, inappropriately I believe, ahead of time.  There is no consistent follow-up of the patients and it is difficult, if not impossible, for their relatives and friends to support these patients in Kilkenny or Ennis.  It is difficult to travel to support family members.  Families have been contacting me and other representatives about this issue for some time.<\/p>  <p>  Inpatient psychiatric beds must be provided in Tipperary.  We need a seamless service not just in one area but across all areas.  There must be a community-based service along with inpatient services.

There has been a significant increase in the number of suicides in the county since the closure of these beds and a number of organisations are demanding that they be reopened.  Tipperary's Fight for Mental Health Services has organised many meetings and protests and the Save Our Acute Hospital Services Committee has been in discussions about this with the Minister and the HSE in the south east.

He has raised overcrowding in the hospital in Clonmel on many occasions, and we are making good progress on that, as well as on the mental health services.  The move in mental health over the past couple of decades, in line with A Vision for Change which every party has signed up to, is to move away from the residential and institutional model of providing mental health and psychiatric care towards one that is based in the community.  Twenty and 30 years ago huge numbers of people were treated in psychiatric hospitals.  Over the intervening years we have tried to do two things - to get rid of psychiatric hospitals and move those people into mainstream health care, because mental health is mainstream health care and should never have been treated as something separate, and to reduce the number of people receiving the mental health services they need in a residential setting and move them to a community setting.  Most people who have mental health problems do not need to be in hospital.  They need treatment and they can get that in the community and stay in their homes.  That has been the direction of travel and, broadly, it has been the correct one.<\/p>  <p>  However, on occasion people need to be admitted so we need a certain number of inpatient hospital beds.  I am advised that in the south east there is planning permission for, and construction is beginning on, a crisis house for the region.

This would initially be on a voluntary basis.  This type of reporting is a key recommendation of the climate task force of the financial stability board.  Other European nations have begun climate change reporting.  UK regulations make it mandatory for companies listed on the UK stock exchange to include full details of their carbon emissions.  Companies must also disclose their environmental and social governance.  In 2015, the French Government passed a law requiring greater disclosure by companies of climate-related risks and, indeed, opportunities.  This includes reporting on financial risks related to the effects of climate change, the consequences of climate change and how the company does business, etc.<\/p><p>There are significant benefits to beginning this process as markets function best with complete or near-complete information.  As the risks of climate change grow, governmental and legal responses to climate change become a more pertinent factor for companies.  Additional guidelines for companies on how to assess their exposure to climate change risks provide them with a more complete picture of their market risks and opportunities.  From a mitigation point of view, it is important that actors at all levels of society seek to integrate the cost of carbon emissions and climate-related risks into the decision-making process.  I look forward to having a first reading of a Bill to do that in the House in due course.<\/p><p>A new study identifies Ireland as the worst-performing country in Europe when it comes to taking action to combat climate change.  The State has fallen 28 places to 49th out of 56 countries ranked in the 2018 climate change performance index, which is a holistic evaluation of how countries are responding to challenges of decarbonisation.  In 2016, the latest year for which we have numbers, our greenhouse gas emissions increased by 3.6% and we recorded increases across all the main sectors of the economy.  Work done by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland,SEAI, estimates that Ireland will be liable for fines of between &euro;130 million and &euro;390 million for missing its renewable energy targets.  All this is happening at a time there is a stronger appetite than ever on the part of the public and key stakeholders to take carbon out of our economy.  The recent Citizens' Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of strong action on the climate and a growing number of companies want to power their offices and data centres on renewable energy alone.<\/p><p>On the day he was appointed or soon after, the Taoiseach indicated that climate action was an issue he would take seriously as he appointed Ministers to his Government but we have seen little or no action from him in this area over the past 12 months.  The forthcoming budget will provide an appropriate opportunity to show whether the Government is serious about this issue.  It is clear that we will significantly miss the targets in the Paris agreement for 2020 and much of the Government talk is now about 2030 and 2050, in the full knowledge that it will go well beyond the electoral cycle in which large numbers of current Members will be able to participate.  That is not good enough and it is about time the Government stepped up to the plate to ensure we play our part in protecting and preserving our climate.  I hope this Bill can be on the Statute Book in the not-to-distant future and certainly in the next session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100019#R01500","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100019#R01600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100019#R01700","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531311000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100019#R01900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100019#R02000","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531311000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Assaults on Older Persons Bill 2018: First Stage","time":1531311000,"counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100019#R02200"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to revise the law relating to the main non-fatal offences against the person and to provide for connected matters.<\/blockquote><p>The aim of this Bill is to help and protect older people from assaults and to toughen sentences on people convicted of assaulting an older person.  A series of high-profile incidents over the past number of years underlines the need to have strong protections and to deter offenders.  The Bill sets out a mandatory sentence of three years, which will send a clear message that certain crimes will not be tolerated and ensure clear, transparent and consistent sentencing for such heinous assaults.<\/p><p>In Ireland, assaults against older people are dealt with under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  In sentencing someone who has been found guilty of assault, a judge may consider the seriousness of the offence, a guilty plea and any mitigating factors.  As in other countries, the age of the victim may be considered an aggravating factor when it comes to sentencing.<\/p><p>This Bill strengthens penalties for such attacks and it sets out mandatory sentencing of a minimum of three years for anyone convicted of such an attack.  This recognises the severe impact such incidents have on older people, both physically and psychologically, across the broader community.  The psychological impact and fear of such attacks, while rare, mean that legislation is necessary to assure older people that we will fully defend them.<\/p><p>The Bill is short and deals with offences against persons aged over 65.  The act applies to an assault causing harm to an older person, a threat to kill or cause serious harm to an older person and injury of an older person caused by the piercing of the skin of that elderly person with a syringe.  If a person is convicted of such an offence, the court shall in passing sentence give a minimum period of imprisonment of not less than three years.  This will not apply if the court is satisfied that there are exceptional or specific circumstances relating to the offence or the person related to that offence.<\/p><p>The Bill draws on precedent in the USA and is designed to send a clear message to thugs and criminals who terrify older people that this type of heinous behaviour will not be tolerated.<\/p><p>There is also evidence that older people are more prone to psychological trauma after experiencing crime.  As noted in a 2014 publication by the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland, when a crime is committed against a person aged over 60 research shows that he or she might be less well able to recover psychologically than if he or she was at an earlier point in his or her life.  The fear of crime can also be damaging to the well-being of the older person because it can alter his or her state of mind and level of social interaction.<\/p> <p> We have seen horrific incidences of older people being attacked in their own homes by marauding burglars.  It is now a common occurrence in our country for older men and women to be attacked and held hostage while their homes are ransacked.  Garda sources say that even those victims subjected to more minor assaults, or in some cases extreme verbal threats, find it difficult to feel safe in their homes again and in some instances they never go back to living alone again.  These are terrible crimes that scar people and their families.  It creates fear in communities that is hard to shake and get over.  I look forward to working with other parties and the Government to advance this legislation and put in place the protections older people deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100019#R02300","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S00500","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Dublin (North Inner City) Development Authority Bill 2018: First Stage","time":1531311600,"counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision for the regeneration of the area of Dublin's north inner city and for that purpose to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the Dublin Inner City Development Authority to oversee said regeneration, to define the functions of said body and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>I wish to acknowledge the commitment and time that iar-Thaoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, invested in the north inner city area of Dublin since a gang war erupted in the area in mid 2016.  Dublin north inner city belongs to the local community but it is also part of the cultural narrative of Ireland as a whole.  This Bill is to demonstrate a long-term commitment to Dublin north inner city, so the Bill goes beyond transient political interests in the heart of our capital city.<\/p><p>Dublin north inner city has enormous cultural and historical riches and potential, but it remains plagued with dereliction and the social fabric of the area continues to decline and degenerate.  If passed, this Bill will demonstrate the commitment of the State to a lasting commitment to a community in our capital city as opposed to particular individuals.  When the gangland feud erupted two years ago, the Government committed to regenerating the north inner city and on foot of that commitment it established the north inner city task force under Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  We welcomed that at the time.<\/p><p>Its essential weakness, however, was that it had no statutory footing.  There is no guarantee that commitment made two years ago will endure, that the interest will last or it will transcend public relations exercises.  We have a strong conviction on this side of the House that there has to be a long-term commitment, ten years in the case of this Bill, by the State.  Like my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, I met with the north inner city coalition groups.  They have been working for decades and would benefit greatly from the support of a statutory body or agency as opposed to a passing fad or phase of interest.<\/p><p>North inner city communities agree that what they need is an agency to help them tackle the root cause of poverty and the inability of young people to advance and achieve their true potential.  Some of them succumb, despite their own best efforts and the efforts of the many amazingly supportive community groups and services, to the tantalising allure of the diversion and distraction of drugs and crime.  To those suspicious of the timing of this Bill, I point out that at the time the gangland feuds were at their peak and responses were being formulated, my party colleague in the area, Ms Mary Fitzpatrick, in a written submission in 2016, suggested such a statutory body to act as a catalyst and reliable long-term bulwark for efforts in the north inner city to ensure long-term commitment and to have real powers and authority to guarantee that what needs to happen would actually happen.<\/p><p>There are enormous areas of potential within this historic part of contemporary Dublin and the authority proposed in this Bill, if enacted, would guarantee that every effort would be made to maximise and develop the full potential of the community.  My party has a strong record of facilitating such regeneration in the heart of our capital.  The Grangegorman campus for example, once a 70 acre piece of derelict inner city Dublin, has been utterly transformed under the powers of an authority into a high technology university campus in the heart of the capital.  It has been done before.  In introducing this Bill though, I am mindful that Dublin north inner city is not an isolated example of where regeneration and support is badly needed.  Parts of my constituency and neighbouring constituencies have been truly ignored by this and the previous Government: it is almost like they do not exist.<\/p><p>The publication, for example, in January of this year of the investment of RAPID programme monies bears testimony to this.  In 2017, the total funding allocation for RAPID was &euro;5 million.  From that, each of 31 local authorities received an allocation of &euro;64,500 but &euro;2.5 million was ringfenced for Dublin's north inner city.  The budget available in 2018 has shrunk to &euro;2 million.  The Government is storing up trouble ahead in these areas of disadvantage.  The challenges facing Dublin's north inner city are not isolated and it is its historical and cultural setting that sets it apart.  Real measures, however, are needed now.  What I am proposing will be needed to tackle the challenges facing communities in Jobstown, Killinarden and parts of north Clondalkin, represented by my colleague, Deputy John Curran.  I invite colleagues to read the Bill, to engage positively and constructively in it as it comes, if it comes, and progresses before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S00800","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Is this Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S01000","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S01100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S01200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S01225","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of D\u00e1il","time":1531311600,"counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S01250"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, has a business proposal to put to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531311600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm go bhfuil orm cur isteach ar an Teach chun an sceideal a athr&uacute;.

He was accompanied by Commissioner Hogan and Mr. Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s chief Brexit negotiator.<\/p>  <p>  At our meeting, we discussed the state of play in the Brexit negotiations in advance of the June European Council.  Mr. Barnier reiterated his assessment that serious divergences remain between the EU and the UK on how to resolve the Irish Border question.  As the EU side has made clear, the withdrawal agreement must contain a fully operational backstop so there can be no hard border on this island in the future, whatever circumstances may prevail.  For there to be a withdrawal agreement and a period of transition there has to be full agreement on all issues.  As we both made clear, there is now an urgent need to intensify efforts if we are to conclude a withdrawal agreement and have it operational by the time the United Kingdom leaves the EU next March.<\/p>  <p>  I, of course, took the opportunity to convey my sincere appreciation to both President Juncker and Mr. Michel Barnier for their unwavering support and solidarity throughout the negotiations, as the President reiterated when he spoke in this Chamber.  It is clear that EU partners remain absolutely steadfast in their support around the Irish issues.  We also discussed a number of other important EU issues ahead of the June European Council, including migration.  While noting Ireland was less directly affected than other member states, I made clear our wish to play our part in developing a comprehensive EU approach, based on ensuring strong external borders; solidarity between member states; and working in partnership with countries of origin, particularly African countries, to underpin political and economic development in those countries, so that people can enjoy better lives and opportunities in their home countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100020#S02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1531312200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Has the Taoiseach spoken to the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, since the three-page Chequers statement was published by the UK Government?

The Chequers agreement - if it can be called an agreement - between those members of the British Conservative Party present at Chequers on Friday, which is the document before us, speaks of an agreement that the UK would stay in a goods and agrifood market but not the full Single Market.  Is the Taoiseach of the view that there is scope to negotiate that matter, or is his statement of Monday that the UK is either in the Single Market as we know it in its entirety or out of it in its entirety his definitive view?  Most of us welcome the fact that there now  is at least a grounding document which we can engage with, but I am still of the view I expressed yesterday - and I thank the Taoiseach for his positive consideration of it - that we need a legal text covering the backstop agreement that is acceptable so that when we go into the October discussions we are not bundling everything together.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Taoiseach given further consideration to the notion of seeking to extricate the backstop agreement even if he needs to placate the UK authorities by saying that this is ar eagla na heagla, a complete backstop which probably will not be needed, but we need legal certainty around its terms which are agreeable to the UK?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100021#T00100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1531312200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>The pace of developments on Brexit has increased.

We require further elaboration and clarification in the context of the Chequers statement, which, as I said yesterday, represents a significant change in direction insofar as there is now coherence emanating from the British Government, and a clear move towards a softer Brexit.  The type of Brexit now being mooted is still unclear.  The exact end state sought by the Government has been entirely unclear over the past year beyond saying it wishes Britain to stay in everything.  Britain has said that it is not in favour of a Norway-style agreement but rather is seeking something more than just a free trade agreement.  Has the Taoiseach a position on that?  Yesterday he made comments about compromises on red line issues.  Can he be more specific about what he meant by that?  He seems to suggest that on one level the EU should be flexible on the red line issues but at the same time it is not compromising on them.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will also have noted that Mr. Michel Barnier has called for the issue of east-west controls under a backstop to be de-dramatised.  Many people see this as an admission that the impact of the backstop was over-briefed last December and that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste went overboard promoting it as an historic moment.  I note that the T&aacute;naiste seems to have taken a more nuanced approach and used a different tack to the Taoiseach regarding the Chequers statement.

None of us wants an east-west border, and certainly not a north-south border, but this is the hand we have been dealt; it is not of our making.  Does the Taoiseach share the view of Michel Barnier that the Single Market cannot be cherry-picked?  The four freedoms exist and the integrity of the market must be respected in its totality.  Is the Taoiseach<i>ad idem<\/i>with Mr. Barnier on that point?  I ask that question in the full knowledge that there is a necessity for a bespoke arrangement for the island of Ireland, and that our European partners are prepared to extend that or to depart marginally from that principle to accommodate Ireland.  I assume that we will continue to press for that.<\/p><p>Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach about the backstop, which was politically conceived in December and which found expression in March.  I require clarification on one aspect of his response.  He said that negotiations were still open.  My clear understanding is that the European text, that iteration of the backstop, is not still a matter for negotiations and that it is the European position.  Can the Taoiseach please confirm that is the case?  Can he also confirm that it is not just the European answer at this juncture, but that it is the backstop, as far as Ireland is concerned, at the moment?  <\/p><p>The Taoiseach said that he was not hung up on legal text, and that it is about the outcome rather than the legal text.

I want to interrogate what he is talking about and what it means.  I will put it bluntly and dramatically, and also accurately.  European leaders, including the Taoiseach, unfortunately, are sleep-walking back into the nightmare years of the 1930s, with the rise of the far-right and dangerous, racist political forces.  The Taoiseach was criticised over the weekend for what was described as a legitimising and normalising of the racist policies of the far-right Hungarian leader, Viktor Orb&aacute;n, by the Helsinki committee on human rights, for his evasive and weak responses, and for legitimising the quite shocking calls by Mr. Orb&aacute;n to put Hungarians first at the expense of refugees.  This sort of policy has led to the deaths of 35,000 people in the Mediterranean Sea and is leading to absolute horrors in places such as Libya, where people are experiencing slave-like conditions.  Is the Taoiseach worried about the rise of these far-right forces?  Have he and Mr. Juncker begun to question whether giving credence to the far right argument that asylum seekers are somehow a problem legitimises those forces and encourages them?  We should face them down in the strongest terms, and point out that asylum seekers and migrants are not a burden on Europe.  In Ireland we now have labour shortages.  We cannot build enough houses because we have labour shortages.  We should resolutely resist the racist, xenophobic, anti-migrant logic being pursued by Mr. Orb&aacute;n, who is a colleague of the Taoiseach in the European People's Party, EPP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100021#T00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1531312200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>From the top, I have not spoken to President Juncker since the Chequers statement was issued.

Consequently, I would like to see, read and digest that before speaking to Prime Minister May and President Juncker again.  However, I do anticipate that we will speak this month.  <br\/><br\/>In regard to the European Single Market, the position of the European Union and the 27 member states that are remaining, including Ireland, is that the four freedoms are invisible, that is, the freedom of goods, freedom of services, freedom of labour and freedom of capital.  It is not possible to cherry-pick and it would not be fair to other countries to allow any country to cherry-pick.  I imagine if the United Kingdom was allowed to have <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>membership of the Single European Market, far-right, far-left and populist parties all over the EU would demand the same for those countries, and we would begin to see the breakup of the Single Market and the European Union.

Any concessions or modification of the EU's position has to be done by the EU 27 acting together, and I cannot do that unilaterally.  However, I stand over what I have said consistently, namely, that if the United Kingdom evolves from its red lines, which subject to the White Paper following through on what was said at Chequers I believe it has, then the European Union can be flexible about its guidelines.  However, that change cannot be made by me.  It has to be made by the EU 27 working together, and I am absolutely determined that we should continue to be part of team Europe and part of the EU 27.  It is a strength in these negotiations that we are negotiating with the UK as Europe and that Ireland has not been isolated from other European countries or caught in the middle.  I think that is the way we can get the best deal for Ireland and Northern Ireland.  If things did go wrong for some reason and we did end up with a hard Brexit, a no-deal scenario, we would be better off with that being a shared problem for the EU 27 rather than with us going out on our own, having an independent position but at the end of it all looking for support and concessions from the EU, having broken the 27-member state consensus.

For many of those who took part, this will be a life-changing experience, working and training side by side with people from other nationalities, breaking down barriers and overcoming fears.  It opens up a world of possibilities for many and this is what the north-east inner city programme is all about - new opportunities and equality of opportunity. <\/p>  <p>  The board is working with Dublin City Council to ensure the look and feel of the area is improved through refurbishment and cleaning works, greening the area and tackling derelict sites. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to support Mr. Michael Stone and the board in the work they are doing, which is seeing good collaboration between State services, community projects and local employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100022#U01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1531312800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I wish to ask some precise questions.  I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive answer.  He says that the implementation board, chaired by Mr. Stone, meets monthly and reports to the senior officials group chaired by his own Secretary General.  In regard to capital projects, what are the Taoiseach's priorities now?  Very welcome work is now finally being done on O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens.  However, a lot of student accommodation has been built in the area.  What is the Taoiseach's view on the optimum balance between student and social and affordable housing and what social and affordable housing plans are afoot?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned the drugs task force.  I believe the deadline for submissions to the ongoing public consultation process on the personal possession of illegal drugs is Friday.  There is a lot of online advertising announcing that.  What is the Taoiseach's personal position on the possession of drugs for personal use or does he have one? <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Taoiseach mentioned the issue of community safety and extra garda&iacute;.

It was quite bizarre, and it was lucky happenstance that the person who came across the loaded Garda submachine gun was a responsible citizen who brought it to Store Street Garda station.  Does the Taoiseach have any information that would be of some assistance on that, even an initial assessment?<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Michael Stone has done good work, and he should be commended, as indeed should those on the various working groups.  Despite that, there is a mountain to climb.  Let me demonstrate what I mean by that.  The assistant Garda commissioner, Mr. Pat Leahy, revealed that more than 500 death threats have been issued to individuals across Dublin in recent years.  Of the most serious of these threats, ten were made against persons in the north inner city, many of them, though not all, related to the ongoing feud.  I will tell the Taoiseach that elderly people are frightened in many of our neighbourhoods.  Children in the neighbourhoods have been exposed to terrible violence, some of them having witnessed murder in broad daylight. <\/p><p>There is a concern among the schools to support these children through the trauma and impact of all of this.  I quoted the assistant commissioner, and I reiterate that it is his view that this feud, as it is called, is not likely to end any time soon.  As welcome as the funding has been for the north inner city, it has been piecemeal and, to use the old expression, been like using a Band-Aid where radical surgery is required.  At the root of all these issues, however we come at them, is poverty.  With regard to the issue of housing, I acknowledge the sod has been turned, at last, on O'Devaney Gardens in the north west of the inner city, which is not covered by this forum or working group.  If the Taoiseach wants to make a big difference, big money should be spent on the regeneration of Ballybough House, where people live in cramped, damp conditions in which nobody should be asked to live.  They are great families and great children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100022#U01800","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>The Deputy is over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>They are such cramped conditions, and the Ceann Comhairle will be shocked that people do not even have the space for a kitchen table.

It would be remiss of me, however, if I did not call on the Taoiseach to expand this positive engagement of the forum to date to the stakeholders in Ballymun and Finglas on the northside of the city.  Recently, the Taoiseach visited Ballymun with me and saw first-hand some of the great work taking place there.  Unfortunately, in parts of the Ballymun and parts of Finglas there is a serious issue with crime such as drug dealing, the illegal use of scrambler bikes and antisocial behaviour.  People are truly at their wits' end and I ask the Taoiseach to investigate the possibility of setting up a similar task force for Ballymun and Finglas, using the model quite successfully piloted in the north inner city to date, having been requested two years ago by the Taoiseach's predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, and working with the hard-working community activists, project leaders and groups in these areas.  In the two years since the task force was set up we have seen the difference it can make, the change it can bring about and the sustained focus it can place on a community such as the north inner city.  The changes have been positive so far and I would like the model to be expanded and brought to other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V00400","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>During his visit to Sheriff Street with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, last February, the Taoiseach stated the Departments based in the area needed to do more as members of the local community.

How many local people have been hired as a result of his commitment?  When we discussed the task force on the previous occasion, I identified housing as a key issue and I agree with Deputy McDonald.  I have been with Mary Fitzpatrick on a tour of the area.  The quality of housing is a key issue and there is a big gap in the initiative's focus.  The need to have a substantive regeneration project similar to Limerick and other areas is a key ingredient in terms of generational change.<\/p>  <p>  The quality of housing in which people are living is appalling in many instances, and there are also empty flats and complexes that have not been developed.  One of the big issues going forward will be the inability of people living in the community to have sustainable housing in terms of owning their own houses and retaining and sustaining a community spirit.  The biggest developments are in student accommodation and there is a danger of a change in terms of the living environment for many people.  Housing is something that needs to be focused on in this area, and there has been a gap in terms of the assessment of the issue, apart from other positives in terms of Garda activity, which I commend.

It has knock-on effects for children, mothers and everybody that then spill out into the other problems we often associate with extreme disadvantage.  The need to address this is of the utmost priority.<\/p>  <p>  My next point links to the questions on the European Union.

I do not know whether this is on the radar of the EU, in terms of the urgency of us looking for flexibility on the fiscal rules to put major investment into the provision of social, affordable and quality housing in the many areas where it is lacking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I will go to the Taoiseach now because there are only two minutes in which to respond to this group of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V00800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I am not a member of the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform, but a bit longer for me to answer the questions and a bit less time for them to be asked might be a solution, but if that is not possible I understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V00900","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>We only get a minute and a half.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V01000","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>We get 90 seconds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V01100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>They are meant to be questions and not lengthy statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V01200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531313400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I was asked about the priorities in terms of capital projects.  The priorities are Fitzgibbon Street Garda station and Rutland Street school.  With regard to Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, &euro;3 million has been approved for enabling works and the Garda and the OPW continue to engage closely to finalise the details on the accommodation brief.  A design team has been appointed and enabling works are expected to commence in the next couple of weeks.  The process of selecting contractors will commence this month.  On Rutland Street, following the completion of &euro;200,000 survey work in 2017, a design team was appointed by the city council.  That is at feasibility stage and work to explore design options.  A process of engagement is under way with existing user groups to scope out space requirement for the new facility.<\/p>  <p>  The city council is also engaging with the community and local councillors on the sale and redevelopment of the convent lands at the former Magdalen laundry on Sean McDermott Street.  The proposed plans are for a hotel on the site as well as housing units, which could be designated for older people, and would bring much needed investment, footfall and local employment to the area.  The council is also in discussions with groups on ensuring the development accommodates a suitable memorial to the Magdalen women.  Ultimately, this will be a decision for the council, which will vote on whether to proceed.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked about housing.  I am informed a number of housing bodies, in partnership with the city council, are working to deliver four main regeneration schemes in the north-east inner city area.  These are 80 units at a cost of &euro;21 million to refurbish St. Mary's Mansions flat complex by Cl&uacute;id Housing, and this project is now at demolition phase and will be completed in August next year; 72 units at Croke Villas, with the majority of works expected to be completed by the end of this year; 47 apartments by Circle Voluntary Housing Association, for which planning permission is expected at the end of this year with construction to be completed by the middle of 2021; and 29 older persons unit by Oaklee housing association, where works have already commenced on the site and the expected handover will be at the end of next year.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked about student accommodation.  Student accommodation is popping up all over the city, not just in the north-east inner city but also around the Tenters, Portobello and those parts of the city.  On balance it is needed and on balance it is welcome, but I understand local residents have concerns.  I remember when Trinity Hall was being extended in Dartry there were concerns from residents about too many students in the area, traffic, antisocial behaviour and various other issues.  Ultimately it worked out well and no one in Dartry would like to see Trinity Hall removed.  Those concerns can be overcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100023#V01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","time":1531314000,"counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100024#W00100"},{"type":"question","time":1531314000,"counter":297,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[27688\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100024#W00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the European Union leaders he spoke with prior to the June 2018 EU Council meeting.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1531314000,"counter":298,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[28848\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100024#W00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the European Union leaders he spoke with prior to the June 2018 EU Council meeting.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1531314000,"counter":299,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[29282\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100024#W00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his attendance at the European Council on 28 and 29 June 2018.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1531314000,"counter":300,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[29283\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100024#W00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagement with the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1531314000,"counter":301,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[29285\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100024#W00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the European Union member state Heads of State or Government he spoke with prior to the June 2018 European Council meeting.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1531314000,"counter":302,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[29291\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100024#W00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his attendance at the European Union Council;

I report to the House regularly on these engagements.  Recent formal bilateral meetings included those with the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Charles Michel, in Dublin on 24 May; the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Pedro S&aacute;nchez, in Madrid on 14 June; and Austrian Chancellor Kurz in Dublin last Sunday.  I also met the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, and the chief EU Brexit negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, in Dublin on 21 June.  I had a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May on the margins of the European Council on 28 June, where we discussed the Brexit negotiations and the position in Northern Ireland.  I also spoke with her by phone last Saturday.<\/p>  <p>  I had a telephone conversation with the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, ahead of the European Council, when we discussed the agenda for the meeting.  I outlined our intention to continue to play a constructive role in EU discussions on migration.  On Brexit, President Tusk expressed his disappointment at the lack of progress in the negotiations and reiterated his strong support for ensuring that the commitments agreed in December, including around the backstop, are translated into legal text in the withdrawal agreement.<\/p>  <p>  As I reported to the House in detail on 4 July, I attended the European Council in Brussels on Thursday, 28 June, and Friday, 29 June.  I also met informally with a number of my other EU counterparts, including the new Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Giuseppe Conte, and the Spanish and Portuguese Prime Ministers.  On 28 June, the European Council met in regular format to discuss migration, security and defence, relations with Russia, the multi-annual financial framework and a number of economic issues including the country-specific recommendations on trade, taxation, digital and innovation.  On Friday morning, we met in Article 50 format to discuss the Brexit negotiations and later on Friday, we held euro summit in inclusive format to exchange views on how we can deepen and improve economic and monetary union.<\/p>  <p>  Although Brexit is the priority for the Government, migration is of enormous concern to many partners and was an important focus of our discussions.  This has been a divisive issue and our discussions were difficult and lengthy.  We managed to come to a common European position.  We reached agreement on a number of new steps, including the need to increase funding for the Africa Trust Fund, to which Ireland has trebled its contribution.  There is also an increase in funding for the facility for refugees in Turkey, to establish dedicated funding for migration through the EU budget, to explore the concept of regional disembarkation platforms and the voluntary establishment of control centres within EU member states.  This reinforces the importance of what I have described as our three-pronged approach of securing our external borders, strengthening co-operation with countries of transit and origin and sharing the burden and creating solidarity among member states where a balance of solidarity and responsibility is needed.<\/p>  <p>  In Article 50 format, Mr. Barnier outlined his assessment of the Brexit negotiations to date.  We noted our disappointment at the lack of progress and agreed that if there is no agreement on the backstop and the other outstanding elements, including the European Court of Justice and Gibraltar, it will not be possible to finalise the withdrawal agreement as a whole, including the transition arrangements.  I have always said that I hope the future relationship between the EU and the UK will be as close and comprehensive as possible, and that it will remove any need for a hard border.  This does not remove the need for a legally robust backstop to apply unless and until better arrangements enter into force.  I am grateful that EU partners have given us ongoing support and solidarity on this issue of national interest.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns are at the very heart of the negotiations.

Did the Taoiseach meet or have discussions with Mr. Viktor Orb&aacute;n about the migration issue?  I have seen commentary to the effect that the Taoiseach finds it acceptable that Hungary does not want other people entering its jurisdiction and that it should just be for Hungarians.  If every country in Europe adopted that philosophy, there would be one hell of a migration crisis.  There is also the matter of Mr. Orb&aacute;n's approach to media and European democratic norms, which leaves much to be desired.  I am surprised at the degree to which he is being accommodated and facilitated, both by the European People's Party - of which Fine Gael is a member - and the broader European Union.  No more than Britain's membership of the Single Market, this applies to core values of the European Union, which are steadily being eroded by certain political elements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100024#W02000","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1531314000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I strongly agree with the points made by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and there is an allegation that the European People's Party is giving legitimacy to views being expressed by members which would not be countenanced even a few years ago.

They are deeply concerned and believe the system is unjust and needs to be revised.<\/p>  <p>  We all agree that early childhood is a time of great opportunity for learning and development.  In these early years, children learn through discussion, exploration and play.  Much work has been done to develop Aistear, the early childhood curriculum framework, to assist parents, early years educators and care providers to create enjoyable and challenging learning experiences which allow children to grow and develop as competent and confident learners.  This is a very valuable programme.  I have seen the level of work and preparation that our childcare providers and teachers of junior infants put into this programme to make it such a success.  It is certainly working.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, a child's early years development is substantially enriched by activities which nurture well-being, identity and belonging, communication, exploration and thinking.  The Department's early childhood care scheme, which provides access to such early childhood care and education for children of preschool age, was well received.  It has enriched the universally available offerings in community childcare settings across the State.  However, the proposed changes in September will compel some children to enter the programme too early while denying others their right to start when ready to do so.  That is far from child-centred.  We are moving away from a child-centred approach to an approach that is unworkable and will disadvantage children.<\/p>  <p>  The issues here arise as a result of two factors.  The first is the reduction from three entry points each year to just one.  The second is the reduction in age eligibility from three years to two years and eight months.  Until now, the scheme has provided for three intakes, namely, in January, April and September.  Children who became eligible entered the scheme at the enrolment point closest to their birthday.  My consultations with parents, childcare providers and the county childcare committee, suggest that there were no particular logistical issues arising from this rolling system.  They were quite satisfied with the system and felt it was working well.  A very small minority questioned the value to children of the April intake because it was so close to the summer recess but all reported that the January and September intakes worked well and were flawless.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed change to introduce a single point of entry only, in September, has caused great concern to parents and childcare providers alike.<\/p><p>The current arrangements will deny many children who will become eligible after enrolment access.  They will be obliged to wait it out until the following September.  Children will be affected in varying degrees, depending on their birth dates.  Some children may have a significant loss of entitlement below the 76 weeks provided for over the course of their preschool years.<\/p> <p> The second issue arises from the reduction in age from three years to two years and eight months.  This has implications for childcare providers because many children in this age bracket are not yet fully toilet-trained.  Concerns will arise in this context if childcare facilities are not co-located with full day-care facilities.  The universal opinion of those with whom I have spoken is that three years is the optimum age for entering preschool.  There is anecdotal evidence that children aged two years and eight months are being enrolled even though they are not ready.  It is unsatisfactory that parents have to do this.  However, they feel they have no alternative.  These issues need to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100026#DD00300","speaker":"1440","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531315500,"counter":344,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is well aware, from September 2018 all children meeting the minimum age requirement of two years and eight months will be eligible to participate in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme for a full two years.  This means a total of 76 weeks of the scheme will be available to every child, thereby fulfilling a commitment in the programme for Government.  The current system of three intakes of children was introduced in 2016 to help to expand ECCE from its original 38 weeks to the current average of 61 weeks.  While the expansion of ECCE to 61 weeks on average was a welcome measure, the number of weeks for which children proved eligible varied greatly.  In addition, the April take-up proved poor and the three entry points caused difficulties for children, providers and parents.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs received numerous reports of the three entry points causing significant disruption to children in the learning environment.<\/p>  <p>  Funding was provided in budget 2018 to make two years, or 76 weeks, of ECCE available to all children, thereby significantly enhancing the equity of the scheme.  Depending on a child's month of birth and parental choice regarding school readiness, some parents may decide to start their child in school after one year of ECCE only.  Children are born across 12 months of the year, but there is only one entry point to school.  Therefore, the parents of children who were born at certain times of the year will face harder decisions than the parents of children who were born at other times.  Parents have the discretion to decide how much of ECCE to avail of for their children.  I respect that choice.  A decision may be made to utilise just one year of the programme for various reasons.  For example, some parents of children who were born in the first quarter of the year may opt for them to start school at the age of four rather than the age of five.  Such parents may decide to avail of just one of the two years of ECCE available to them.<\/p>  <p>  Age limits exist for the scheme to guide its usage in a child-centred manner.  The minimum age of two years and eight months was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice.  It had regard to the regulatory environment for early years care and education in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios.  The upper age limit for the scheme reflects the law of the country with regard to enrolment in school and the policy of the Department of Education and Skills.  The refinement of the scheme back to a single enrolment point in September reflects the extra investment, which offers a full two years to all children.  It will help to streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year.  It will make it easier for parents to secure places for their children.  A child will not be able to commence his or her ECCE in September 2018 if he or she has not reached the age of two years and eight months on or before 31 August 2018.  However, such a child will be able to commence ECCE in September 2019 and continue for a further year from September 2020 before commencing school in September 2021.  As with all initiatives introduced or supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we will continue to be open to receiving feedback.  The expansion of ECCE to a full two years this September will be monitored closely by the Department.  Any opportunities for continued improvement will be considered.  I hope this clarifies the situation for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100027#EE00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1531315500,"counter":345,"content":"<p>While I thank the Minister for her response, I have to say it has not clarified the situation.

Many childcare providers and the parents have been calling for the retention of the other two entry points.  They feel it is unfair to retain the September entry point only.

I ask the Minister to review the scheme before September.  I think it would be fair for her to assure us that no child will lose his or her place on this scheme, which has worked well, because of his or her date of birth.

She stated that a number of providers have contacted her to express their view that at least two of the intake times have been working well and without administrative difficulties.  She also indicated that other Deputies received similar representations.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has based its decision on the representations it received from providers and parents regarding the difficulties that are being encountered in administering the scheme, for example, with regard to the three entry points.  In particular, it was mentioned that there was often a lack of places by the time the third entry point was reached.

Major flood events have taken place in Ennis over the years but particularly in 1989, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2004 and 2009.  In fairness to successive Governments, they have made serious investments to mitigate against the potential for Ennis town centre to flood.  In this regard, I welcome the completion of phases 1 and 2 of the Ennis flood relief scheme.  Without the successful implementation of a flood relief plan for Ennis, there is little doubt but that further serious flood events would have had disastrous outcomes for local residents and business owners.<\/p>  <p>  The matter I raise today is the third and last substantial element of alleviation works required for Ennis.  It is known as the Ennis south flood relief scheme.  Few will forget the scene of flood waters pouring over the boundary wall at St. Flannan's College in late November 2009.  Householders in housing estates off the Clare Road, at Clonroadmore, at Tobarteasc&aacute;in, on the Kildysart Road, and in the Ballybeg area of Clarecastle had their homes invaded by floodwaters, with devastating consequences.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme involves the construction of two flood overflow culverts from the stream at St. Flannan's and the stream at Ballybeg to the River Fergus, together with the upgrading of the existing flood defence embankments between the Quin Road and Clarecastle tidal barrage, including rehabilitation, construction of sluices and the upgrading the existing back drainage system.  The St. Flannan's and Ballybeg streams continue to pose serious flood risks to householders in both Ennis and Clarecastle.  Each winter these streams are overwhelmed with water and at times of heavy rainfall, flooding is caused to houses and public roads.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of the Ennis south flood relief scheme, much credit is owed to the outsourced staff of Clare County Council who battle against the elements with pumps to keep houses and public roads free of water.  However, this is unsustainable and a massive drain on resources.  A permanent solution is required, namely, the provision of the Ennis south flood relief scheme.  Householders, business owners and the school community at St. Flannan's have waited patiently since 2009 for this problem to be finally tackled.  It is for this reason that the Minister of State's visit to Ennis on 27 February 2018 was very welcome.  He was the bearer of good news.  A package of &euro;8.6 million was supposed to be in place to enable the scheme to finally move to construction.  To put it mildly, it is deeply disturbing and highly concerning that the scheme has been delayed yet again.  All the delays mean the scheme will cost more and more.  An additional charge will be placed on the taxpayer.  All the time, the residents, business people and school authorities at St. Flannan's are left without proper flood protection measures, and they cannot get full flood insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Today I am asking the Minister of State to put on the record of the D&aacute;il, in clear language, the reason for the delay.  The very people who are depending on the scheme, many of whom I have been speaking to over the past week, are really concerned.  They actually feel misled because last February they were left with the clear impression that the scheme was moving forward this month.  I want the Minister of State to inform the House which body is responsible for the delay.  Is it Clare County Council or the Office of Public Works, OPW?  Who will take responsibility?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100028#FF00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1531316100,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy English, for attending to respond.  I wish to raise with him two issues that relate to the recent local area plan for Celbridge.  One has to do with lands zoned or highlighted in the plan, at Hazelhatch train station in Celbridge.  The other is to assist positively in helping to deliver the second bridge for Celbridge to allow the town develop and grow further as the population grows.  It is currently over 22,000.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the lands at Hazelhatch train station, the reference in the local area plan is section 4.6.  The lands are right beside the train station.  The plan identifies them as key and strategic development lands.  There is a master plan to be implemented as soon as possible to allow for the delivery of houses in the area because, as referred to in the local area plan, it is an area of key and strategic development. It is important to note that all the stakeholders involved in this area are ready to go but need to partner with the local authority or Department to make that happen.  They are ready to go to make progress on the master plan to allow for the delivery of housing, which we all know is urgently needed.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State probably heard recently from my colleague, Deputy Durkan, that the land in question is right beside the train station.  It is about a two-minute walk from it.  It is within a few minutes' walk from Celbridge GAA Club, Celbridge Tennis Club and a school.  There is easy access to the M7, M8, M9 and M50.  There are flooding issues in the area, on which works are under way, thanks to the assistance of the Minister of State's colleague who just left the Chamber, the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, who has been working with me positively on this.  There is a site owned by the Department through Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board that has been identified as a location for two permanent schools.<\/p><p>This is all very positive.  The lands at Hazelhatch beside the train station fit all the criteria and are not dependent on infrastructure to be developed.  What is the process to get this started, to allow the master plan to be agreed with the relevant stakeholders and to progress to the delivery of the required housing and the services that go along with it?<\/p> <p> I will now turn to the second bridge for Celbridge.  The land that is zoned in this regard is referred to as 12.2.5 KDA 5 - Simmonstown in the local area plan.  These lands have been zoned following a submission made by the Department to the recent local area plan.  It will ultimately lead to approximately 1,300 houses being constructed.  The difficulty is that this side of Celbridge cannot grow or be developed further because of the lack of infrastructure.  The infrastructure required in this area is a second bridge in Celbridge to cross the Liffey and to alleviate congestion, reduce gridlock and help people go about their daily lives in an easier and more efficient way.  We have been seeking this for 20 years or more and this is an opportunity to find out if it can happen.<\/p> <p> I have had a very positive meeting with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on this project.  I ask the Minister of State to engage with the Minister, Deputy Ross, and then consider if he can give Kildare County Council the approval and funding it needs to allow it to proceed to route selection.  That is the critical phase that will ultimately decide where the structure will be and the access roads to it.  Then a design detail will be done and it will go to tender in time.  However, we cannot consider that aspiration until the route selection is completed, which I am given to understand can take up to 15 months.  It requires the commitment of the Department.  Given that it is tied to the development of the town and particularly in view of the submission from the Department regarding the lands outlined for zoning, I hope the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government can work with the Minister, Deputy Ross, to give approval to Kildare County Council to get that done.<\/p> <p> The bridge in Celbridge currently serves 19,000 vehicles per day.  That is more than the traffic on most national secondary roads and some national primary roads in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100028#FF00700","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531316700,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to discuss the advancement of housing development in Celbridge, specifically with regard to vacant lands, which have been identified as an area of key and strategic development, and to discuss the attendant infrastructure measures that have to be implemented to deliver this housing supply.  This housing supply has been identified as necessary by Kildare County Council and certainly from a national point of view it is needed and sustainable, so we would be supportive of the key infrastructure that is required to open up these lands.<\/p>  <p>  The Celbridge local area plan, LAP, for 2017 to 2023 was adopted by the elected members in August 2017 and came into effect in September 2017.  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban development, I welcome the fact that the plan supports the provision of substantial housing development in a key urban area close to Dublin.  Kildare County Council in its county development plan has earmarked Celbridge to grow in population by approximately 10,000 over the next five to ten years.  We must plan for this and for the infrastructure that is required to make it happen.  We must ensure that Celbridge has a heart and soul, which means we need more than just the sprawling housing developments surrounding weak town centres that are so symptomatic of many Irish commuter towns.  We want Celbridge to be more than just a dormitory commuter town; we want the population of the town to be part of the community and the spirit of the town.  That is what Deputy O'Rourke wants too, and Deputy Durkan made representations to us on this issue as well.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the roll-out of the local area plan and in the interests of supporting the integrated development of housing within the LAP, Kildare County Council is committed to preparing a transport mobility management plan to support the sustainable growth of the town.  State agencies, along with my Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA, will be active in their support of the development of such a plan, which will inform future infrastructure development.  That includes the bridge.  I will be happy for my Department to follow up with the Minister, Deputy Ross, on that because it is a key part of opening up the lands on which we need houses built.  Irish Water is in the process of upgrading the Leixlip wastewater treatment plant, which serves Celbridge, and is actively working to address identified constraints in the local wastewater system, in particular the upgrading of the local pumping station.  These measures will actively support the ongoing and future delivery of housing in Celbridge.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department recently opened a call for proposals under the new urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, which was launched as part of Project Ireland 2040.  The fund is designed to support the compact growth and sustainable development of Ireland's five cities, regional drivers and other large urban centres such as Celbridge, and to leverage a greater proportion of residential and commercial development supported by infrastructure, services and amenities within the existing built-up areas of our larger urban settlements.  My Department has responsibility for implementing the URDF, which has an allocation of &euro;2 billion over the ten-year period of the national development plan to 2027, with &euro;100 million available to get projects moving in a meaningful way in 2019.  We call that the A list.  Projects such as the bridge the Deputy mentioned could be fitted into that if it can be moved through the system.  It is important that the next stage is taken on the bridge and I urge all involved to make that happen in order that it can fit into this funding over the next couple of years.  The fund encompasses the local infrastructure fund, which is also an activation measure to provide the infrastructure that is key to opening up land.  It would fit into that, but it must go through the different stages.  For my part, I will follow up with the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I urge the local authority in Kildare to do likewise.<\/p>  <p>  The application process for the new fund will run until September 2018.  Proposals that have been identified by local authorities must demonstrate that they will be: innovative and transformational urban regeneration projects; public sector led and with the option of community or private sector partners or both; matched by at least 25% direct funding from other public or private sources or both; a minimum bid of &euro;2 million; a catalyst for development that would not otherwise occur; or likely to leverage significant further public and private sector investment.  I have visited Celbridge.  I was there when we were making decisions on the plan and on the directions we had to issue, so I am familiar with the town.  I walked on the bridge, stood on it and parked on the bridge because that is what one does - one parks on the bridge-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100029#GG00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1531316700,"counter":356,"content":"<p>You would not want to stand on it for too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100029#GG00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531316700,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Exactly.

What is key here is to break it down to the two projects.  One is the land at Hazelhatch train station.  It is not just me or the Minister of State saying it is strategic land for development in the short to medium term, that is agreed in the local area plan.  Many areas are depending on infrastructure before they can be developed but this not one of them.  All the services are in place.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are advocating more public transport.  We are making submissions to BusConnects to get increased public transport in the Celbridge and north Kildare area.  The footfall through Hazelhatch train station shows it has the least number of passengers using the station on a daily and weekly basis, so this is an opportunity.  It is not sprawling development but cohesive development from the town outwards.  The development is being brought in a strategic way to the services I have mentioned.  I hope this debate could kick off that process because all the stakeholders are ready to go and are motivated to make it happen.  We want to see how we can move that on in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the second bridge for Celbridge, as the Ceann Comhairle said one certainly would not wish to stand on it for too long.  Unfortunately, for most people who drive out of Celbridge each day it takes them 45 minutes to travel 300 m because 19,000 vehicles are crossing that bridge and it cannot cater for that.  I am not being opportunistic and saying this is the Minister of State's problem.  It is an historical problem.  However, there is an opportunity now to solve it.  Kildare County Council is willing to lead on this but it needs the green light from the Government, including the Minister of State's Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, so it can progress to the next stage.  If the Minister of State wrote the cheque tomorrow morning it could not be built.  It must go through a process.  The Ministers must give Kildare County Council the approval to go through that process in order that this necessary infrastructure can be put in place for Celbridge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100029#GG00500","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1531316700,"counter":359,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct that it is not any one person's or one agency's problem, but it is a problem for the community and for anybody who wishes to drive through Celbridge or to work or live there.  We would be anxious that it would happen too.  The focus of all the stakeholders - the council, local businesses, landowners, State agencies and the wider community - should be on implementing the Celbridge local area plan.  Both I and my Department will work proactively with Kildare County Council in this regard in terms of infrastructure delivery and sustainable urban development.  We will link with other Departments as well to try to move this along because it is important that it go through the different stages.<\/p><p>A new crossing of the Liffey is identified as a strategic infrastructural development for Celbridge and, in particular, Simmonstown.  A second bridge crossing will form an important part of the transport infrastructural assessment for Celbridge as it will be a key item in the delivery of supporting infrastructure for the planned development of the town, again in a sustainable manner, to open up other lands to town centre development and also to open it up to housing delivery.  We want to see Celbridge developed in a sustainable way.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also asked about the land at Hazelhatch, which is in the vicinity of Hazelhatch railway station.  This land has been identified in the local area plan as a flood risk and also as a key piece of land to be developed.  I understand that the council has undertaken in the local area plan to continue working with the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, on the extent of the flood risk and measures to deal with it.  It is important that these lands are provided for future development as part of a master plan.  The Department likes to see land use being properly planned via a master plan, in which a local authority takes the lead and works with local land owners.  The flood risk issue will need to be addressed before plans can be put in place for use of the land, but in a sustainable manner that will develop Celbridge in a positive way for people who want to live there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100029#GG00600","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccine Damage Compensation Scheme","time":1531317300,"counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100030#HH00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317300,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion and I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Daly, to the House.  This matter relates to issues arising in regard to the Pandemrix vaccination for swine flu some years ago, but I want to put on record my unequivocal support for vaccination when vaccines are available.  That said, my ambition is to ensure that when known side effects or issues arise with a small number of patients who have been vaccinated appropriate care pathways are put in place for them and that a compensation scheme is put in place for these people in line with the recommendation of the vaccination steering group several years ago and committed to in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  On 18 May 2009, Dr. Brendan Corcoran signed a contract with GSK for 8 million Pandemrix vaccines manufactured with the benefit of an adjuvant known as AS03, manufactured in Dresden in Germany.  An adjuvant is a stimulant to the immune system which means less core vaccine is put into the vaccination, which is a cost saving measure to the company.  It is within this adjuvant that a problem may have arisen.  When this contract was signed Pandemrix had not been clinically tested and no risk analysis of it had been done, and this was known.  As a result the HSE had to provide an indemnity to GSK before it would agree to provide it to Ireland.  The European Medicines Agency, as part of the licensing, demanded that GSK keep all details of any adverse impacts of this particular vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  In October-November 2009, just before the vaccination programme commenced, leaflets were distributed to patients that promoted false and incorrect information.  Patients were told that Pandemrix is as safe as the ordinary flu vaccine but this was not known to be true at that time, and in fact is false.  They were also told that Pandemrix was clinically tested.  This was known to be not true and false yet it was produced by the HSE in our name as a State.  The office of the Chief Medical Officer was informed by the Irish Medicines Board of its concern in the absence of clinical testing and a risk analysis regarding the dosage, if any, that could be administered to children or pregnant women.<\/p>  <p>  Why was the public told lies in this way while health professionals were given different information?  The incidence of swine flu began to decline in week 42 of 2009.  In other words, one week prior to commencement of the vaccination programme on 25 October 2009.  Four days later on 29 October 2009 GSK informed the HSE of significant adverse outcomes but the vaccination programme continued.  By week three of 2010 incidents of swine flue was down to one case per week but still the vaccination programme continued.  Why?  Was it really necessary or was it the case that having purchased 8 million vaccines at an alleged cost of &euro;80 million we needed to save face?  This 8 million vaccines amounts to two for every person in the State, with a prescribed lifespan.  Rather than have a voting machines type debacle we continued to prescribe regardless.<\/p>  <p>  As this vaccine had not been clinically tested and no risk analysis of it had been undertaken general practitioners, GPs, had to be fully indemnified by the State Claims Agency before they agreed to vaccinate people.  Was the State Claims Agency provided with the information that GSK was sending in regularly in regard to adverse outcomes?  Where are we now?  In 2012, Dr. Darina O'Flanagan on behalf of the State, along with others in Norway and Sweden where the same vaccine had been administered, reported a proven link between narcolepsy and the Pandemrix vaccination.  This is now established.  A number of children and young adults have experienced life altering illnesses.  Some have taken cases to the courts and others are desperately awaiting State assistance and compensation commensurate with those life altering illnesses.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to outline his proposals to compensate these people who are suffering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100030#HH00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317300,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy MacSharry for the opportunity to update the House on this issue.

I take this opportunity to update the House of what was known at that time.  In August 2010, the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority reported that it was investigating six cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of the Pandemrix vaccine during the pandemic.  This was followed later that month by reports from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare noting there had been a more than expected number of cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents that year.  On 23 September 2010, the Committee on Human Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency concluded in its initial review of available data that the available evidence did not confirm a link but that more research was needed.<\/p><p>By the end of March 2011, the Irish Medicines Board - now the Health Products Regulatory Agency - had received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix vaccines.  The Department of Health and the HSE agreed that the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre would work with the Irish Medicines Board and Irish clinical experts in narcolepsy to examine the Irish data and report on the findings.  The information I have just given is included in the final report of national narcolepsy study steering committee entitled, Investigation of an increase in the incidence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents in 2009 and 2010, published on 19 April 2012.  As Deputies are aware, I cannot comment on individual cases or matters that are the subject of litigation.  However, I can provide background information and clarify matters that are already in the public domain.<\/p><p>The management of these cases transferred to the State Claims Agency on 15 October 2013 when the Taoiseach signed the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions) (Amendment) Order 2013.

The Department has engaged with the HSE and the Departments of Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure the provision of a range of services and supports on an <i>ex gratia<\/i>basis.  The HSE's advocacy unit acts as a liaison with other service providers and Departments to facilitate access to required services.

Ministers need to take a much more hands-on role in regard to how the State Claims Agency handles cases.<\/p><p>Last year the Minister, Deputy Harris, was quoted in the media as saying that the Department was considering a compensation scheme for side effects of important vaccines in line with the steering group on vaccines which had gone back over several years.  That is over a year ago: what has happened?  It is six years since our own Dr. Darina O'Flanagan established and proved the link with narcolepsy which concurs with the Swedes and Norwegians who also used the same one, and yet we have done nothing.  I accept there is discretion in medical cards and there are a few bits and pieces to help people out, but no compensation commensurate with the level of suffering they have with lifelong and life-altering illnesses such as narcolepsy.<\/p> <p> I am unequivocally in favour of vaccination.  I have been vaccinated with Pandemrix as have my children.  Luckily for us we have no side effects.  Some do and they are entitled to be compensated as such.  We need to bear in mind that Dr. Brendan Corcoran on behalf of the State signed a contract for 8 million vaccines in 2009 in the knowledge that it was not clinically tested and had no risk analysis.  I am putting it in the public record, if the Minister of State feels it needs to be on the public record before he can comment.  The Irish Medicines Board expressed its concerns about this to the office of Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer, and nothing happened.  The State intentionally lied to patients in three patient-information leaflets telling people it was tested when it had not been, that it was as safe as the ordinary flu vaccine when it was not, and that it was exactly the same as Celvapan and other vaccines when it was not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100030#HH00500","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531317900,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100031#JJ00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317900,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I ask that the Minister of State seek with the Department of Finance, through the NTMA and the SCA, to desist from costly defences in these cases, engage and offer immediate mediation, and put in place an appropriate compensation scheme for the girls and boys, young women and young men-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100031#JJ00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317900,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100031#JJ00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317900,"counter":369,"content":"<p>-----who have had life-altering illnesses.<\/p><p>Finally, let me say-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100031#JJ00500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317900,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Deputy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100031#JJ00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317900,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Can the Minister of State ensure that the State never knowingly lies to patients again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100031#JJ00700","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317900,"counter":372,"content":"<p>The development of a national narcolepsy service continues to progress.

The concept behind the TEN-T network was to improve transport corridors, enabling economic growth and cohesion and connectivity within Europe.  It covers all modes of transport - road, rail, sea and air.  Maintaining and improving strong, modern and competitive links with the rest of the EU is vital to securing Ireland's economic future and ensuring that Ireland's strong social and political links with our European counterparts are maintained.  Given the level of engagement the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has had with his counterparts over the last two years, I question if he subscribes to this.<\/p><p>In order to have this connectivity we must improve Ireland's transport infrastructure, which has huge gaps due to lack of investment over the past decade, in order to deal with the growth in Ireland's population and economy.  The short-sightedness of this and the previous Government has not only restricted economic growth and prevented regions from reaching their full potential, but it is also having severe negative consequences on the quality of people's lives.  The length of time people are spending commuting has increased significantly in recent years.  We have significant overcrowding on public transport.  These matters need to be addressed now.<\/p><p>TEN-T has two layers: a core network and a comprehensive network.  Under the last review covering the period from 2014 to 2020 the TEN-T network comprised upgrades to the Cork to Dublin and Dublin to Belfast rail network, and investment in Cork and Dublin ports.  When submitting Ireland's proposals to the EU the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who is now Taoiseach, severely lacked ambition.  He did not include much of what he could have included and also removed key projects in the west of Ireland.  I will leave my colleagues to deal with that.<\/p><p>The benefit from inclusion in TEN-T designation is the eligibility for funding from the Connecting Europe Facility.  As well as eligibility for funding, it makes it much easier to access loans from the European Investment Bank and it is more attractive for public private partnerships.<\/p><p>The review of the TEN-T network is not due to take place until 2023.  We believe given the significance of Brexit on the movement of goods and people for Ireland, we must make a compelling case now.  In reply to a parliamentary question earlier this week, the Minister stated: &quot;My Department is also committed to making a more detailed submission to the European Commission in respect of the TEN-T network, taking account of the implications of Brexit...&quot;  I do not see a sense of urgency coming from the Minister or the rest of Government on this.  The European Commissioner for Mobility and Transport, Ms. Violeta Bulc, recently stated that extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary actions.<\/p><p>Two thirds of Irish exports use the British land bridge to reach continental Europe.  It is vital that Ireland seeks out alternatives which much include significant investment in our ports.  If we look at the ports' designation, Ireland is totally out of sync with the rest of Europe.  Ireland with a coastline of 2,795 km and a population of 4.7 million has five ports designated in the TEN-T network.  Malta with a coastline of 135 km and a population of 436,000 has four ports designated in the TEN-T network.  Scotland has 11 ports designated and Denmark has 22 ports designated.  I use that as a comparator to show how out of sync we are and how urgently we need to review our TEN-T network.  I remind the Minister that when he signed up to A Programme for a Partnership Government, he was going to complete a review within the first three months of Government.  In responding to the motion the Minister might enlighten the House as to how that review is going and when we can expect an outcome from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100031#JJ01000","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1531317900,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Brexit will mean big changes for our exporters and will have a major impact on Ireland's connectivity with Europe, which is central to our economy and society.  It is estimated that up to 80% of Irish exports travel through Britain to get to mainland Europe using Britain as a land bridge, because it offers the quickest route to mainland Europe and other markets beyond.  Swift routes are particularly important to the agrifood sector and others exporting perishable goods for obvious reasons.<\/p><p>If a good is perishable, it becomes less valuable as time passes and it remains in transit.  This leads to an increase in the cost of exporting from Ireland and makes our goods more expensive and less competitive.  When the UK becomes a third country and is outside of the EU, we could be looking at serious delays at Dover Port, where many trucks may have to queue for extended periods before making the crossing to Calais in France.  This is a big concern for exporters and alternative options for transport must be explored across the country, not just in Dublin.  We need the facility to bypass the UK and go straight to mainland Europe but this requires larger and faster ships and greater investment in our ports.  We cannot wait until 2040 for this.  It needs to happen now or we will be in trouble next March.  We need to ensure proper transit security for our exporters and reduce our reliance on the UK land bridge which leaves us in a precarious position.<\/p> <p> Even if Brexit were not happening, we should be making these investments in order to ensure security for our exporters and also to ensure that we are not overly reliant on the UK.  We do not know what will be the final outcome of Brexit.  We do not know what the future relationship between the UK and the EU will look like.  We do not even know when that will be finalised.  What we do know is we need to make preparations and we need to make them now.<\/p> <p> A key part of our national response to Brexit should be to urgently review Ireland&rsquo;s core network under the TEN-T funding programme.  The goalposts have moved.  Things have changed.  These are exceptional circumstances.  The review needs to happen now, not in 2023.  I have spoken about this issue previously.  It was utter madness to remove, in their entirety, the west and north west from the core network of the TEN-T funding programme.  The TEN-T network is made up of two layers.  The first is the comprehensive network which leads to the core network.  One must be on the comprehensive network to make it onto the core network.  The last Fine Gael-led Government, under the leadership of Deputy Leo Varadkar, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport at the time, removed the western rail corridor from the comprehensive network, thereby precluding the entire western region from being on the core map.  That has massively disadvantaged the entire region and flies in the face of all balanced regional development.  In order to qualify for core funding an area has to be on the core map.  That is true for rail and road.  The removal of the western rail corridor disqualified the western arc from Cork to Derry, Galway Port, Ireland West Airport in Knock and all other major infrastructure in the West from receiving core funding.<\/p> <p> Article 1.2 of Decision No. 1692\/96\/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 July 1996 on community guidelines, which set up the European transport network and the TEN-T funding, does not mandate the State to have funding in place in order to leave projects on the application.  There was no justification for removing the projects to which I refer.  The State was not mandated to do so.  Funding did not have to have been in place.  They could have been left on.  The then European Commissioner for Transport, in a letter to Brian Crowley, MEP, of Fianna F&aacute;il, confirmed that the Commission&rsquo;s role is to specify targets and criteria but that member states retained substantial sovereign rights to decide on the projects.  Member states decide what projects go on the network.  The previous Fine Gael-led Government removed the west and the north west from that project.  The comprehensive network, on which we have been allowed remain, only accounts for 5% of available funding.  The remaining 95% goes to the core network.  We are precluded from applying for any of that funding.<\/p> <p> I am asking the Minister to review the network.  The core TEN-T funding available covers the period up to 2030.  There is a review coming up but it is not fast enough.  It is far too long to wait until 2023 particularly in light of Brexit and the fact we have to develop all of our ports and all of our transport infrastructure to deal with the incoming impact of it.  It is incumbent on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, as Minister with responsibility for those issues, to ensure the review happens immediately, that we do not wait and that we do everything to ensure the west and north west get back on to the core network and that we get the infrastructure and investment we need in our ports, road and rail networks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100031#JJ01100","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531318500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I will speak in favour of the motion that has been tabled by my colleague, Deputy Troy, as our transport spokesperson, outlining the glaring gaps in the infrastructure in our capital and the rest of our country.  Naturally, I am concerned about my region, the mid-west and Limerick in particular.  There is no doubt our transport infrastructure system is creaking at the seams and is not fit for purpose.  We have had almost a decade of underinvestment.  It has been accentuated by population growth and by the economy growing.  The Government, on the Minister's watch, has failed to produce any real plan to deal with this comprehensively.  The gaps are harming Ireland's economic growth, the economic growth of my constituency and of the region I represent.  It is harming people's quality of life.  It is also preventing our rural towns and rural areas from achieving their fullest potential.  We need to have a plan as soon as possible and a plan that will be delivered in a real and meaningful way with funding.  On top of all of this, we have Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In the time available, I will refer to the Shannon Foynes Port Company which is headquartered in my constituency in the town of Foynes but which also operates out of Limerick city.  It is charged with the handling of cargo and freight up and down the Shannon Estuary.  The Minister should know it has plans to develop new business and new shipping routes by using unitised and container traffic and developing new routes directly to the UK.  I ask the Minister to take every opportunity to support it.  The justification for trying to develop it is Brexit but also the fact that Dublin - including its port - is completely gridlocked with congestion on many levels.  At the Shannon Foynes Port Company headquarters in Foynes, there is ample opportunity to expand to meet the plan it is projecting and also to accommodate the logistical and customs issues.  To achieve that plan, we have to be able to link to the motorway network.  The proposed Limerick to Foynes motorway is slipping down the timescale for delivery.  I ask the Minister to take a keen interest in delivering that motorway proposal.  It is about to go to planning.  All the boxes seem to have been ticked by the road design office people.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will also be aware the proposed liquefied natural gas, LNG, facility at Ballylongford in Kerry is coming back on the radar again.

We were given nothing.  I do not blame the Minister, Deputy Ross.  It was our current Taoiseach who had scant regard for the western coastline and the midlands.  It is the one part of Ireland that can be developed.  Look at what the Government has done.  In 2011, it withdrew the grants from the airports in Galway and Sligo.  The Minister and others may say that they were not important but there were businessmen from London and France flying into Galway Airport looking at projects to create jobs and they do not come any more.  They will not fly into Shannon Airport and take an hour to get up to Galway city because they cannot afford the time.  As the Minister and others know, if one is in business time is of the essence and things move fast.  These people no longer come here.  It was a huge mistake to take away the grants from places like Galway and Sligo.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland West Airport in Knock should be turned into a national airport.  That is what we need to develop the west of Ireland.  Then we can develop the industrial zones.  The way we were treated when these projects were put in before was absolutely outrageous.  That is why we need this review as quickly as possible.  I am constantly coming in here pleading with the Minister about the N4 and the N5 and how difficult it is to get them developed.  While the Minister and his colleagues in government tell us they are in process, not much is happening.  They will not be developed for the next five or six or maybe eight years.  I hope I am wrong.  I hope the Minister can confirm to the House that the projects will move forward as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The regional roads in the west and the midlands are in a mess.

In particular, Rosslare Europort, as a tier 2 port, is a key player in the commercial trade of the south east and in the tourism industry nationally.  In Wicklow, much commercial trade is progressed through Rosslare and the strategic decisions to locate many industries in Wicklow are dependent on the capacities of Dublin and Rosslare to accommodate their transport needs.  The much-hyped national planning framework makes vague references to upgrading tier 2 ports between now and 2040.  The national development plan, which is the investment plan for the next ten years, does not mention any tier 2 port projects, including Rosslare.  The implications to the national and regional economy from a failure to fully invest in upgrades to Rosslare Europort would be careless in normal economic cycles but the changes to our trade as a result of Brexit make this lack of attention a dereliction of duty by Government.<\/p>  <p>  The implications of Brexit to the land bridge transport system in the UK, used by 80% of Irish traded goods, are potentially catastrophic.  The potential for Rosslare Europort's growth and capacity for growth is, therefore, urgent.  Apart from the urgent need for trade, industrial and commercial development for south Wicklow, the tourism industry for the entire garden county will require investment in the infrastructure to allow coach tours and self-drive tourists to access Rosslare in a post-Brexit world.<\/p>  <p>  This Government must prioritise a full review of the EU TEN-T programme to leverage funding for Rosslare Europort.

In fact, I understand the previous regulations were deemed to be ineffective as the network was too large and spread too widely.  The European Commission proposed, instead, the concept of a comprehensive network with a subset called the core network.  Many elements of the transport network in the west and north west are on the comprehensive TEN-T network.  This comprehensive network includes, on the western seaboard, rail links between Limerick and Galway, Dublin and Westport, Dublin and Sligo and Dublin and Galway.  In the case of roads, it includes a number of major roads across the west and north west, including cross-Border roads, and other transport facilities such as the airports at Knock, Donegal, Sligo and Shannon as well as the port of Derry.<\/p><p>Within the comprehensive network, the core network links the main nodes or centres of the European transport system.  On the island of Ireland, the core network includes the transport links from Belfast to Dublin to Cork with an offshoot to Shannon-Foynes.  This characteristic of a wider comprehensive network, with a more limited core transport network, is similar to other member states.  For example, across the Irish Sea, Scotland has no core network north of the Glasgow-Edinburgh line.  Likewise large swathes of  France and Sweden do not are without a core network.  This is replicated in many member states.<\/p><p>Inclusion on the comprehensive and core networks places legal obligations on member states.  Generally, this means that core network infrastructure should be in place to the specified technical standards by 2030 and the comprehensive network infrastructure by 2050.  The inclusion of a project on the TEN-T network does not give rise to any automatic entitlement to funding.  Instead, funding decisions are on a competitive basis against projects from all across the European Union.  Typically, these competitive processes - or calls - are significantly oversubscribed.<\/p><p>Matching co-funding is a prerequisite for projects put forward under calls for proposals.  All TEN-T projects put forward must, among other things, have co-financing in place.  The regulations provide for co-financing for works at up to 20 %, with up to 30% available to alleviate bottlenecks.  In limited circumstances, co-financing of up to 40% can be provided for cross-border rail projects on the core network.  With a co-funding rate of, for example, 20% for Exchequer-funded projects, the member state is still required to fund the remaining 80%.<\/p><p>Against the backdrop of a difficult economic climate in 2011, Ireland was required to consider the specific implications of the proposed network for its transport infrastructure, as well as its financial capacity to complete the technical specifications of its portion of the network within the timeframes proposed.  This was against a backdrop of challenging management of State revenue and expenditure.  In 2011 alone, the State recorded a deficit of &euro;21 billion.  The capital budget of the Department was reduced drastically during this period.  It was cut from &euro;2.1 billion in 2010 to &euro;950 million in 2013.  This was the economic reality at that time.<\/p><p>It was in this context that Ireland, as with other member states, liaised with the European Commission regarding its views on the appropriateness of the draft network in line with the proposed methodology and the affordability of the completion of the network at that time.  This resulted in sections of the proposed network not ultimately being included in the final TEN-T maps agreed in 2013.  However, my Department plans to make a comprehensive submission to the European Commission, in line with the commitment contained in A Programme for Partnership Government, for the Government to apply to the EU for the revision of the TEN-T core network, including in respect of the cross-border western arc.  This submission will take account of the implications of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the UK&rsquo;S departure from the EU and the impact this will have on our future transport connectivity.  It will also take account of the Government&rsquo;s plans under Project Ireland 2040 and the implications of the implementation of the national planning framework.<\/p><p>These issues and the intention to make a submission have been raised by my Department with the European Commission.  The submission will call for an early review of Ireland&rsquo;s TEN-T network.  This would tie in with what the European Commissioner for Mobility and Transport, Ms Violeta BuIc, said during her visit to Ireland last October, to the effect that the extraordinary circumstances of Brexit call for extraordinary actions or solutions.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the budgetary position of the State at that time, the Government proceeded with the largest transport project in this State since 2011.  This was the Gort-Tuam motorway which opened last year and which was prioritised and delivered at the height of the economic crisis at a total cost to the Exchequer and PPP contractors of &euro;1.149 billion.  Since then the Government has agreed a hugely ambitious roll-out of infrastructure projects across the State under Project Ireland 2040.  Within this plan, the Government recognises the importance of transport links in the regions, and particularly between the north west and other parts of the country.  The plan prioritises transport projects such as the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin, the N5 Westport to Turlough, the N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramogue, the A5 road development and the Galway city ring road.  These improved links, and others contained in Project Ireland 2040, when constructed, will address shortfalls in connectivity between the regions and enhance connectivity to our international gateway ports and airports.<\/p><p>This in turn will assist in overcoming some of the potential fallout from Brexit.  Speaking of connectivity, I fully appreciate that the decision of the UK to leave the European Union could negatively affect Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity to the wider world, particularly for trade.  One immediate implication identified was our ability to continue to use the UK landbridge as an efficient and timely route for our goods to make their way to European markets.  While the EU-UK Brexit negotiations are ongoing and the future EU-UK relationship remains uncertain at present, the Government is working to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s use of the UK landbridge can and will continue in as seamless a manner as is possible.  It is clear that Brexit may result in new or increased direct shipping routes from Ireland to continental Europe, and this is already happening and is welcome.  <\/p> <p> Providing greater transport options can only be of benefit to our exporters and imports.  Nevertheless, the Government is conscious of the continuing critical importance of the landbridge to many sectors of our economy and will continue to work with the European Commission, Mr. Michel Barnier&rsquo;s team and our EU partners to minimise any potential impact.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, in conjunction with my Department, is currently finalising a study into the use of the UK landbridge by Irish importers and exporters.  This study will seek to establish the volume of Ireland&rsquo;s traffic using the UK landbridge at present, the likely consequences Brexit may have on our use of the UK landbridge and the various alternative options that may be viable.  The study is expected to be completed shortly and will be published.<\/p> <p> I am also undertaking a national ports capacity study, which will take account of Brexit and the future capacity requirements of our ports.  The study will be completed later this year.  The UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU in 2019 highlights the importance of high-quality international maritime connectivity and the importance of continuing investment to further improve the quality of port facilities.  This is relevant to all our ports of national significance, both tier 1 and tier 2 ports, given their potential role in maintaining transportation linkages with crucial EU markets.  The Government&rsquo;s national ports policy provides a supportive policy framework at national level to enable competition and investment within the port sector.  This policy is complimentary to and a good fit with wider European policy and facilitates historically high level of capital investment being made in our ports&rsquo; infrastructure.  At present, the ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes are all undertaking major capital infrastructure programmes with a combined investment of close to &euro;350 million, part funded by the European Union under the TEN-T Connecting Europe Facility, and designed to enhance capacity.<\/p> <p> In support of these investments, a Government priority under Project 2040 is to strengthen access routes to our ports through upgrading and enhancing the road transport network.  Examples of such investments include the ongoing development of the M11 to improve connectivity to Rosslare in the south east, the planned N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy road to improve access to the Port of Cork and the N21-N69 Limerick to Adare to Foynes road to improve access to Shannon Foynes Port.  The combination of these investments will strengthen the overall ability of our maritime infrastructure to cope with the demands that may arise from Brexit.  Nevertheless, after the UK leaves the EU, we will no longer share a land border with another EU member state and Ireland&rsquo;s missing link to the rest of the EU will become the sea.

Fianna F&aacute;il will be well acquainted with the issue, as it was in government for decades and did not bother with long-term, sustainable planning and development.  After it bankrupted the country, another decade passed without investment in infrastructure.  This was a policy decision by Labour and Fine Gael to punish ordinary people for the financial disaster created by the State and the banks.  Instead of investing to encourage economic growth to provide a decent quality of life for our people, the Government cut spending on services and on capital spend.  We now find ourselves way behind other modern European countries.  Our infrastructure is still lacking, and we are now at a stage where the State cannot even house families.  We have 100,000 people on housing lists.<\/p>  <p>  I mention all this because it is relevant to the motion.  It is just a motion, not a Bill and, therefore, it will achieve nothing.   It is all very well to call for investment in various areas, but Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il appear to be incapable of delivering anything, whether in government separately or together, as they are today.  Project Ireland 2040 appears to be an aspirational PR initiative.  It is likely that most of its commitments will go undelivered, like previous strategies with fine PR exercises lying on the shelf gathering dust.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is in favour of investing in infrastructure.  We need to invest to allow for sustainable economic growth to promote strong communities and balanced regional development, and for accessibility.  We need to do it in a way that is economically beneficial to the State, sustainable, and in keeping with our emissions targets.  As Britain prepares to leave the EU, we need to Brexit-proof this State.  We need to ensure that we have adequate transport links with the European continent via sea and air to ensure our economic and social relationships are maintained.  A good start would be to continue to invest in cross-Border and Border projects such as the A5 and Narrow Water Bridge.  We also have to invest in our regional ports and airports to ensure optimum international transport links in a post-Brexit EU.  This will boost the connectivity of the regions, which are not experiencing an economic recovery, to allow for economic growth as well as growth in tourism.  To support our regional airports, we must prioritise rail and road links to realise their potential and to ensure balanced regional development.  Sinn F&eacute;in is also in favour of the development of strategic development zones around key regional airports.  <\/p>  <p>  When it comes to Brexit, my own constituency of Louth is in a Border county, and I would urge specific investment in the Border region.  We cannot be like the British Conservative Party and keep our heads in the sand.  We have to invest and prepare for Brexit.  Drogheda port needs significant investment and it is vital that we get the go-ahead for the port to access the northern cross route if the town is going to develop economically in the way that it should.  <\/p>  <p>  The west and north west have been utterly neglected by successive Governments.  The exclusion by the previous Government of projects in the west and north west from the TEN-T submission was shameful.  The Taoiseach ensured that the western rail corridor and the upgrade of Galway and Sligo airports were deleted from an EU-wide transport programme in 2011.  The Government talks about regional development, but actively works against it.  The motion calls for a review of the TEN-T network ahead of the 2023 due date.  That is a reasonable ambition, and no one would argue otherwise.  However, there is a commitment in the programme for partnership Government to apply to the EU for the revision of the TEN-T core network within three months of the formation of government.  Fianna F&aacute;il is now a part of this partnership Government.  Why is it calling on its partners in government to implement agreed policy?  This is ridiculous.  It is appearing in the House with a motion as if it is not a part of the Government; it is playing at being the Opposition.  The party knows that a motion has no legal standing and is not worth the paper it is written on.  It should stop taking people for fools, because they can see through this.  They see Fianna F&aacute;il coming from a mile away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100035#NN00100","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1531320300,"counter":429,"content":"<p>At least Fianna F&aacute;il is contributing.

The A5 Dublin to Derry road is a vital project that will help connect these two cities and provide good transport links for communities along this route, particularly in the Border counties.  This project needs to be progressed.  Our motion also calls for investment in our regional airports and ports across the island, which will become more important in a post-Brexit Europe.  The reality is that &euro;26 billion of Irish exports were destined for the 26 other countries in the EU, excluding Britain, last year.  Getting these goods to the continent could become an issue if a hard Brexit occurs.  It takes approximately ten hours for a truck to travel between Dublin and Calais currently, using Britain as a land bridge.  If this route becomes unusable, whether due to restrictions, checks or massive queues at the Channel Tunnel, the alternative direct ferry route to Zeebrugge in Belgium will take 38 hours.  Any additional time in transit will cost businesses money, and when transporting perishable goods, every hour counts.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation about this yesterday, and inquired about the plans in place to deal with such a scenario.  Unfortunately, not much information was provided by the Government in this area.  The Irish Maritime Development Office is currently compiling a report into the use of land bridge and the alternatives that could be used.  This is welcome and I hope it is published soon so we can examine its findings.  Can the Minister provide a date of publication of that report?<\/p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, we should now examine whether IDA land could be used to set up large warehousing depots in Ireland to replace similar warehouses currently used by Irish companies in Britain, and the idea of using bonded warehouses in Britain.  If we are not prepared for a hard Brexit, it will have a devastating effect on Irish businesses, exporters and farmers.  Businesses need to know now what structures will be in place when Britain leaves the EU.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear the Tories are so fractured they will be unable to come up with a solution by October or March, and this makes a hard Brexit much more likely.  Should Britain crash out of the EU with no deal, air and shipping capacity in the short-term should be increased by the Government.  The infrastructure needs across the island are huge, and I believe it is a mistake to be putting hundreds of millions into a rainy day fund when so many vital projects are needed now.  We need to invest in these important projects now to help mitigate the problems that will arise for businesses and exporters due to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  I had not intended to speak about Fianna F&aacute;il, but it seems to be very touchy when any issues are raised.  It has come to the House with a motion, but it has no idea of how the proposals contained within it can be funded.  Fianna F&aacute;il wrecked the economy three times, including twice in my lifetime.  For that reason most people I went to third level education with do not live in Ireland any more; they emigrated when Fianna F&aacute;il collapsed the economy in the 1980s.  My nephews and nieces left when it collapsed the economy in 2008.  It is hard to listen to Fianna F&aacute;il; it wants everything and wants to pay for nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100035#NN00800","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1531320300,"counter":436,"content":"<p>This is a most timely motion, as the clock is ticking down to March next year, when the UK leaves the EU.  It is one thing to talk about the overall volume of goods and services traded between Ireland and the UK, and the possibility of Ireland finding new markets for some of its goods, but when we discuss the nature of the goods we export to Britain and the conditions of our ports and other infrastructure, we are faced with the stark reality that much more preparation work is required to ensure that our economy is cushioned against the inevitable negative impacts of Brexit.  The Minister for Finance reported earlier that 40,000 jobs could be lost in the event of a hard Brexit.<\/p><p>The new trading relationship between the UK and Ireland post Brexit will be more difficult.  Even if free trade with no tariffs or quotas is agreed, which is a tall expectation, there will still be paperwork created by the very fact that goods will be crossing in and out of the Union.  Whatever European red tape the British may have abolished by exiting the EU, they will have replaced it several times over with red, white and blue tape.  Analysis of the economic impact of Brexit carried out by Copenhagen Economics for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has projected lower economic output for Ireland by 2030 in every Brexit scenario.  In the least worst scenario, in which the UK remains in both the customs union and the Single Market, a possibility which has been ruled out, the impact would still be 2.8% of gross domestic product, GDP.  The worst-case scenario would rise to up to 7.7%.  These are shocking prospective figures and impacts on us.<\/p> <p> The same analysis also shows that wages would be lower for many workers by 2030, much worse than will be the case without Brexit.  Wages for low skilled workers could be between 3.5% and 7.7% lower.  Wages for highly skilled workers could be up to 6.5% lower.  These are the figures in the aggregate, but the direct effect on many workers will be the loss of their jobs.  Annually, Ireland exports &euro;15.6 billion in goods to the UK and imports &euro;18 billion.  Focusing on Britain alone, rather than just Northern Ireland, the most valuable exports are food and live animals, accounting for &euro;3.9 billion.  Chemicals and related products account for another &euro;3.9 billion.  Machinery and transport equipment account for &euro;2.6 billion, miscellaneous manufactured articles &euro;1.1 billion, and a range of other items amount to a further &euro;2.3 billion.  Practically all of these goods pass to Britain through our ports, and they do so alongside another &euro;100 billion in exports to other parts of the world, including &euro;60 billion in chemicals.  Alongside this, we import &euro;70 billion worth of goods through our ports, &euro;17 billion of that from Britain.<\/p> <p> Our ports are clearly central to our ability to export and to import.  If we are going to seriously open up new destinations for exports around the world, which is a strategic policy focus to combat Brexit, we need to be sure that our ports are ready to take up the volume and type of goods that would be involved.  It is not as simple as saying that we have to find new markets for every item that we currently sell to Britain.  It is more likely to be the case that significant restructuring will have to take place throughout the economy to shift the focus to export goods that are attractive elsewhere and will find alternative markets.  Not only will our producers have to consider making these changes; so too will our distributors.  We need to modify our distribution networks to be prepared for Brexit.  This is also an opportunity.  Britain accounts for only 14% of Irish goods exports, a remarkable fall from the day we joined the then Common Market.  As Ireland strengthens its capacity to export directly to continental Europe, and to the wider world, it has an opportunity to strengthen regional economic development outside of the Dublin region.  We are currently too dependent on Dublin Port as the main gateway into and out of Ireland.  In turn, Dublin Port is massively reliant on the Dublin Port tunnel, without which the city of Dublin would be reduced to gridlock by lorries.  The Dublin Port tunnel has a finite capacity to carry goods vehicles, which is another reason to plan for the development of ports outside Dublin.  As an island, it is also desirable to have some degree of competition between our ports, to give choice to exporters and to ensure that our ports are efficiently run and that we do not put all our eggs in one basket.  <\/p> <p> Given the major challenges in the global trading environment, we simply cannot be complacent.  Rosslare Europort is particularly well placed for this development.  It is the nearest port to continental Europe and it is strategically important for this nation.  The logic of that is simply that Dublin Port is hugely focused on shipping to Britain.  If we want to shift even a fraction of this trade to continental Europe, then we should develop the port that is nearest to those continental European markets.  It makes no sense for goods to be transported, for example, from across Munster all the way to Dublin only to be shipped south again, down the Irish Sea and past Rosslare Europort on their way to the continent.  That makes no sense at all.  It would lower carbon emissions if Rosslare Europort took this traffic.  As such, we should envisage upgrading Rosslare Europort becoming a tier 1 port in the same category as Dublin, Cork or Shannon Foynes, as opposed to its current position as the largest tier 2 port, followed by the Port of Waterford Company.  <\/p> <p> Rosslare Europort is currently operated by Irish Rail as opposed to a separate port company, a unique historical arrangement that, bluntly, is not working right now.  It remained profitable right throughout the downturn period, but it does not generate the return that would enable the major investment that is now required to upgrade it.  The needs of the port include dredging to deal with the silting caused by winter storms and lateral drift, modernisation of facilities that need upgrading, and general maintenance.  There is an argument for establishing a publicly-owned independent port authority for Rosslare to ensure a singular focus on maritime and shipping outlets.  That would be in the national interest.  Such an independent port authority could be formally linked to the local authority.  There is also a need for a region-wide plan to ensure that Rosslare Europort is fully serviced by the infrastructure it needs to expand the volume of exports and imports that it handles.  The Minister referenced the Enniscorthy bypass on the M11, which I was pleased to sign off on in my time in government, together with the New Ross bypass.  However, when it is completed in a few months - and I look forward to the Minister coming down to open it - it is going to end in the tiny village of Oylegate.  We need to complete the final phase of that as it was always envisaged, so that as was expected there is a motorway from Larne, right around the M50, all the way to Rosslare Europort and directly into the continent.  I urge the Minister to look at the completion of the M11 in that regard.  In the harbour itself, the access point down Delaps Hill is too narrow.  It needs to be upgraded with a new road network into it.  <\/p> <p> In the past two years, I have attended a number of presentations about Ireland's preparations for Brexit.  I am growing concerned that many of these preparations remain in the realm of conjecture and theory.  What we need in the coming months is an understanding of the pressures on the exporting and importing community in this country, and to look at the true assets we have such as Rosslare Europort.  We must give the port the infrastructure, management, selling and capital that it needs to ensure it can do the job for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100035#NN00900","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531320900,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Maltese Delegation","time":1531320900,"counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100036#OO00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1531320900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Before proceeding with business, on my own behalf and on behalf of the members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I wish to offer a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, a most sincere welcome, to Her Excellency Dr. Helena Dalli, the Minister for European Affairs and Equality of Malta, who is paying a short visit to Ireland.

The first point concerns the gaps in transport infrastructure.  We can acknowledge that gaps have to be addressed.  However, I will be parochial in my contribution because I want to make a few points about Dublin Port and the way it is facing the challenge of Brexit.  I represent Dublin Central and I live in a docklands community, so I am very aware of the work at Dublin Port, the plans and the way in which the port has expanded.  I am also aware of the employment opportunities that are offered there, the consistent growth and the development of the cruise ship potential.  Last year's review of the Dublin Port Masterplan 2040 included engagement with the public.  There were many presentations made on behalf of the Docklands communities.  A new capital project, MP2, has been proposed, and that is a progressive way of confronting the challenge of Brexit.  It would lead to greater efficiency in roll-on\/roll-off, ro-ro, lift-on\/lift-off, lo-lo, and passenger traffic.<\/p><p>There is also a community gain aspect to the MP2 project, which is similar to all of the projects being organised by Dublin Port.<\/p> <p> There is huge potential for Dublin Port and other Irish ports as the UK land bridge to access Europe is likely to be problematic.  The potential is in engaging with ports in other European cities, for example Holland and Belgium.  This work is in progress because they are viable alternate options, as the Minister noted in his amendment.  It is hard to believe suggestions were made to move Dublin Port to somewhere up in north Dublin.  That would be extremely costly, it would take a very long time and it would completely undermine the investment to date.<\/p> <p> I want to highlight the close relationship with the local communities, north and south of the Liffey, through Dublin Port's support for education.  It has scholarship programmes, it supports schools, there is the early learning initiative at National College of Ireland, various community events for youth and senior citizens and sports.  In the past few years, that support has also been for the arts, not to mention the way in which Dublin Port has been a venue for other events such as the tall ships.<\/p> <p> I want to mention the UNCTAD port management programme, which is a training of trainers for managers from ports in Africa and Asia.  I know the port companies are commercial entities, but I want to highlight the positive work in Dublin port, which is not without difficulties and problems but overall is progressive and positive.  It can be replicated in other ports and I heard what Deputy Howlin said.<\/p> <p> There is one particular omission in the motion and amendments, which is the potential for our canals, predominantly for tourism and leisure.  We need easier access for both along the two canals and greater co-operation between the authorities involved.  With the big picture we are looking at the major roads, but there is a time to look at the smaller roads and the neglect away from those main roads.  I make a particular plea for island communities due to the damage done through various storms and with regard to access to and from the islands to ensure sustainability of the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100036#OO00600","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531321500,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to speak and I thank Deputy O'Sullivan.  Brexit or no Brexit, this infrastructure should be have been in place down through the years.  The Minister may recall that during negotiations on the programme for Government one of the first things to be discussed was putting the west of Ireland into the TEN-T funding.  Alas, as per usual, the people who do not realise where the west of Ireland is did not even bother their - I will not say what - even looking to Europe to include it.  Currently we have Shannon Foynes Port, Shannon Airport, the Port of Cork, Cork Airport, Dublin Port and Dublin Airport.  Going right through the midlands and heading for the west of Ireland the Port of Galway was downgraded, Killala was not even put on the map and Killybegs has not been done.  This area does not have the infrastructure in place, especially if Brexit happens.  Do people from Mullingar to Castlebar to Westport not deserve a motorway in the same way as people do in Cork?  I welcome the Cork to Mallow road being done because it needs to be done.  I have heard about the M18.  When I came in here in 2014 it was announced in the budget and, lo and behold, last year it was announced again, even though the machine drivers were looking for jobs elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is the infrastructure deficit.  The Government talks about balanced regional development.  Rosslare Europort needs the whole shebang of customs infrastructure and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the event we cannot go through England.  Last week I spoke to people in business, the great people in small and medium-sized enterprises, when they brought in their foods.  A small and medium-sized enterprise that needs a certificate from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine waits eight or nine days, but a Larry Goodman-type tycoon can work away and it will be there on site.  If we are to help in situations like this we have to put the infrastructure in place.  It is in the programme for Government but it is not being done.  I would love to say a motion would do it but, to be honest about it, we will vote on a motion which will probably be won, but it is a feel-good factor because, by God, if the Government does not do it when it is in its programme for Government it will hardly do it for a motion.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot understand why the likes of the Port of Galway, looking out at the Atlantic and next stop the United States, has been downgraded to a category two port instead of bringing it up and making it a proper port.  One day I saw three cruise liners in Dublin Port, which held 13,000 people.  It was great.  The city was buzzing.  Would it not be great to do this in Killybegs, Killala, Galway, Cork or Rosslare?  It can be done in Foynes.  This is about what we call balanced regional development.  What is happening is all talk about what we will do but it is not done.<\/p>  <p>  The western arc has been talked about.  Once we jump off the M18 below Tuam we are back to an ordinary road so, in actual fact, the likes of Ireland West Airport Knock will struggle because, unfortunately, it does not have the road infrastructure in place.  From there we go to Letterkenny and on to Derry.  The UK has decided it will build a proper road from Derry to Aughnacloy and we could put a spur out to the M1.  People in Cavan and Monaghan are left out.  We have drawn a line from Limerick to the east to Cork with TEN-T infrastructure.  The way it has been done comes up along to Dublin and on to Newry and the rest of the country does not matter.  We do matter.  Someone might wake up sometime.  I heard a story a few weeks ago when the Taoiseach stated the money was not there at the time.  He was right that the money might not have been there at the time, but the Government was able to put a line from Navan to Dublin when, economically, there was no better business case for doing it than doing work in the west of Ireland.  The reason was we have people in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport who, once they go outside the M50, have no satnav with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100037#PP00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1531321500,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  We need to ensure that not only is Ireland's economic growth increasing but that it is spread equally across the country to areas such as west Cork.  Our ports, including the ports in Cork, are vital to our economic growth.  We need to maintain strong competitive transport links with the rest of the EU to secure Ireland's economic future.  Two thirds of Irish exporters use the UK land bridge to access Europe.  Brexit will have a huge effect on Ireland's ability to use this route for export.  We need to look at creating alternative export and import facilities in Ireland.  We have spoken about Brexit for quite a long time in the D&aacute;il and, to be honest, we are no further ahead today then we were more than 12 months ago when it was almost sorted and resolved, but every hour it changes.<\/p>  <p>  Up to now, the Government has failed to invest in Ireland's ports.  Without investment in our ports we will not be able to take advantage of the new economic opportunities that would increase our economic growth.  We look at the 2040 plan and we talk about what Brexit will do to it.  What the Government has envisaged in its 2040 plan for west Cork is scandalous.  There is absolutely nothing in it for the people of west Cork.  We have been overdependent on Dublin Port as an nation.  We need to look at other ports.  We need to improve funding for the roads to get to these other ports.  Poor funding to date has left some roads in a shocking condition.<\/p>  <p>  The , TEN-T, provides considerable funding opportunities for countries to improve their connectivity with the rest of Europe.  The previous Government chose to exclude key infrastructural projects in its submission to the TEN-T network, thus preventing these projects from receiving TEN-T funding.  The majority of these projects were located in the west of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Coming from west Cork I know only too well how important ports are to us.  In my constituency we have ports such as Bantry Bay, Castletownbere and Kinsale.  These ports need investment and their futures need to be secured by the injection of economic and infrastructural development.  The cruise liners coming into Bantry have been a major success over the past 12 months in particular and maybe a little longer.  I plead with the Government not to make the same mistakes as the previous Government.  It is vital these ports are supported through the uncertain times that lie ahead with Brexit on the horizon.  Very seldom do I hear about the effects that Brexit may have on Irish fishers and fishing in general.  Are European trawlers going to be chased out of UK waters if Brexit goes ahead?<\/p><p>If they are, we know well where they will come.

Brexit has an effect on so many matters.  As an island and a maritime nation, we know that serious focus must be given to our ports and, in particular, our ability to trade internationally.  Even in 2013, it was clear from the Government's report on competition within the Irish ports sector that inter-port competition appeared limited.  The report also found that ensuring competition between ports was especially important but we were lethargic about it.  These issues would remain of vital relevance, even if Brexit, which is now upon us, were not a reality.  According to the Irish Maritime Development Office, the sector is a key driver of economic growth.  It notes that, in 2016, Ireland's marine economy had a turnover of &euro;5.7 billion, 37% of which is attributable to the shipping and maritime service sector.  It is huge.<\/p>  <p>  The direct economic value of Ireland's marine economy was &euro;1.8 billion in 2016, representing an increase of 20% on 2014, which is to be welcomed.  According to the Irish Maritime Transport Economist report in 2017, a 2% increase in total port traffic in 2016 led to the highest level of throughput achieved since 2007.  Statistics for 2017 indicate continued growth, with shipping and port activity in the Republic of Ireland rising by 7% in the first quarter of 2017 when compared with the corresponding period in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The ports sector is one of those parts of our economy that often play a very muted and undervalued role in the national public conversation.  It does not have the slick appeal of technology giants or other multinational sectors but we know that without a ports sector and strong and resilient port infrastructure, the loss to our trading capacity would be catastrophic.  That is why it is imperative that serious and sustained consideration be given to protecting it from any adverse impact from an increasingly disconnected Brexit strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Rosslare Europort is dear to me but we will not now see a road developer from Limerick to the east.  Connectivity between Rosslare and the rest of the country is very important.  I am sad to say that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was here but before any of us rose to speak, he fled like snow off a ditch in case we might ask him a hard question about his policy on roads.  He knows nothing about roads or ports and could care less, unless he fell into one somewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100038#QQ00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1531322100,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important matter.  We do not know what will happen with Brexit and neither does the Minister of State.  We need to be ready and ensure that our ports, including Rosslare, are up to scratch.  The customs process must also be ready in order that we can still trade with the UK if it still wishes to trade with us.  Likewise, the roads infrastructure leading to our ports needs to be upgraded.  I know one road where articulated lorries pass me daily on the way to Castletownbere.  The road going from Kenmare to Lauragh is in a desperate state.  Going back a number of years, my father got funding for a part of it but the Cork side back to Castletownbere is only fit for two donkeys and cars to pass each other.  That is the truth.  It is not fair on the lorry drivers trying to negotiate the roads with loads of fish.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Boxer Moran, who visited us in Kerry this time last year.  There is a slip on the road to Fenit and following his visit, the Minister of State allocated &euro;176,116 just to deal with the slip and ensure the road stays open.  We thank him very much for that.  Liebherr uses the port at Fenit around the clock and if that company is to continue trading with Britain, that port must be improved.  All of Kerry depends on Liebherr for employment and if anything happened so it could not export through the port or a delay was caused, it could mean many people would be out of work.  The entire economy of Kerry would fall asunder if Liebherr did not have the facility available in order to trade with the UK if it goes outside the European market.  It is a consideration that must be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  The roads leading to our ports, such as the road to Fenit, must be upgraded for the massive volumes of traffic using it every day and night.  It is how people operate.  We welcome the money we got from the slip but the roads must be further upgraded to facilitate the vehicles of today.  There is much work to be done and I hope the Minister of State is listening to us.  It is serious for the bit of employment we have in Kerry.  We are trying to hold on to the employment we have because we do not seem to be able to attract new employment to the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100038#QQ00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1531322100,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies O'Keeffe and Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100038#QQ00400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1531322100,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We all know two thirds of Irish exporters use the UK land bridge to reach continental Europe and in certain sectors the UK is an especially important market, not least for the agrifood sector, where over 40% of our exports are destined.<\/p>  <p>  Given that trade costs will increase in all scenarios post-Brexit, it is really important that we look at alternatives and also look to invest significantly in our ports infrastructure.  It is not just about the upgrading of our ports and we have been told by the Irish Road Haulage Association that up to &euro;180 million is the estimate in losses arising from delays; every truck movement in a post-Brexit scenario will cost in excess of &euro;40 per hour per truck.  I have had communications from the chief executive of Drogheda Port, who has told me it competes with ports in Northern Ireland, where they are certainly getting Brexit-ready, while our ports are not.  He told me the port needs massive State investment to provide the necessary infrastructure.  It is happening on the Northern side of the Border but it is not happening here.  We need to help ports like that in Drogheda, which is a very important public asset, with the necessary infrastructural development.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is familiar with my constituency and the road haulage sector is a major industry there.  On the Cooley Peninsula alone, there are over 300 trucks serving the North-South corridor.  Those people need reassurance and assistance.  I would go as far as to say there is a need not just to invest in ports but to look at creating a third section of road on the M1 corridor in order to get people into the various ports along the east coast.  Irish ports must receive the needed investment to accommodate modern, larger ships and offer swifter and more efficient services to continental Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Our Government must be strong in demanding more investment through the TEN-T programme, as was mentioned already today.  Brexit gives us the reason and the impetus to demand investment now rather than wait for the next review.  The European Commissioner for Transport has stated, with reference to Brexit, that extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary actions.<\/p><p> Finally, Greenore Port in my constituency, a privately-owned port, is strategically placed close to Warrenpoint Port in the North.  I have suggested previously that we should look at a special economic zone for that area.  Given that one port will be in the British jurisdiction and the other in the Irish jurisdiction we should have some form of strategic hub with bulk bonded storage in the lough.<\/p> <p> I must give way to my colleagues.  We need to consider the ports in use in my county, the rat runs being used and the need to ensure the trucks stay on the major routes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100038#QQ00600","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531322700,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Regardless of the result of Brexit, Ireland's economy is going to be damaged.  We have to respond.  The outline of the UK Government white paper does not suggest a particularly soft Brexit.  Under the proposals, the UK would still leave the customs union.  There would still be different tariffs on goods for the UK and Ireland.  There could be different regulation for many of those goods.  The UK would not be part of the Single Market for services or the free movement of people.  As such, it is not at all clear that Ireland will in future retain full and free access to all the UK's transport networks and the critical land bridge.<\/p>  <p>  The result of all this ambiguity and complexity is increased risk for Irish jobs and trade.  In that context, it is imperative that new high quality transport routes between Ireland and mainland Europe are developed.  The trans-European transport network, TEN-T, programme is exactly the type of funding Ireland should be leveraging to develop these routes.  Violeta Bulc, the EU Transport Commissioner, has stated clearly that there is an opportunity for Ireland and the Government to push for, and succeed in, instigating a review long before 2023 with a view to drawing down some serious funding for investment.  One relevant route is the rail link between Dublin, Rosslare and through Rosslare Europort.  The route goes through my constituency of Wicklow.  Right now, the rail link is creaking at the seams in terms of transport and commuter services.  Every week constituents contact my office about it.  The carriages are full.  The frequency is not what it needs to be.  Irish Rail has said it will be years before it can get the new carriages to put on that line as well as increase frequency and capacity.  Moreover, significant new work is required on coastal protection for some of the required upgrades.  TEN-T funding could help upgrade the rail link, strengthening the land bridge with mainland Europe, supporting Irish jobs, supporting Irish trade and providing the commuter services required.<\/p>  <p>  The Brexit clock is ticking.  We are rapidly running out of time.  I hope the Government will move quickly to instigate a new review for this funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100039#RR00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1531322700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is not here.  Anyway, the big message is that the Minister needs to get more proactive in the Department with regard to infrastructure development.  This morning, we learned of the requirement for a second runway at Dublin Airport to be fast-tracked and the delays pending in that regard.  If Brexit comes about, obviously we will have fewer people flying into London and maybe more into Dublin.  Are we ready for that?  I do not think we are.<\/p>  <p>  I will stick to the South in my deliberations.<\/p>  <p>  The applications made to Europe under the TEN-T programme were deficient.  Let us consider some of the applications.  Major emphasis was put on the upgrade of Rosslare, which is a project badly needed.  We know what will happen if the land bridge through Britain is closed down to us or made too restrictive for hauliers and the movement of goods.<\/p>  <p>  As recently as 12 months ago, the Government acknowledged that no report was in hand with regard to exactly what goods were going via the land bridge through Britain.  Even the Taoiseach acknowledged that the Government had no statistics in place.  The Government has put them in place since then, in fairness, but that was one year after Brexit was passed by the British people.  Whether Brexit comes or otherwise we do not know, but we should have contingency plans in place.  We do not know what the Government has in place.  This is causing fear in people currently.  One person gave me an example only last week.  During the warm weather there were upwards of 35 tankers parked outside Bulmers in Clonmel.  The question was whether those 35 tankers would be held up at the port if Brexit comes about.  There are implications for customs tariffs and so on down the road.<\/p>  <p>  We need infrastructure to be upgraded.  I remember when I first joined my local authority, Cork County Council, in 1997 or 1998.  I remember the Southern Regional Assembly.  One of the major priorities was the trans-European transport network, which involved a motorway from Cork, via Waterford, to Rosslare and up the east coast through Dublin into Belfast.<\/p>  <p>  I have referred to the N25.  There are no major proposals in the Government development plan for the N25 to be upgraded.  This is concerning because considerable emphasis will be put on the adjoining ports for the delivery of goods.  What is the shortest direction to mainland Europe?  Will we have to get bigger ferries?  We hear nothing about this.<\/p>  <p>  It took the Minister six months or more to acknowledge the need for the M20 for economic development from Cork, Limerick, Galway and all the way up as far as Derry via Donegal.  I wish to focus on the section from Cork to Limerick.  I approached the Department 12 months or more before the Department acknowledged that the route had to be direct from Cork to Limerick with no roundabout route.  There was talk about going through Clare and joining the proposed motorway from Limerick to Waterford.  That made no economic sense and would have affected the people of the west considerably, including those in Kerry and west Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge infrastructure has costs.  However, the development of infrastructure has economic benefits in the long run.  The Minister of State will know from her area in Meath that there must be development in order to see an economic return, whether on a local or national scale.<\/p>  <p>  The concern is that not enough is being done in fast-tracking developments for infrastructure in this country.  We seem to be far behind.  I will offer one example.  I attended an international transport conference recently.  One issue that came up related to road safety and the reduction of road fatalities.  The aim was to reduce road fatalities by 30%, although the figure may vary.  Anyway, I asked whether it was fair to have Ireland in the same category as Sweden and Germany.  Those countries have better infrastructure and road networks while we are lagging behind.  The speakers acknowledged that it was difficult for us to catch up and meet the target of zero fatalities as quickly as the other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100039#RR00300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1531322700,"counter":457,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Government I thank the Deputies for their contributions on Ireland's transport network and the importance of maintaining and enhancing our connectivity with the rest of Europe, especially in the context of the UK departure from the European Union and Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  While I share the Sinn F&eacute;in concern about Brexit implicit in its countermotion, the Government will not on this occasion be supporting that motion.<\/p>  <p>  As mentioned by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in his opening statement, the Government is addressing the challenges posed by Brexit and will continue to do so.  This includes addressing the implications on the connectivity of our ports and airports and access to them.  This approach and the mitigating actions required will obviously evolve as the negotiations between the EU and UK progress.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Government has laid out an ambitious infrastructure investment programme in Project Ireland 2040, spending billions to tackle the infrastructure deficits throughout the regions and mitigate the potential challenges posed by Brexit.  This includes the commitment to the A5 and other aspects mentioned in the Sinn F&eacute;in countermotion.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has tabled a countermotion.  I wish to reiterate that the EU trans-European transport network is a Europe-wide network of roads, railway lines, inland waterways, inland and maritime ports, airports and railroad terminals.  The network is made up of the comprehensive network and a subset, which is referred to as the core network.  The core network is the most strategic part of the transport network.  In Ireland's case, it runs from Belfast to Dublin to Cork and includes the core ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of an element or section of a country's transport network or county transport network on the TEN-T core network does not result in automatic qualification for EU funding for transport infrastructure projects located on this network.  It means that such projects may apply for funding under competitive EU-wide calls.  These calls remain considerably over-subscribed.  Where such projects are successful they may obtain 20% or perhaps 30% of EU co-funding with the remainder of the required funding coming from either the Exchequer or private sources, depending on the nature of the project in question.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, pointed out in his opening statement, there is an obligation on EU member states to complete their respective elements of the pre-defined TEN-T core network by 2030.  When the TEN-T regulations were being negotiated in 2011 it was not possible to include all elements of our island's transport network on the TEN-T core network.  This was because of our financial and economic circumstances and taking into account the EU planning methodology, which specifies the requirements and thresholds that must be met for areas to qualify for core network status.<\/p><p>That is not to say that many of our transport projects have not benefitted from this source of funding and there are a number of excellent examples where this has been and continues to be of crucial importance in the successful delivery of our transport infrastructure. <\/p> <p> Thus far, 19 successful Irish projects have obtained co-funding of a total of &euro;58 million for projects located on the core TEN-T network that either have or will improve our connectivity with the rest of Europe.  This includes funding for our core ports.<\/p> <p> Most recently, the port of Shannon Foynes was successful in obtaining funding of 20% of projects costs, or &euro;4.4 million, from the EU, which will assist the port in further improving its capacity, thereby removing a bottleneck of shipping and goods in transit at the port.<\/p> <p> This Government has committed to further developing our regional transport infrastructure and Project Ireland 2040 will enhance regional connectivity and accessibility.  The national planning framework and the national development plan both recognise the importance of the Atlantic economic corridor.  The Government is working to ensure that Ireland is not negatively affected by the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, including our continued use of the UK landbridge.  New shipping routes connecting Ireland to continental Europe may also emerge as markets respond to Brexit.  We are already starting to see that happen in my own county where businesses, including agrifood, are looking to explore new markets.  Only this morning, Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia informed us that many businesses with which they engage are starting to explore new markets.  We expect that new shipping routes would open up in response to this.   <\/p> <p> As set out in the EU&rsquo;s TEN-T regulation, the core TEN-T network shall reflect evolving traffic demand and the need for multimodal transport.  The implementation of the core network is to be evaluated by the European Commission by the end of 2023 and the Commission will then evaluate whether the core network should be modified to take into account developments in transport flows, as well as national investment planning.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will, in line with the commitment contained in the programme for partnership Government, coupled with the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU and as a consequence the EU&rsquo;s TEN-T network, make a submission to the European Commissioner for Mobility and Transport seeking an early review of the TEN-T network.  This submission will take into account the impact of Brexit and the investments that will be made under Project Ireland 2040, particularly those located in the north west of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100039#RR00400","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531323300,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to address the status of our railway lines and ports and the need to apply for EU funding for our railway lines by applying for special designation for the railways.  This special designation is known as TEN-T status.  TEN-T is an EU-supported transport programme that provides funding for designated transport networks including railways.  I will focus on the Belfast to Rosslare railway line and Rosslare Europort.  The railway runs parallel to the roadway, designated European route E01, which runs from Belfast to Rosslare Europort.  It is a critical access way for goods and passengers to gain direct access to the Continent, to which I note Rosslare Europort is the closest port.  Currently, the Belfast to Dublin section has TEN-T status, but critically that does not continue to Rosslare Europort.<\/p>  <p>  As Members are aware, 80% of the volume of goods leaving Ireland for the Continent use the UK landbridge.  In almost all scenarios of Brexit, this landbridge will be lost or significantly restricted or will become financially unviable.  Tariffs, quotas, customs checks and tolls will all significantly hinder the route via the UK landbridge.  Our freight and road hauliers will need alternative access to the Continent especially for agrifood, perishable goods and pharmaceuticals.  These should not only be for the goods that are currently supporting our jobs but also to help gain access to new markets.  <\/p>  <p>  There must also be an alternative to Dublin Port.  Not a day goes by when this Chamber does not hear of the traffic chaos in Dublin and on the M50 but the only plan in the event of a hard Brexit seems to be to load everything through Dublin city into Dublin Port.  We see no plans to develop Rosslare as an alternative.  Rosslare Europort, which makes a profit of &euro;2.5 million profit per annum, is owned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, which sees it as little more than a cash cow to be milked dry.  Instead of reinvesting the profits into the port, they are withdrawn to subsidise other parts of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Rosslare Europort needs to be designated with tier 1 status.  It must be taken from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and put into ownership of a stand-alone company.  The railway line south of Dublin should be designated with TEN-T status to ensure the port and the railway lines are viable.  We need to do this in the interest of the entire country to soften the impact of Brexit, protect jobs and open new markets.  The opportunity and potential are there but where is the will of the Government to make it happen?  Only recently, the Secretary General of the EU Commission, Martin Selmayr, told MEPs that he was developing funding for an alternative shipping route to the Continent in order that Ireland can have access to the northern ports.  That must be investigated and introduced.  However, in terms of roll on-roll off, RoRo, ferries and haulage to the Continent, Rosslare is the only game in town.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100040#SS00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1531323300,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for co-ordinating this debate on the impact of the TEN-T decisions taken some years ago by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.

We are now two years into the Brexit process and not only does the UK Government not have a plan but neither does the Minister or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, particularly to address the fact that two thirds of Irish exporters use the UK as a landbridge to reach continental Europe.  We know there will be uncertainty and a blockage but we do not know what the Department is doing about it.<\/p>  <p>  The remarks made this evening by the Minister, Deputy Ross, did not reflect any ambition or thinking outside the box on how to deal with this, which is what we need to see.  We need to see the Atlantic economic corridor, referred to by the Minister of State here, fleshed out in practice.  Ireland West Airport Knock needs to play a comprehensive and driving role.  The Government needs to engage with the strategic development zone planned around it to ensure there are proper facilities and industrial bases to drive that.  The western rail corridor offers a unique opportunity to bring rail connectivity to the Atlantic economic corridor.  The ambition and perseverance of those promoting the western rail corridor is in direct contradiction to the lack of interest shown in the project by the Minister, Deputy Ross.  That economic and the rail corridor in particular have the capacity to deal with our climate change challenges by taking traffic off our roads, away from towns and villages and putting it on rail, as most European countries do.  A proper, ambitious application under TEN-T would give us the chance to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier, the Minister, Deputy Ross, told the House he did not believe the infrastructure in the west was as neglected as we say.  I invite him again to join me on the N26 between Swinford and Ballina, a so-called national primary road, which has been forgotten about by Fine Gael.  He could join me on the R312 between Belmullet and Castlebar and, in particular, join me in the back of an ambulance on that journey, which many people must undertake.  It is incredibly stressful and difficult.  It is damaging the economic potential of an area the size of County Louth.  The Minister needs to get with the programme and to understand and share the ambition of groups along the west coast, such as Claremorris Chamber of Commerce, which has been highlighting the opportunity under TEN-T for many years.  The Minister and the Government need to show us and the west of Ireland that it has an ambition for us and that its words about an Atlantic economic corridor and Project Ireland 2040 are more than words but that there is certainty behind them.  An application under TEN-T would show that.  Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary actions.  That is the quote the House has heard all evening from the Commissioner, Violeta Bulc.

It may be open in ten years.  Representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, have come before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on a number of occasions.

Our exporters need greater security.  The Government is failing abysmally in this regard.  I mention as an example what the Minister is doing regarding Dublin Airport.

When he came before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport this morning, we learned - lo and behold - that the Department of the Taoiseach is now involved.

I was pleased last December when the Government announced that eligibility for a GP service without fees was to be extended to everyone who receives a carer's allowance payment.  Following further examination of the proposal, the Minister for Health confirmed in April that this measure should also be extended to people who receive carer&rsquo;s benefit.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide a general medical and surgical service free of charge to people who receive half-rate or full-rate carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  The Bill will result in approximately 14,000 additional people being eligible for a GP visit card, thereby enabling them to access vital GP services without having to consider their ability to pay for this service.<\/p><p>We all agree that carers are the backbone of the caring profession in Ireland.  Their selfless dedication to providing hours of unpaid care to their loved ones and families is a major contribution to the provision of care in every community.  Each caring role is different.  Becoming a carer is a life-changing experience.  It can be sudden for some carers, while for others it happens gradually over time as the care needs of their loved ones increase.  For some carers, the time spent caring is a period of weeks while for others it lasts a number of years.  Despite these differences, all carers begin the journey for the same reason.  They are motivated by their love for the person they are looking after and the need to ensure they are provided with the necessary care and support they require.<\/p><p>The contribution of carers to our society is measured as part of the census.  According to the 2016 census, more than 195,000 people, or 4.1% of the population, provide unpaid assistance to others.  This represented an increase of more than 8,000 people since the 2011 census.  A total of 6.6 million hours of care is provided each week, with some of this care being provided on a 24-7 basis by family members or unpaid carers.  As the census figures have shown, there is an ever-increasing need for care.  This need, which is being met by unpaid carers, can be expected to increase as our population continues to grow and the proportion of people living longer continues to increase.  The CSO projects that the population aged 65 and over will increase by 59% by 2031.  The number of people living to the age of 85 or more is forecast to increase by 97% over the same timeframe.<\/p><p>While the number of persons living longer is something to be celebrated, we must acknowledge that it is likely to place further demands on family members and friends to undertake caring roles.  Studies emanating from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing have shown that more women will be caring for dependent children and elderly parents while also playing a more active role in the workforce and that this generation will become more relevant as our population continues to age.  The impact on the health and well-being of carers is likely to increase as more and more unpaid care is provided by family members and loved ones.  Therefore, the provision of a free GP service is another important step by the Government to provide much needed supports to carers.<\/p><p>I would like to reflect on the development of the first national carers strategy, which was published by the previous Government in 2012.  It recognised the significant contribution and commitment that family carers make and the concerns they face.  The strategy sets the direction for future policies, services and supports provided to carers by Departments and agencies.  When I reviewed the strategy recently, I noted that its vision statement reads:<\/p><blockquote>Carers will be recognised and respected as key care partners.  They will be supported to maintain their own health and well-being and to care with confidence.  They will be empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.<\/blockquote><p>I am sure Deputies will agree that the measure we are debating supports carers in maintaining their health and well-being and caring with confidence.<\/p><p>General practitioners, GPs, provide support and assistance to carers in managing and maintaining their health and well-being.  We are all too aware of the various health impacts suffered by carers, including the physical strain on their bodies and the associated mental health impacts.  General practitioners also play a vital role in assisting the carer to care.  General practitioners are valuable resources who have excellent knowledge of the supports and services available to carers in a locality.  This is why we want to extend access to GP care for carers.  While many carers might in theory have access to GP care, that care may not always be accessible due to the financial barriers carers may face.<\/p> <p> Carers often have to reduce their hours of work or even give up work entirely but, although this is often done unselfishly, it does place a financial burden on their shoulders.  Removal of this barrier and the introduction of free GP care to an additional 14,000 carers will therefore prove to be a significant benefit.  Some 14,000 carers will benefit from this legislation.  Carers' financial worries or anxieties regarding their ability to pay for this service will be eliminated.  Instead, they will have access to high-quality GP care centred on their needs, which will ensure their own health does not deteriorate, particularly as we know that their health tends to do so gradually as their hours of caring increase over time.  The HSE has indicated that carers will be able to apply for a GP visit card from 1 September 2018.  Applicants will be facilitated to make either a paper application or an online application.<\/p> <p> This measure is just one of a series of measures introduced in recent times to aid carers.  As Members are aware, there were successive &euro;5 increases in social welfare payments for carers in budgets 2017 and 2018 and an extension from six to 12 weeks for the continuation of these payments after the death of a cared-for person or that person's entry into residential care.  This has gone some way towards easing the financial burden on the shoulders of carers.  Last December, additional investment in respite care services, of &euro;10 million, was announced.  This will enhance the provision of respite care to people with disabilities, enabling more carers to take a break from the daily caring routine.  It will provide them with much-needed time to maintain their own health and well-being.  These actions reflect the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to have a stronger voice for carers.  We have listened to carers and have taken positive actions to address their needs.<\/p> <p> I will now outline in general terms the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides the relevant definitions to the Health Act 1970 and the Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014.  <\/p> <p> Section 2 provides for an amendment to section 47 of the Health Act 1970 in order that the HSE's appeals process can be extended to encompass this service.  <\/p> <p> Section 3 provides for an amendment to section 47A of the Health Act 1970 in order that the HSE's current \"ordinarily resident\" framework is extended to cover the provision of a general practitioner medical and surgical service for persons in receipt of carer's benefit or carer's allowance.  <\/p> <p> Section 4 provides for a new section 58D in the Health Act 1970 to provide in law for this new service.  Section 4 of the Bill contains the text of the new section 58D, which has five subsections.  Subsection 58D(1) provides that the HSE shall make available without charge a general practitioner medical and surgical service for persons in receipt of carer's benefit or full or half-rate carer's allowance.  Subsection 58D(2) requires that persons in receipt of the carer's benefit or full or half-rate carer's allowance, furnish any necessary documentation the HSE requires from applicants to establish if they are, or continue to be, eligible for this new service.  Subsection 58D(3) enables the HSE to deem persons in receipt of carer's benefit or full or half-rate carer's allowance who do not furnish the necessary information required as not eligible for the service provided under section 58D.  Subsection 58D(4) provides that the HSE, insofar as it is practicable provide a choice of GP for the services provided under section 58D.  Subsection 58D(5) provides that in \"Act of 2005\" means the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  <\/p> <p> Section 5 provides for the Long Title and Short Title of the Act and relevant commencement provisions.<\/p> <p> All of us will be touched by caring at some point in our lives, whether we take on a caring role or need care ourselves.  For me, this Bill is about looking out for people who spend their time looking out for others.  Caring for those in need provides a major contribution towards health and social care in Ireland.  Our Government recognises the major contribution carers make to the welfare of others.  We aim to strive for a society that respects, values and supports carers.  The needs of carers are being considered across Government and I hope we will receive cross-party support on this important legislation.  I am personally very pleased to introduce this legislation.  I would like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of enacting it before the summer recess in order that this service can be in place for carers in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100041#TT01200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531324500,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Michael Moynihan and Deputy Brassil.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the extension of GP cards to all carers and will be supporting this Bill.  The Bill proposes a modest extension of the GP card to an additional 14,000 carers and this will be very welcome to every single one of them.  It is very much deserved.  It is estimated that carers provide approximately 7 million care hours every week, saving the State approximately &euro;10 billion in unpaid care every year.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware of the sacrifices families make while caring for their loved ones.  This Bill goes some way towards recognising those sacrifices and supporting the individuals.  We need to go further than this Bill, however.  We need to address the 6,500 older people waiting on home care and home help at present.  That represents an increase of 19% just since last December.  In the west and north west, the issue is particularly bad, with targets missed by more than 100,000 care hours just in January, February and March of this year.  We must increase home care supports if we are to meet the demand.<\/p>  <p>  We need to ensure that all carers receive a GP card.  Family Carers Ireland has pointed out that even with tonight's measure, there are still carers who can be identified by the State as carers who will not be covered.  I have tabled an amendment to address this.  We will talk about it on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Those in receipt of the carer's support grant, formerly known as the respite care grant, and who are not in receipt of the other payments will not receive the GP card based on this Bill.  The good news is that the money should be in place.  It has already been set aside to allow the extension to those in receipt of the respite care grant or carer's support grant.  As the Minister of State knows, the Minister, Deputy Harris, stated some time ago when he initially started talking about this that &euro;11 million would be set aside.  It turns out that when the Department calculated its numbers, significantly less than &euro;11 million was required.  I understand that approximately &euro;2.5 million will be required on foot of this Bill for those in receipt of the carer's allowance and less than half a million euro will be required to cover those in receipt of carer's benefit.  The information we have is that the provisions in this Bill will cost approximately &euro;3 million.  Critically, we were told that approximately &euro;11 million had been set aside when the idea was initially floated.  The obvious question is whether it was the initial intention, when the idea was floated, that those in receipt of the carer's support grant would already be covered.  The Government will be required to run the numbers in the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have taken a look at some preliminary figures.  It seems extending the GP card to those on the carer's allowance, which we support, to those in receipt of the carer's benefit, which we support, and to those in receipt of the respite care grant or carer's support grant who are not already in receipt of one of the other two grants could be done and that the cost still would be significantly lower than &euro;11 million.  We will be supporting this Bill.  It is a move in the right direction.  It recognises the important work of carers.  It will come as very welcome help for the 14,000 carers.  I would like to talk to the Minister of State about extending coverage to the other group also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100042#UU00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1531324500,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, I welcome this Bill.  There are three issues I want to raise.  The Minister of State referred in his opening remarks to the additional investment of &euro;10 million for respite care services.  There is a chronic crisis in respite care.  We were told about the extra money coming in.  I have worked closely with families to try to get respite for carers, particularly those caring for people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p><p>I was informed yesterday morning by senior executives in the HSE that there is no money, even for the clients who have been deemed to be a priority by the service providers.  It does not have any money for respite care or for the shared care scheme.  That must be examined.  Given all the fanfare with which it was announced last year it is simply not good enough.  Families are in crisis as a result.<\/p> <p> It is estimated that &euro;10 billion is saved due to people working as carers for loved ones in their homes.  A huge volume of work is done in that regard and we do not give enough credit to people for it.  As regards the home care packages and home helps, a circular has been issued by the HSE to various people working in the home help services stating that no holiday cover will now be given.  It is withdrawing all holiday cover during the summer months.  In previous times when a home help was going on holidays the person could get a colleague to cover.  I pay tribute to the significant work being done by home helps throughout the country.  My family has had the benefit of home help services for many years and I cannot say how grateful we are as a family, in the first instance, and as a community for the benefit of that service.  A directive has now been issued from the HSE and as a result there is no holiday cover available if somebody takes annual leave, as a person is entitled to.  This is putting families and the people in receipt of home help in a crisis situation.  It is deplorable and must be examined.  If we are serious about dealing with people who need these services we must ensure the services are available.  The enormous service the home helps and carers are giving the State is not being given the proper recognition it is due.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on those three points regarding respite care, home helps and carers in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100042#UU00300","speaker":"1283","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531325100,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I welcome the introduction of GP cards for carers and people on carer's benefit.  It is another step towards the overall goal, which Fianna F&aacute;il supports, of free GP care for all.  However, that will not be achieved without the negotiation of a new GP contract.  I hope that this modest expansion of the service is being done with the agreement of the GPs and that there is capacity in the system to absorb it.  Last April the Minister intimated that the negotiation for the new GP contract had started.  There has been zero progress since that announcement.  The negotiation of the contract must get off the ground and over the line before any further progress can be made on the advancement of primary care.<\/p>  <p>  The issue I wish to highlight is home care packages and people hoping to receive those packages.  Carers getting a medical card is a great advance but, currently, in CHO 7, CHO 3, CHO 4, CHO 5 and CHO 9 no home care packages have been given since last January.  I have been in contact with people in CHO 7 due to the fact that I am friends with them.  There is little point in a Deputy from any party putting in a request in CHO 7 for a home care package because it will not be given.  What is even more ridiculous is that CHO 6 is alongside CHO 7 and in some cases the geographical areas are separated by a road, so one side of the street is CHO 7 and the other is CHO 6 and if one is on the other side of the street one will get a home care package.  I am reliably informed that there are 12 families looking for palliative care home care packages in CHO 7 and they will not receive them.  This information is accurate; I am not being sensationalist.  It is a huge issue.  Deputies send in repeated representations seeking home care packages but none has been given since last January.  The Minister of State can check; that is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome this positive development, I ask that the GP contract be negotiated and that home care packages be allocated to the areas that currently have none.  Finally, will additional staff be appointed to deal with the 14,000 applications that this measure will generate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100043#VV00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1531325100,"counter":484,"content":"<p>This Bill is welcome, but it does not go far enough.  We have put forward an amendment, which I will discuss later.  The Bill represents progress on the current situation so my party will support its final passage, hopefully this evening.<\/p>  <p>  Carers in Irish society are unsung heroes.  Spouses, siblings, children, extended family members and, in some cases, friends or neighbours all act in caring roles for those who are close to them and in need of around-the-clock care.  They deserve our respect, compassion and support.  They perform a most unselfish role, in many cases leaving their careers behind and putting their lives on hold.  As a society we too often take carers for granted, particularly our Governments which are obliged to provide the required financial resources and fail to do so time after time, so we must collectively step up to the plate and ensure that the best supports we can provide are in place for both the cared-for person and the carer.  To provide carers with free access to GP and surgical services, if required, by way of a GP card is certainly welcome.  However, I do not believe this measure goes far enough.<\/p>  <p>  We submitted an amendment to address the deficiency in the Bill.  We believe carers should have been given access to the provisions delivered by a full medical card.  That, at least, is their due.  Our amendment, therefore, called for \"drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances\" to be provided to carers along with general practitioner medical and surgical services.  We were most disappointed that this amendment was ruled out of order both in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il.  This was due to it putting a cost on the Exchequer.  Of course it would, but it is a cost we should bear.  I have submitted a parliamentary question to determine exactly what the additional cost would be but, unfortunately, this has not yet been answered.  I do not believe it would be a huge cost.  Perhaps the Minister of State might have the figure to hand.  That said, the Minister for Health should have taken this amendment on board.  Not to do so is mean-spirited on the part of the Government and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this additional provision in the short term.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports a full transition to universal healthcare for all our citizens.  We need an national health service that is free at the point of entry, delivers healthcare from the cradle to the grave, is provided on the basis of need, not means, and is funded by progressive taxation.  The Fine Gael Party supported this concept in 2007.  It was in its famous, now seen as infamous, five-point plan. <\/p><p>Fine Gael Ministers for Health have since come and gone, including the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and Senator James Reilly.  When Minister for Health, the Taoiseach scrapped these plans.  The problem with Fine Gael&rsquo;s plan was that it involved privatising our health system through insurance contributions.  It was selling off our health practices to the highest for-profit bidder, leading to higher and higher prices for patients through premiums.  This plan was flawed.  Sl&aacute;intecare has recommended a universal single-tier health and social care system where everyone has equitable access to services based on need and not ability to pay.  This is the correct approach.  My party supports this model of healthcare delivery and has advocated it during my more than two decades as a Member of this House.<br\/><br\/>What is the status of Sl&aacute;intecare?  There is a fear that civil servants are watering it down, picking out what they believe are the best bits and shelving other parts.  We will not accept this.  The cross-party committee will not accept it either and the people we represent certainly will not accept it.  In planning for universal healthcare, we should be transitioning as many qualifying people as possible to full medical cards.  There cannot and should not be any half or bit-part medical cards, no GP-only cards or any other watered down provisions.  Had the Minister accepted our amendment, it would have been a serious start on our journey towards universal healthcare.<br\/><br\/>I again raise the<i>in loco parentis<\/i>clause, which I have been raising for the past few months.  It remains as pressing now as when I first raised it in March.  Twenty-four-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week carers, primarily the parents of very sick children, remain seriously inhibited by the enforcement of this clause by the HSE.  As stated by Lynn McDonald in a &quot;Prime Time&quot; documentary in March, these parents are virtual prisoners in their own homes.  This continues to be the case and it is in no way acceptable.<br\/><br\/>In the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion on disabilities on 27 March last, taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, we called for <i>in loco parentis<\/i>to be immediately abolished.  The motion in question was supported unanimously but nothing has happened since.  I raised the issue again the following day, 28 March, under promised legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, said he and an official from the Department of Health would meet me to discuss the matter further.  This meeting took place on 26 April.  In the interim, I raised the issue at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  I have since written again to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on 21 June seeking an update only to receive the following most disappointing reply, not from the Minister of State but on his behalf.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Dear Deputy O'Caolain<br \/><br \/>I wish to acknowledge receipt of your recent correspondence in relation to the above.<br \/><br \/>You will appreciate that while Minister Daly facilitated your meeting with [a named official from the Department of Health], the issue does not actually come under his remit.<br \/><br \/>I will, however, forward your letter to [the named Department of Health official] while cc'ing the Minister Harris' office.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has responsibility for disability.  The response to which I refer is simply not good enough, particularly for those suffering families that are seeking a resolution to this problem.  There are, I have learned, different degrees of application of the clause in terms of enforcement across different CHO areas.  We need to seriously examine this with a view to removing the clause entirely.  That would be my view as to what should happen.  I am, therefore, seeking a detailed reply from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, as to what will be done to alleviate this most unnecessary further difficulty for parents who, as he knows, are already coping with enormous challenges.  That is no exaggeration.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to record that Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill.  However, we are disappointed that it has not been a more generous provision for those in receipt of carer's benefit and carer's allowance.  This particular cohort of people are deserving of full medical cards with all that these would entail and I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to this proposal in the shortest timeframe possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100043#VV00300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531325700,"counter":486,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I am delighted to have the opportunity to support this Bill.  I thank Deputy Alan Kelly for allowing me to replace him in doing so.  Most Deputies will know that I have been a strong champion for carers for the past 26 years.  I have done a lot of work in this area and that will be recognised by people on the ground.  The Labour Party wholeheartedly welcomes the extension of eligibility for a GP service without fees to persons in receipt of a carer's allowance payment, although we believe that they should be given full medical cards.<\/p>  <p>  In the course of our study, we found that very often a carer ends up in poorer health and in a worse position than the person for whom he or she is caring.  In 2002, when I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I initiated a review of the aids and assistance available to carers across the country.  I had seen the work being done by very elderly people in looking after other elderly people, people with disabilities and young children with varying degrees of infirmity.  These people were deteriorating before me eyes and this motivated me to ensure that their lot would be improved and that we, as an Oireachtas, would take this matter seriously.  The committee sought submissions, oral and written, and it received 103 from, among others, Care Alliance Ireland and the Carers Association.  The committee chose to draft the report rather than employ consultants to do it because, when let loose, all consultants want is to do is collect their &euro;40,000 fee and so on.  With due respect to Deputy Donnelly, we should rid ourselves of consultancy involvement in Oireachtas work.  I would dump them and thus save a lot of money. <\/p>  <p> The report to which I refer was handwritten by me in one month.  It contained 15 recommendations, only seven of which were implemented.  We are all aware of the many reports that are lying around gathering dust.  The most seminal recommendation in the report was that carer's allowance at 50% of the personal rate should be paid to people in receipt of qualifying social welfare payments.  We broke the taboo that people said could never be broken, namely, that no person could be in receipt of two social welfare payments at once.  I am very proud of that achievement.  I will not contest the next election, so this will serve as a memento of my time in this House.  Everybody said it could not be done.  The late Seamus Brennan was Minister at the time and I was agitating from the Opposition benches.  I was always agitated and I did more jumping up and down than Deputy Paul Murphy does these days.  The late Seamus Brennan told me that if he agreed to what I was proposing, it would open the floodgates.  My response was that if the floodgates opened, so be it.  This was, and remains, costly but it is only a small token of recognition in terms of the that work carers do.  They are the unhung heroes.  They work night and day and we exploit and abuse them and take them for granted.  We should be collectively ashamed.<\/p>  <p>  If I had a bundle of additional money, this is the area to which I would direct it.  I would abolish the means test for carer's allowance in order that people would no longer have to be constantly filling out forms.  There are 200,000 recognised carers in Ireland but there are many people who did not register as carers on their census forms, which means that the number of carers is probably closer to 350,000.  There are carers as young as 16 and 17 years of age who are not recognised and I am acutely aware of that.  If we were to pay carers the minimum wage, it would cost us in excess of &euro;5 billion.<\/p><p>We have got them on the cheap.  Talking about exploitation, we are paragons of virtue as exploiters here.  We have effectively abused them.  We should significantly increase the carer's allowance in the budget whenever we get to the stage and abolish the carer's allowance.  It is an objective I have championed since I was first elected to this House.  Some people might say it is far too much but let us think what would happen.  What would happen if the carers of Ireland downed tools?  We already have crises with accident and emergency departments, inpatient services, community hospitals and nursing homes.  If they downed tools it would make what we have now look like a picnic.  The whole health system would just capsize and collapse overnight.  Let us recognise what they do and have done.  We all know we can do much more for them.<\/p> <p> Some 14,000 people will benefit from this provision, which is great.  It is like how the snail got from Mullingar to Dublin - by degrees.  We will acknowledge and accept every little improvement.  However, there is more to be done to use that awful slogan of a political party many years ago.  I would say a small bit is done, but there is a bucket-load more to do.  No Government of any hue has ever properly recognised the Trojan selfless work of these carers.<\/p> <p> I know thousands of carers in my Longford-Westmeath constituency and the work they are doing.  I know the work that people like Caroline Poole, Denise Nolan and Ann Quinn do.  I have met them and spoken to them.  I have always fought their cause and always will until I leave this place.  Even when I am gone, I will remain a very strong advocate for their cause because it is just and right.<\/p> <p> The HSE gives organisations such as the Carers Association in Longford and Westmeath peanuts to survive.  They are dependent on voluntary donations.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will remember the Classic Showband.  Every August Billy McCauley, a local musician who used to be with the old Classic Showband, has a big Carers Association fundraiser in the Greville Arms Hotel, kindly sponsored by Christy Maye and others.  All the top bands across the country come and provide a great night's entertainment to raise money.  These organisations should not be reduced to having such fundraisers.  They should have a core grant to enable them to carry out their tremendous work in advocacy and providing various things to carers across the area, such as pendants for people living alone.  They do a lot of work on the protection of vulnerable people in isolated areas.<\/p> <p> I am preparing a Bill that I will introduce in September - I am giving Members adequate notice.  If it is the last thing I ever do it will be important.  It is the carers need assessment Bill.  I will be seeking to put this on a statutory footing.  There will be no more grace and favours for carers.  They will be statutorily entitled to various matters.  Let us get this straight.  Let us stop doing the grace and favour that we hand out some small thing to them and think it is a great achievement.  It is, but let us put it on a statutory footing.  From my dealing with carers, I know they are very often under strain.<\/p> <p> There were 15 recommendations of which seven got implemented.  One of them was the payment of the respite care grant, which is now called the carer's support grant.  The name is not important; it is the &euro;1,700 that arrives that is the important thing.  One has to be there in June; it specifies dates and all of that.  That now goes to people who are not in receipt of carer's allowance.  There is almost an investigation beyond investigations to try to prove things in respect of people.  The point is that it is &euro;1,700 for somebody looking after a person to be able to pay for two or three weeks' respite care.  Let us just imagine the cost - we are paying &euro;900 or &euro;950 down in the midlands, it could be &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,500 here in Dublin for nursing home care for a person.  Let us look at the balance of the equation and the amount we are saving by paying the carer's support grant for people who do not get carer's allowance.  We are paying &euro;228 or whatever it is for carer's allowance.  I know it increased by &euro;5, which is gratefully accepted, but more needs to be done.  If we were to pay even the minimum wage, it would be the guts of &euro;400 and we have them for just over &euro;200.  That is only over a 39-hour or 40-hour week.  Those people are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week without respite.<\/p> <p> This morning I spoke to one of them who is looking after his elderly mother and trying to do a bit of part-time farming while being full-time devoted to his mother.  They are the heroes.  If we ever do an honours list, we do not want lords, ladies, Bonos or anybody else.  We should collect up the 250,000 or 300,000 carers of Ireland and give them all an honour and salute them.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, would want that.  Those are the people we should put on a pedestal.  They do not look for anything or claim to be great.  They are great without ever looking for anything and we should acknowledge that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100044#WW00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531326300,"counter":488,"content":"<p>We support the Bill.  We support providing carers with access to medical cards but it is peanuts compared with the extent of unpaid labour of the estimated 360,000 carers, as Deputy Penrose said.  For that reason we support both the amendments that seek to widen access and seek to widen what carers would be entitled to.  All of it pales into insignificance compared with the unpaid labour of care, of social reproduction, of those who primarily - two thirds - are women.  The 360,000 carers represent 10% of the adult population and that figure is only going one way.  It is expected to be 20% of the population by 2030 according to Family Carers Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Care Alliance Ireland produced an estimate of the unpaid labour of those carers based on paying them the living wage of close to &euro;12 an hour.  It estimated the total saving on behalf of the State is &euro;10 billion a year.  That is an incredible amount of free labour done by people caring for either elderly relatives or young relatives - children, grandchildren etc.  As I mentioned it is feminised with two thirds of carers being women.  That increases to over 70% in the 50-plus category.  The other feature is that the age profile of carers is getting older with a 50% increase in the number of older carers since 2006.<\/p>  <p>  The way carers are treated appallingly relates directly to cutbacks and the absence of investment over the past ten years or so in the context of an increasing need for carers.  It also relates to a broader societal issue.  The structure of capitalism is such that it relies on a huge amount of free labour taking place which is overwhelmingly done by women.  The impact on carers' lives, financially, emotionally and health-wise is obviously immense.  In Ireland 66% of carers have said they struggle to make ends meet.  One third of carers still keep a job outside their role as a carer to maintain themselves financially despite the fact that the average hours worked by a carer in Ireland is 44.6 hours a week.  They are doing a full-time job or more caring and then they need to work outside of that to simply survive for themselves and possibly for the person for whom they are caring.  In many cases it is not 44.5 hours a week; in reality it is 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of that is immense.<\/p><p>Apart from the financial strain on people working for free, 50% report feeling emotionally, physically and mentally drained from the role and pressure of being a carer.  Over half reported physical injury, usually to their back, and another half reported mental health problems due to the role and stresses related to it.  In the context of a society that does not provide appropriate public care, people wonder about what will happen to the people they care for and love.  They wonder if they die or get sick, who will look after the people they are caring for.  As a result, 27% of carers have a stress level of seven or higher on the care-giver strain index.<\/p> <p> We support the Bill.  We will seek to strengthen the Bill by supporting both of the amendments on Committee Stage.  There is a much bigger and more fundamental change needed here in how care is provided in our society and an end to the reliance on unpaid labour, generally of family members.  We need increased supports for home helps as part of a national health service.  We need more quality residential facilities.  We need more home help provided as part of a properly funded public service.  We need full financial support for those who have to be carers.  They need to be paid a living wage.  We need to make funding available for home adaptations.  We need support for minority care givers; 12% of carers do not speak English, which affects their ability to access the services available to them or which are available in theory to them.  We need support for Traveller caregivers and LGBTQ+ caregivers and so on.  Fundamentally, we need an end to the direction of travel of our health service towards privatisation.  We need the development of a proper national health service within which the role of carers is properly resourced, publicly provided wherever possible and, where not possible, that carers are appropriately remunerated for the jobs they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100045#XX00200","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531326900,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to speak on the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2018.  I thank the Oireachtas library and research service as usual for its fine analysis of the Bill and on its information on the key issues for carers.<\/p>  <p>  It is a very short but important Bill.  Throughout my career, I have tried to advocate as strongly as possible for carers and believe the tireless, unpaid work they do in large part still goes unnoticed and unappreciated by the State.  Almost 20 years ago, when I was the social welfare spokesperson of the Labour Party, I published a paper entitled Caring for Our Carers, setting out a list of basic supports for carers which I believed at that time were very badly needed.  Many of those supports still have not been delivered by successive Governments, including this one.  One of the areas we covered at that time was the introduction of carer's benefit which was a very tiny step forward.<\/p>  <p>  Census 2016 showed there were over 195,000 carers across the country, which was an increase of 4.5% on the 2011 census figures.  Of these, as other speakers have said, just over 60% were women and almost 53% were in the 40 to 59 years age group.  One of the most shocking figures in the analysis is that 3,800 children under 15 were providing care for a family member and almost 1,800 over 85s were also providing care, which was an increase of nearly 35% since census 2011.  That brings home to us the situation that members of families often find themselves in.  It is particularly poignant when elderly people and young children have to perform this crucial function.<\/p>  <p>  As other speakers have said, the number of care hours per week was estimated, at full-time job levels averaging 38.7 hours per carer, at 6.6 million hours of care per week in total.  Almost 43% of carers provided around two hours per day and almost 17,000 carers were providing full-time, 24-7 care.  The figures available for June 2018 show there were 2,747 recipients of carer&rsquo;s benefit and 77,384 recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance and that 83% of these recipients already have access to free GP care through access to a medical card or GP card.  The Bill before us is expected to extend this care to a further 14,000 carers at a full-year cost of approximately &euro;2.8 million.  The Bill will provide for this extension by amending sections 47 and 47A of the Health Act 1970 and by inserting a new section 58D.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is the only health system in the EU that does not already offer GP care universally.  Hopefully this shameful situation will end over the next number of years, either in this Administration or the next, as Sl&aacute;intecare is implemented.  It is regrettable, after the all-party approach of the committee, which included a number of Deputies all around the House under Deputy Shortall, the Government seems to be dragging its feet on the implementation of the programme.  We may have made some improvements in that regard since the extension of GP care to under sixes but it is disappointing to see the Bill will not include those 29,869 carers in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s support grant, which is the new name for the respite grant.  Will the Minister of State explain why he did not ask for funding to extend it to those recipients given many of them are giving many hours of care per week to loved ones?<\/p>  <p>  Carers experience a huge amount of stress and are more likely than the general population to become ill.  According to the Department of Health, 27% of carers over 50 have reported high levels of stress and distress.  The toll that caring takes on a person&rsquo;s physical and mental health cannot be underestimated.  Deputies know that very well because week in and week out we meet people who give an extensive part of their lives to caring for their loved ones, an older person or a child, or an adult of any age who has a serious disability or illness.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 of the Bill provides the insertion of section 58D, which I mentioned earlier, allowing for persons in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s benefit or carer&rsquo;s allowance to avail of a GP medical and surgical service.  The Minister of State mentioned in his address to the Seanad on 5 July that section 4 included persons in receipt of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance yet the informative Bills digest, which the library and research service prepared for us, tells us it is not explicit in the Bill.  Perhaps it is something the Minister of State addressed in his opening statement.  I was attending the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight and did not get a chance to hear it.  Will the Minister of State confirm in his reply whether persons in receipt of the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance will also receive a GP visit card?<\/p>  <p>  According to the library and research service&rsquo;s excellent work, the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in Part 3, Chapter 8 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 uses the term \"a payment under section 186A\" throughout and this Bill before us makes no reference to \"a payment under section 186A\".  Is the Minister of State looking into this to ensure they will not be excluded?<\/p>  <p>  Other important issues arise.  What consultation did the Minister of State and Minister have with GPs?  The EU average number of GPs per 100,000 people is around 91 yet Ireland has the far lower ratio of 64.4 GPs per 100,000 citizens.  It is also reported that many of our trained GPs leave the country for opportunities outside of Ireland, mirroring trends of other health sector personnel, and it is estimated there will be around 26.2 million visits to GPs per year by 2031 due to demographic changes.  Given this welcome Bill, do we need to offer new opportunities to citizens, particularly those from lower income backgrounds, to train as GPs and to give strong encouragement to work in Ireland?<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that may arise with the Bill is related to data sharing and GDPR.  Due to the nature of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit, there will be monitoring of recipients' eligibility for those payments and therefore, by extension, eligibility for the GP card.  The primary care reimbursement service administers this system and monitors eligibility but there may be data protection issues around sharing this information for the GP visit card.  The Minister of State might come back on that.<\/p>  <p>  National carers' week took place last month from 11 June to 17 June.  I commend the work of all the advocacy groups such as Family Carers Ireland and others for highlighting the need for carers&rsquo; roles and contribution to the State to be recognised.  The interesting points about carers, as Deputy Penrose and Deputy Murphy have said, is that virtually all of us will be cared for and all of us are, have been or will be carers.  It is something every citizen understands.  I echo the comments of my two colleagues.  There is a deep-seated wish that carers are properly valued by the carer's allowance, the respite grant and all the other supports we can get them.<\/p><p>It can often be an isolating and tiring time and carers deserve to know that the national carers&rsquo; strategy 2012 will have resources put into it, so that their lives will be improved and they are supported.  I hope the Minister has plans to update it in the current legislation.  He may know that I am a member of the informal disability group of this D&aacute;il and Seanad, as is Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, and a proposal has come forward from the committee for an additional programme of &euro;211 million for supports for citizens with a disability, which would be helpful to carers as well.  I hope the Minister will strongly advocate for this at the Cabinet table and demand that kind of money in budget 2019, and does not have to come into the House to tell us he only got &euro;35 million or &euro;45 million.  It was a well-structured exercise to lay out the improvements we need in disability services and &euro;211 million is a basic price tag across Government.<\/p> <p> I welcome this Bill, I join with all our society in thanking carers for the work they are doing and I am delighted to be supporting the Bill.  I hope that budget 2019 will bring some further improvements in supports and packages available to carers and I urge the Minister to put forward such requests to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohue, without delay.<\/p> <p> There have been a lot of reports of over 70s contacting offices about the removal of medical cards, possibly on income grounds, and being given a GP card instead.  A lot of people are upset about this and about what may be happening to the limits.  It is not directly related to what we are talking about now but the Minister may examine the issue to see if there is a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100046#YY00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531327500,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Many people might remember last December, watching in horror the RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" programme, \"Carers in Crisis\".  We saw thousands of people all over the country dedicating their entire lives to looking after loved ones who were unable to care for themselves.  In many cases, carers themselves were in ill health.  Becoming a carer for a loved one is a life-changing experience.  Each day brings new demands, new highs and new lows.  On average, carers care for their loved ones for almost the equivalent of a full 40-hour working week and almost 9% provide full-time, 24-hour unpaid care with no break at all.<\/p>  <p>  While there are many positive and rewarding aspects to caring it can also place huge physical and emotional demands on carers, who try to balance their own well-being with the needs of those for whom they care.  I welcome the proposal in this Bill to provide general medical and surgical services free of charge to people who are in receipt of either carer's allowance, at the full rate or the half rate, or carer's benefit.  This Bill will result in approximately 14,000 additional people being eligible for a GP visit card.<\/p>  <p>  In December last year, my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and I brought forward a home care package motion in which we highlighted the wonderful work of our carers and the fact that they are hugely restricted and unable to receive any respite care for themselves.  Our motion called for the Government, and our Minister with responsibility for elderly people, to increase home help hours so that an efficient service could be provided to older people and that our carers can be given the support they need.  A total of &euro;10 million for respite care services was announced in last year's budget and I welcome the announcement.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is a step in the right direction but more can be done for our carers.  The home help service is not getting any better and in my constituency people looking for home help are being told to advertise to see if people are available.  The home help people are telling me they are quite willing to put in extra hours but they are not being given the hours.  It is a total con job of a system and the people in charge of this have to be made accountable in the D&aacute;il for it.  If there are people who are willing to do home help hours but are not being given them, the people who are refusing to give them are conning sick people and home help people.<\/p>  <p>  Being a carer can have financial consequences and many carers have to reduce their working hours or give up work entirely.  Carers can go five, six or seven months without any payment, which is nothing short of outrageous, and the first day it is proven by medical evidence that a loved one requires care, a social welfare payment should be made to the carer.  We need to ask who cares for the carers.  There is no doubt that many deserve acknowledgement, understanding and support.  This Bill is a step towards getting the recognition they deserve and the support they need to maintain their own physical and mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1531327500,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I welcome the approval of a GP card for our carers.  It should be a full medical card on account of the great work they do.  Many are family members who give up their jobs and their time to care for their parents or other relatives who would have no one else to care for them and they get little respite or time for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Collins.  The home help service is 30 minutes and when family members in Kerry ask for a second home help they cannot get one.  It takes two trained people to operate a hoist and some patients are very fat at that stage so it is a total no-no.  Many families pay for home help out of their own pockets.  There is no home help on Saturdays, Sundays or bank holidays, apart from in very rare cases.  Sick and elderly people do not get better for the weekend or a bank holiday.  They need the same attention and care for seven days as they get for five days.<\/p>  <p>  When carers apply for funding to be a carer they have to wait for 12, 14 or 18 weeks.  Live horse and you will get grass, and grass is very scarce at the present time.  The wait is too long.  Another thing that is happening is the removal of medical cards from elderly people.  I do not know who authorised this but they are looking for all sorts of information from people as old as 85 or 86 who have had medical cards since they got to pension age.  Will the Minister explain what is happening?  Why is there such a shortage of funding and why are we taking medical cards away from these people?  Nobody can understand it.  Reviews are being done into people's circumstances and I know one man aged 89 who had a medical card but does not have it now.  He has gone through the hoops to get it back but he has to pay for his drugs and whatever he needs to take on a weekly basis.  It is very unfair on old people who have served the country well and brought it to where it is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1531327500,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I welcome this announcement by the Minister, even if it is several years overdue.

He had other political priorities occupying his time.  So be it.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal to extend free GP coverage to those in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit is part of a phased expansion of coverage to different groups and that is something that can also be broadly welcomed.  We note, however, that since the introduction of free GP cards for the under sixes there have been chronic problems with accessing GPs.  The Government was warned about that but would not listen.  That action was not targeted at those in most need.  If it was targeted it could have been used to provide access to additional kinds of care requirements.<\/p>  <p>  I said to the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor as Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, at the time of the introduction of free GP cards for the under sixes, that it would escalate the pressure being experienced by GP surgeries across the country as they struggle to adapt to the implementation of the scheme.<\/p><p>The National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, confirmed to me that at the time, the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, did not even engage in the minimal courtesy of consulting its 1,450 members about the plan.  That must be a lesson he passed on to the current incumbent as Minister, Deputy Harris.  It has rubbed off on the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, as well because he is not too good at consulting either.  It was a case of not consulting GPs, just ordering them to do the work.  As has been said by many Deputies, carers up and down the country are boundless in their energy and in what they do and try to do for their loved ones.  The way they have been treated and mistreated by being cut down to half an hour or even 25 minutes in some cases is ridiculous.  We must recognise them.  I recognise the carers in Tipperary, as well as their manager, Councillor Richie Molloy, for all the work they do.  <\/p> <p> Instead of 2,954 GPs, we need 4,264 to have any kind of a service.  Statistics provided by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, for Tipperary found that carers provide a staggering 250,000 hours of care per week within the county.  That is in Tipperary alone.  These findings also record that 7,041 people stated they provided regular unpaid personal help to a friend or family member, as has been mentioned by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and others, with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  Without the carers, there would be even more chaos than there is now.  A woman in University Hospital Limerick contacted me today.  She has a serious diabetes issue and has been on a trolley for 80 hours.  What is going on?  If we did not have the carers, the volunteers and the families, there would be utter chaos but the HSE cannot see that.  It is all about offices and mandarins, rather than supporting people on the ground. <\/p> <p> What is deeply alarming to me is that the CSO found there were 138 carers aged under 15 years in County Tipperary alone.  I have asked the Taoiseach for reassurance that this will be investigated.  They would not be allowed to work for Deputy Danny Healy-Rae because they would be underage but it is fine to let them care for people in their own homes.  That is shocking and is an abuse of children.  They should be out playing with other kids, going to matches and doing their schoolwork and not having the worry of trying to care for their loved ones.  The explanatory memorandum accompanying this Bill estimates that this measure will have a full year cost of &euro;2.8 million.  Of that, &euro;2.4 million is for those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and &euro;400,000 for those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  We must have that.<\/p> <p> Details provided in the Revised Estimates for public services showed that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission was allocated &euro;6.5 million in 2017, with &euro;3.5 million of that going toward salaries, wages and allowances.  There it is, those are CSO figures and that is where the money is going all the time.  There are managers and more managers and line managers, as well as renting office space but not looking after the people who, as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, built this country.  They should be recognised in their final years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, had a lot of talk when he was sitting over here on this side of the House.  He was going to do everything but he has done little to help, including people with disabilities.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100047#ZZ00600","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531328100,"counter":498,"content":"<p>What am I doing today if not delivering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100048#AAA00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1531328100,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I join with other Members in welcoming the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2018.  It is a small but important measure in recognising the exceptional work that carers do.  Many Members have referred to the outstanding work done right around the country by people caring for their children, elderly parents, partners and other people.  It is done in a manner that is first and foremost about love for the person for whom they are caring and we see so many people devoting, in many cases, their entire lives to this role.  They take it on willingly but there must be a recognition that in doing so, family members taking on the caring role are not only doing an extraordinary job for the people for whom they are caring - their loved ones - but they are also doing an extraordinary job in the saving they help to make for the State.<\/p>  <p>  If a person requires full-time care and attention and has to go into a nursing home or other kind of facility, the cost is extraordinarily high.  That always has to be the yardstick by which investment in carers is measured.  The truth is we do not do half enough to recognise the work carers do because it is exceptional and very generous of them.  It is done with an open heart but it needs to be recognised properly and we need to go much further than this Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a need to ensure that training is provided for people in full-time caring roles.  It is a specialised job to care for somebody who is immobile, such as an elderly person or a person who needs much lifting and handling.  Carers very often do themselves serious injury by trying to cope with a situation like that and we could be doing much more in providing training in patient handling for people who are caring.  We could also do much more to make aids and appliances, things like hoists and housing adaptations, easier to access.  Funding for those services, aids and appliances is limited and very often, people must go on long waiting lists to avail of them.  I hope in the run up to the budget that the Minister of State will make a strong case for increasing the funding for aids and appliances.  I refer to items like ramps, grab rails and so on, as well as the need for walk-in showers and downstairs bathroom facilities etc.  <\/p>  <p>  That applies to people in private housing.  When it comes to people in social housing, the lists are much longer and it is much harder to access those aids and appliances.  There is a need to look at this again.  I, and I am sure many other Members, have come across cases where a person, generally an elderly person or a person with a disability, is prevented from coming home from hospital and being cared for at home simply because there is inadequate funding for those kinds of grant schemes.  For want of a ramp, rails or downstairs bathroom facilities, people often have to stay in a hospital bed, which costs about &euro;1,000 a night.  If a small amount of money is provided to make the house more accessible, that person could come home and be cared for there.  Joined-up thinking is needed between local authorities and the HSE.  That is not going on at the moment and there is a real disconnect.   <\/p>  <p>  On the granting of carer's allowance, there has to be a relaxation in the application of the habitual residency rules.  This is a major problem now, as Irish people are living longer and many people can expect to live into their 80s and 90s.  That is fantastic but the reality is that not everybody can live into their 80s and 90s and be fully mobile, healthy and free from debilitating illnesses.  On a fairly regular basis, we see cases where the son or daughter of a man or a woman has emigrated to the United States, the UK or wherever.  That elderly parent is becoming less mobile and wants to stay in his or her own home but needs to have somebody looking after him or her.  When the son or daughter comes home to look after the elderly parent, he or she is refused social welfare support because of the habitual residency rules.  They are applied very tightly and very strictly and that needs to be looked at.  <\/p>  <p>  The other thing on which we need clarification is the point raised by Deputy Broughan.  We need the Minister of State to clarify that this provision of GP visit cards will apply to people in receipt of the half-rate of carer's allowance.  It is not clear from the legislation.  It also will be important to ensure that adequate funding is provided for the Carers Association.  It is an extremely difficult job caring full-time for a person who is infirm, elderly or with a disability.  People need regular breaks, regular support and psychological and moral support.  That often comes from the local Carers Association, which can meet with people that might organise sessions where carers can come together and share their concerns, as well as get advice and a break etc.  That can only happen adequately if the Carers Association is funded properly.  We need to make sure that we are caring for our carers.  <\/p><p>Very often they are left to care in isolation without the kind of supports necessary to enable them to continue to do their important work.<\/p> <p> While I welcome improved access for carers in terms of access to free GP services and the extension of that facility to under sixes that has taken place in recent years, and indeed the additional work that will come to GPs as a result of the repeal of the eighth amendment, I note that GPs are expected to do a lot of extra work.  At the same time recruitment and retention of GPs is becoming increasingly difficult and for primary care staff generally, including public health nurses, therapists, speech and language therapists and so on.  The provision of adequate health services at community level is now a huge challenge.  The aim is full implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which not only proposes a universal single tier health service with much greater access to health care, but also a new model of care, where we would move away from the hospital-centric model of care we have at the moment towards the provision of more and more services in the community.  This is particularly the case when it comes to the management of chronic illness, which accounts for 70% to 80% of healthcare activity.  Conditions such as asthma, diabetes and COPD should be managed locally in the primary care setting.  They can be managed much better there.  We get better health outcomes and much better value for money if we provide services in the primary care setting rather than in the expensive acute hospital sector.  That can only be done if we have capacity at primary care level.<\/p> <p> Many GPs are opting to go abroad to work in systems that are functioning better than ours, where they are treated better and where there is certainty about the future of the service.  The financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts, which took place a number of years ago and which amounted to 38% of the income and practice supports of GPs, have never been reversed, unlike the cuts endured by every other public sector worker.  Those cuts have been reversed, or at least those affected are on a path to reversal.  That has not happened for GPs.  The cuts they faced have not been reversed at all and we are paying a price for that in terms of the loss of GPs.  Of course, it is also the case that GPs want to work within multidisciplinary teams and in premises provided by the State.  Unless the Government addresses these issues and faces up to the crisis in general practice we are now facing much of this talk will be academic.  Carers or other people will not be able to get access to GP services.  That is the real challenge ahead and it is a challenge the Government is currently ignoring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100048#AAA00300","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531328700,"counter":501,"content":"<p>The Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2018 seeks to extend GP visit cards to those in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefits.  It is welcome.  The announcement that this legislation was to be brought forward was accompanied by an additional &euro;10 million funding for respite care.  I welcome the focus on the issues that carers face.  However, Ireland has the only EU health system which does not offer universal cover for GP care, which is disappointing.  The Government has promised to improve support for carers and it has to honour that.  The 2016 figures show that 45% of the population receives free or subsidised GP care via medical cards or GP visit cards.  The proposal to extend free GP coverage to those in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefits is part of a phased expansion of coverage to different cohorts.  While GP card eligibility was initially solely based on means, it has been extended to all children under six and all adults aged 70 or over.  I welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  This proposed legislation will grant the GP visit card to some 14,000 carers.  This represents the 70% of those in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefits who do not already have free access to GP care.  As of June 2018, some 77,384 people received carer's allowance and 2,747 received carer benefits.  The vast majority - some 83% - of this combined population already have access to free GP care as they satisfied the existing qualifying criteria for medical cards or GP visit cards.  Figures from the census of 2016 show that there are 195,263 carers in the country.  This legislation will bring a new entitlement to free GP care to some 70% of carers.  GP visit cards, while granting free access to GP care, differ from medical cards in that they do not provide access to medication, aids or appliances, or a whole range of pioneering social care services to which medical cards facilitate access.  People with GP visit cards remain liable for all other charges, including public healthcare levies for non-medical card holders.<\/p>  <p>  Evidence indicates that carers have poor mental and physical health outcomes, so extending free GP care to carers would be of particular value to them.  The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill estimates that this measure will have a full year cost of &euro;2.8 million, comprising &euro;2.4 million for those in receipt of carer's allowance and &euro;400,000 for those in receipt of carer's benefit.  The 2016 census recorded 195,263 carers providing 6,608,515 hours of care each week.  That is an average of 38.7 hours of unpaid care per carer.  This represents 4.1% of the population, which is the same proportion shown in the census of 2011.  The majority - 60.5%, which is 118,151 carers - are women and over half of all carers - 52.7% - were aged between 40 and 59.  The greatest proportion of carers was in the 50 to 54 age group, accounting for 28,700 carers, or 14.7%.<\/p>  <p>  Many people come into my constituency office and ask what is the carer's allowance.  The carer's allowance is a payment made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to people on low income looking after a person needing full-time support because of age, disability or illness.  If a carer is in receipt of certain social welfare payments and is providing full-time care and attention for another person he or she can retain his or her main social welfare payment and also receive a half-rate carer's allowance.  I am also asked what is a carer's benefit.  It is a short-term payment, for up to 24 months, for people who give up employment to care on a full-time basis for someone who requires full-time care and attention.  Carers do not work for the money.  They have a vocation.  The big problem I have is that many people come into my constituency office looking for carers.  These people go to a GP and are told that they are entitled to carer's allowance.  When I look at the medical report the GP gives that person I know that it is not sufficient.  We have to be honest with these people.  A large amount of time and effort is put into the application form for carer's allowance.  The Department always asks for more information.  We find that TDs have to send the information.  We can scan the information and look after it.  The Department just goes back and forth with the carers.  The amount of money carers have saved this country is unbelievable.  It is not about the money for those people; it is a vocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100049#BBB00200","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1531328700,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill.  Providing a GP medical card is a step in the right direction.  I emphasise the word \"step\".  However, I believe we need a total re-examination of the way carers are treated.  Every one of us across this floor has put in applications or helped people with their applications.  The process is very cumbersome.  It might take three or four months, and longer if it goes to an appeal - possibly six, seven or eight months.  That is a long period to wait for an outcome.  I have seen cases, especially in rural parts of Ireland, where a potential carer might have a piece of land and the adjudication might be that the person spends time on the land so he or she could not care for the person.  We must realise that morning, noon and night, these people are being cared for.  The carers might go out and do a bit of work outside for half an hour or an hour, but they come in again.  A person then makes the decision at the stroke of a biro to disallow the application.  That is one thing we need to look at.<\/p>  <p>  A problem can arise where a husband and wife are working and because of the love for his or her family, for a mother, father, son or daughter, one of them gives up work.<\/p><p>Then they must go through an assessment of means and all that craic.  Does the State not realise that if they took the easy option for their loved ones they could go through the likes of the fair deal system, and a nursing home would cost the State more than &euro;206 or &euro;208 a week?  Anybody who gives up work to look after their loved one should have these issues sorted out regardless of what their husband is earning, because they are causing terrible problems.  Someone might give up a job and then they might be refused carer's allowance.  They may have kids going to school.  That puts a ferocious financial strain on them.  Putting someone into a nursing home, as the Minister of State knows well, costs between &euro;850 and &euro;1,200 a week.  The carers throughout this country are the greatest servants of this country, with the hours they put in, their patience and what they do for their loved ones.<\/p> <p> Carers can also be neighbours that come in and help people.  I know that the Minister of State does not have the money to do everything.  However, in the upcoming budget, I ask him to do whatever he can to assist the carers and make their lives easier.  I ask him to be mindful of those people, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters, who have given up work and all their time to make sure that they look after their loved ones, rather than see them go somewhere they might not want to go.  In fairness, I know that he is looking at the fair deal system, which I appreciate.  It is badly needed.  I thought it was to be before Government yesterday, but I do not think it was.  It needs to be brought forward as quickly as possible.  I ask the Minister of State to change that situation.  Every one of us in the House sees people being turned down.  They are doing the work; they are helping their loved ones morning, noon and night, and they are doing this State a massive service.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100049#BBB00300","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531329300,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  When it comes to carers and acknowledging the work that they do, we should be willing to provide whatever facilities or help we can give them, whether it is medical cards or any kind of assistance.  It would be wrong to speak on this important motion without acknowledging the work that is being done by our general practitioners throughout the country.  In the county that I represent our local GPs play a vital role.  As we are talking about the subject, I am very worried about the future of our GPs.  In rural areas, many of them find it hard to keep their businesses going, even though they are so pivotal and important.  From a monetary point of view, it is getting more difficult to run a business, which is what being a local GP is.  It is getting more and more difficult with overheads, insurance and everything becoming so expensive.  They are finding it very hard.  I worked diligently to ensure that in places like Waterville and Sneem we had GPs to replace excellent people that had given a lifetime of dedication, which was important.  I do not want to see any place with a GP service in the county that I represent lose that service.<\/p>  <p>  Coming back to the carers, a colleague behind the Minister's back said correctly that being a carer is not a job, but a vocation.  It is giving a service and saving the State an absolute fortune.  If at all possible, the best place that our elderly people can be, whether they are our family, friends, relatives or neighbours, is at home, receiving the care that they require.  In situations where people cannot stay at home, I also want to acknowledge the work that is done by our community hospitals and private nursing homes.  Again, private nursing homes find it very difficult.  They operate to the highest of standards, but the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is a moveable feast.  It raises the bar this high today and raises it that high the next day.  It has certain rules today and a completely different set of rules some other time.  We all accept and respect that we have to have standards, but HIQA is a runaway monster.  It makes it up as it goes along.  Complying with that can be extremely difficult.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen this in the public service.  We have built community hospitals to the highest of standards and there has been a delay in opening them.  HIQA has refused to allow them to open, even though they have been built to its standards.  The authority comes along, moves the goalposts and says that it wants the hospital management to do things differently, in a new building which would have been compliant months or a year or two beforehand.  HIQA says that it is not compliant now.  We actually have to change new hospitals and new buildings to comply with new HIQA regulations.<\/p>  <p>  Coming back to the private nursing homes and the difficulties they have in running their business, I wish to acknowledge the excellent service they give and the excellent role that they play in our communities.  This includes the employment they create and the care they give to elderly, vulnerable and sick people, keeping them as near as they can to being at home.  Of course, I rightly acknowledge our carers and I hope to ensure that we help these people in every and any way we can in the every important work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100050#CCC00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1531329300,"counter":505,"content":"<p>First, I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  I also thank them for their positive ideas and constructive comments.  This is an important Bill and it is a step in the right direction.  Equally, I acknowledge that we have a lot to do for carers, and I intend to do a lot more for carers.  I wish to address some of the points raised by Deputies.  Deputy Stephen Donnelly talked about extending the scheme and I am open to that.  Extending home supports and issues like that are something we should look at in the future.  The figure of &euro;2.8 million or &euro;3 million was mentioned.  From my research, the figure that we would realistically be looking at is approximately &euro;6 million.  That is the ballpark figure.  We acknowledge the step we have taken, but we have to put in more supports.  I take that valid point.  That is something we should look at in the budgetary process, and it is something I will drive forward.<\/p><p>Deputy Michael Moynihan rased important issues regarding respite and carer's holiday cover.  That is an issue I have heard about as well.  I am determined to work with the Department of Health and the HSE on this issue.<\/p><p>Deputy John Brassil raised the issue of GP contracts, which is an important part of this debate.  We have to move on in those negotiations.  The Deputy also raised the issue of home care packages, particularly focusing on community healthcare organisation, CHO 7, where there seems to be a problem with palliative care.  Again, I will work with my colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE, as well as the Minister for Health on that particular area.  I will also address gaps in any other areas as well.  <\/p><p>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was supportive of the Bill.  He rightly said that it was a step but that we need to make more progress.  I take that criticism, and I welcome his support for carers in society at large.  I also take his point on the amendment.  I know it was ruled out of order, but that is a live debate and something we have to drive for the future.  I strongly believe in what the Deputy said about the principle of full transition to a national health service.  We either believe in Sl&aacute;intecare or we do not, and that is something I will push for within government.<\/p><p>A point was raised on those acting <i>in loco parentis. <\/i>Since our meeting at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality I have put that question to my Department.  I have my own views on that.  We have to review it but I will come back to the Deputy with a more detailed answer, because the last response he received was in April or May.  I put it the issue to my Department them after the committee meeting.  Like the Deputy, many parents and family members have come to me about problems arising from the <i>in loco parentis <\/i>debate.  <\/p><p>Deputy Willie Penrose was supportive of the Bill.  He is not here now.  He has been pushing for the interests of carers in this House for many years.<\/p><p>He has been a champion of carers.  I commend his work and I wish him well in retirement.  Of course, I accept the valid criticism that we need to do more, but I emphasise this is a step in the right direction for starters.  He also mentioned he will introduce a carer's need assessment Bill and I look forward to that in September.<\/p> <p> Deputy Paul Murphy supported the Bill but, like many speakers, he felt it should be broadened.  He also paid tribute to the home helps and pointed out housing issues with regard to residential centres.  I remind colleagues that I announced &euro;14 million last week for housing adaptation grants, a &euro;2 million increase on last year's figure.  Despite 83 press releases, it was not mentioned in any newspaper or media organisation.  Good news does not travel.<\/p> <p> Deputy Broughan mentioned the carer's half rate.  I can confirm the GP card will be there.  He also mentioned those aged over 70.  I welcome the support of Deputy Michael Collins.  As he said, we have to do more for carers and home help.  He strongly emphasised that when we are dealing with health services there should be accountability for the amount of money being spent.  I accept that and it is something I focus on every day as Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae spoke about home help, the physical issue of hoists and medical cards, and we need to develop on these.<\/p> <p> It is a pity Deputy Mattie McGrath is not in the Chamber because I want to remind him my job is to deal with disability and carers as Minister of State and I am here.  I try to push the agenda very strongly.<\/p> <p> Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall raised a number of important points and I welcome her comments.  I did state the Bill is a small measure and a step in the right direction.  I recognise the point she made on training.  I accept that we need training for carers.  On that issue, I was in Sligo recently where I met a group of young social care students who will come into the system next year.  That is the type of training we need more of.  We have a lot of people in the sector who are not trained and of course I take the point.  The issue of aids and appliances has come up and I mentioned the housing adaptation grants.  With regard to the habitual residency rule and social welfare supports, it is something we should absolutely look at and it is something I strongly believe in.  Deputy Shortall also mentioned the carer's half rate and I confirmed they will get the free GP card.  Deputy Shortall acknowledged the work being done by Family Carers Ireland.  I know many people in that association and we absolutely have to fund them.  She also dealt with the issue of GPs, which is a very important issue.<\/p> <p> To go back to the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others, Sl&aacute;intecare is a new model of care.  There is a new emphasis on more services in the community, but we also have to face the reality that we have to have that capacity at primary care level.  We have an issue there and I accept that point.<\/p> <p> I welcome the support of Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.  He spoke about the bureaucracy of the application forms and the fact that Deputies spend a lot of time on them.  It is something about which we need to remind people in the services.<\/p> <p> Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice spoke about the rural issue and farmers who are carers.  It is an important aspect of the debate.  Another part of debate about which I feel very strongly, and on which he made a valid point, is those who give up their jobs to care.  We have to be mindful of the people who give up work.  There should be a long-term plan and we will work on it.  Today is only part of the plan.  I do not want to get carried away here.  I accept the points on it but we need to look at a long-term care plan.  Deputy Fitzmaurice validly made the point about giving somebody a couple of hundred euro a week to stay at home and look after a person with a disability or a senior citizen rather than that person going into a nursing home or residential centre.  He spoke about &euro;1,000 but I believe the cost of some is &euro;1,200, &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500.<\/p> <p> The final point was raised by Deputy Michael Healy Rae who strongly supports the carers, which I acknowledge.  I know from meeting the Deputy in Kerry he is very involved in disability issues.  He rightly raised the GP issue.  We have to have the GPs with us on these issues and we have to be conscious of this.  The Deputy also mentioned the issue of nursing homes and regulation.  These are issues on which I have regular discussions with the officials in the Department of Health.  The Bill is a step for the 14,000 carers.  It states we appreciate the work being done and this is why we are granting the free GP service.<\/p> <p> Other things are also happening, which are often not recognised.  The carer's grant was restored to &euro;1,700 per family and 101,000 families got it.  The other issue was the medical card extension for children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  An extra 11,000 children received that medical card over the past year.  Three weeks ago at the Central Remedial Clinic I announced &euro;16 million for ability programs for 2,600 young people with physical and intellectual disabilities.  As I mentioned, we also had the &euro;10 million in 2018 for the respite care homes.  Many of these houses are now being opened.  Another issue people should keep an eye on, because many people are not aware of it, is the annual home care credit increased by &euro;100 to &euro;1,200.<\/p> <p> There are supports.  Do we need to do more?  Absolutely.  Am I listening to the suggestion put forward by colleagues?  Absolutely, but I ask everybody one favour.  When it comes to the crunch over the next few weeks in the debate on the Estimates, and we have already had our first meeting, I will put residential services, carers and people with disabilities at the top of my list with regard to public spending.  Other people will argue that we need more tax cuts and will argue for other issues.  I need the support of all Members of the House, regardless of party or being an Independent.  If everybody rallies around the carers we can get more in the budget for them because I totally value the magnificent work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100050#CCC00300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531329900,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531329900,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I am required to put the following question in accordance with an order of the D&aacute;il of 10 July, that in respect of sections 1 to 5, inclusive, each section is hereby agreed to in committee, the Title is hereby agreed to in committee and the Bill is accordingly reported to the House without amendment.

Its purpose is to correct a typographical and technical error in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the latter.  The Children and Family Relationships Act represents one of the most significant changes in family law in a generation and attempts to better reflect the reality of contemporary family life in this country.  It was enacted to reform family law in a way that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, the reality of contemporary family life in Ireland and to meet the needs of children living in diverse family types.<\/p>  <p>  Children are no longer raised solely in the traditional mother-father nuclear family but in a myriad of forms.  For example, these relationships may be as a biological or social parent, as a guardian or as an adoptive parent.  Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, for which I am responsible, recognise the new biological reality of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, where children may be born to people using donor gametes and embryos.  The provisions encompassing DAHR procedures relate to cases where the intending mother carries the pregnancy and gives birth to the child.  As a result, these provisions apply to heterosexual couples, female same-sex couples and a single woman undergoing a DAHR procedure.  As such, Parts 2 and 3 represent key elements of the Children and Family Relationships Act and their commencement is required to clarify the legal position of all parties involved in a DAHR procedure, but particularly the children born from such procedures.  Being able to proceed with the commencement, once this short piece of legislation passes, will have a very positive impact on the rights of families which have sought donor assistance to conceive.  It is my intention, once this Bill has been enacted, to commence Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act in the autumn.  I have met stakeholders in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual, LGBT, groups to convey this to them.<\/p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was originally brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, who described it at the time as \"a watershed in the development of family law&rdquo;.  The advent of DAHR arrangements has led to the birth of children who need legal certainty in their parentage and guardians.  We have a responsibility to put in place a legislative framework that can provide that certainty.  In addition to clarifying the legal parentage for donor-conceived children, the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 will also help to vindicate the rights of such donor-conceived children to information on their genetic heritage through the establishment of the national donor-conceived person register and the prohibition of anonymous gamete and embryo donation.<\/p>  <p>  The national donor-conceived person register will house the details of the relevant donor, the intending parents and the child or children born as a result of a given DAHR procedure in Ireland.  The introduction of this register acknowledges that many donor-conceived children will be curious as to their genetic origins and provides an important and safe mechanism through which they can access the information relating to the relevant donor, such as his or her name, date of birth and contact details, should they so wish.  Similarly, donor-conceived children will also be able to seek and obtain information relating to other children born as a result of other DAHR procedures involving the same donor.<\/p>  <p>  Another important aspect of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, and one that has been the subject of some confusion in recent weeks, is the provisions regarding retrospective declarations of parentage.  These provisions enable parents of donor-conceived children, who have been born prior to the commencement of Part 2 of the original Act, to seek a declaration of parentage through the courts.  The commencement of these retrospective provisions has been the subject of extensive interest and discussion, both in media discourse and at a political and parliamentary level.  I am very aware that the implementation of these provisions is particularly eagerly anticipated by the LGBT community.  However, the Children and Family Relationships Act is not a panacea and does not regulate all aspects of assisted human reproduction.  Much of the focus has related to matters that the Children and Family Relationships Act does not actually encompass.  This Act specifically relates to DAHR procedures where the intending mother is also the birth mother.  It is a really important point and I have had conversations with many Deputies and Senators, as well as members of the LGBT community, about this.  There is much more we need to do in this area but it is not my intention to reopen the debate on the Act.  We are fixing the error and seeking to commence the Act in full, providing the legal certainty that was intended by the Oireachtas.  A very important discussion must take place at the health committee in the first instance on the assisted human reproduction Bill, and we can make very significant inroads into a number of these important matters.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important to emphasise that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 does not encompass surrogacy.  Provisions relating to the regulation of surrogacy in Ireland are included in the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017, to which I have referred.  The latter Bill, which officials in my Department are currently drafting in conjunction with the Attorney General, will provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction, of which DAHR procedures is just a small part.<\/p><p>The general scheme is published on my Department website.  The Joint Committee on Health review of the general scheme as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process is still ongoing.<\/p> <p> In my discussions with LGBT+ groups in recent days and weeks there has been an eagerness to contribute to the process of pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme.  I hope that the joint committee can facilitate as much work as quickly as possible in that regard.  We would certainly welcome the input of those groups in the report of the committee on the pre-legislative scrutiny as we continue the development of the Bill.<\/p> <p> It is important to emphasise that this amending Bill does not change any of the substantive provisions or policy intention of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act.  We are fixing typographical errors to give effect to the provisions and policy intention debated and passed by these Houses.  As I stated from the outset, the sole purpose of this Bill is to remedy a number of technical drafting issues with the original Act.  This will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.<\/p> <p> I will go through the Bill to outline the content of each section.  Section 1 provides that the definition of the principal Act to be amended is the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.<\/p> <p> Section 2 amends section 4(a)(ii) of the principal Act relating to the definition of \"donor\" by the substitution of \"section 26(5)\" for \"section 26(6)\".  Section 26(5) of the Act of 2015 refers to gametes that are subject to a transition period of three years, during which those acquired on an anonymous basis prior to the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act may be used in a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure in the State subject to certain conditions.  In the Act of 2015 as enacted, section 4(a)(ii) relating to the definition of \"donor\" refers to section 26(6) rather than section 26(5).  This amendment simply resolves the matter.<\/p> <p> Section 3 amends section 14 of the principal Act to provide for the Minister for Health to make regulations under that section.<\/p> <p> Section 4 amends section 16 of the principal Act to provide for the Minister for Health to make regulations under that section.<\/p> <p> Section 5 sets out the citation and commencement provisions for the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018.<\/p> <p> The technology of assisted human reproduction has created a new reality.  Irish law must adapt to reflect these changes.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 brought much needed clarity in this area.  Further delays to commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act will impact the rights of the most vulnerable individuals in a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure - the children.  That is why we are all so eager to rectify this area.  It will enable us to commence these provisions in the autumn and have declarations of parentage established.  That will allow the families affected to be recognised as we all intended when we voted for issues like marriage equality and passed legislation to give effect to the new reality of a more inclusive and tolerant Ireland.<\/p> <p> There is far more work to be done on other important issues, including issues relating to surrogacy.  I hope the Oireachtas seriously gets on with that business.  Certainly, I will be committed in that regard in the autumn session and beyond with this assisted human reproduction legislation.  Again, I refer people to the general scheme on my Department's website and the pre-legislative scrutiny currently under way in the Joint Committee on Health.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.  I hope we can speedily resolve the technical issues that the Bill seeks to address and facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3.  I have no doubt we all agree these provisions are eagerly awaited and long overdue.  I thank Members of all parties and groupings for their co-operation in the speedy introduction of this stand-alone Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100052#EEE00500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531331100,"counter":540,"content":"<p>The 2015 Act was one of the most important reforms in child and family law since the Adoption Act in 2010.  Critically, it made the best interests of the child the central consideration in Irish family law where decisions regarding the child were being made.  It addressed issues of guardianship, custody, access, maintenance, adoption, parentage and some elements of assisted human reproduction.  It was an important step forward in recognising the evolving nature of families in Ireland.  It received cross-party support and I hope that support will continue this evening.  The Minister should note that Fianna F&aacute;il will support this technical amending Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The briefing we have received is that everything before the House is purely technical.  That is set out in the explanatory memorandum.  We are told the Bill does not change any of the substance of the Act.  Therefore, I do not intend opening up the Act again this evening.  It was debated at length and went through with cross-party support.  However, that position is clearly on an understanding that this legislation is as we have been told, that is to say, purely technical and purely to correct a typographical error.

It will ensure clear understanding about the rights, responsibilities and consent in donor-assisted reproduction.  It will ensure a child's right to know his or her genetic identity, as enshrined by the United Nations.<\/p>  <p>  Commencement of these provisions will be particularly welcome for same-sex couples.  It will provide clarity on important issues of guardianship, custody, access, maintenance, adoption and parentage.

It will allow parents to have their names on the birth certificates of their children, which is highly significant on a legal level as well as on an emotional and human level.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill does not deal with many of the outstanding errors relating to assisted human reproduction.

I welcome the families, some of whom are in the Gallery and more of whom will be watching the proceedings this evening.  It is a great evening for them and there is much to be celebrated.<\/p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was signed into law three years ago.  That was definitely a monumental year for the LGBTQ community in this State.  The passing of the marriage equality referendum and the Act represented great change for this State.  The significance of that year pointed definitively to a brighter and more inclusive future for those in the LGBTI community.  Most important, it produced some tangible results for them.<\/p>  <p>  There were definitive results and there was a sense of achievement.  However, in the case of the Children and Family Relationships Act the achievement only appeared to be real.  Unfortunately, the reality of that Act has yet to be fulfilled and much of what was promised has not been delivered for those in the LGBTI community and same-sex couples.  It is incredibly unfortunate that this is the case and that we have to ask why it has taken three years to bring forward even the most limited legislation to implement the relevant parts of that Act on behalf of those affected.  Since I was elected to the House I have called for legislation to fully implement the Act time and again.  Many other Deputies have done likewise.<\/p>  <p>  There are same-sex families and couples who will definitely benefit from this legislation.  Today is no doubt a significant day for them.  With this in mind I commend the Minister and the Department on bringing forward this legislation.  I hope this legislation delivers for them and gives them and their children the provisions and protections they need.<\/p>  <p>  While the families affected are families in our eyes and in their eyes, this legislation ensures that the State recognises them as families and gives them the opportunity to register the births of the children with both parents registered on all relevant documentation.  The real-life legal protections that this offers and the associated implications cannot be understated for these families.  Moreover, we cannot downplay the positive personal effect of the State recognising both parents on a child's documents.<\/p>  <p>  I have some experience of this, dating from when I tried to get a passport for my daughter, who was born before my husband and I were married.<\/p><p>It was many years ago and much has changed in this State since then.  I found it incredibly difficult to find a garda who would stamp the form because my husband and I were not then married.  I knew who my child's father was but it was difficult.  It felt disrespectful to my family that we did not fit in and were treated like a square peg in a round hole.  That is well over 20 years ago and I am happy that circumstances have changed.  However, I have received extensive correspondence from same-sex couples.  All they seek is what I sought then, namely recognition for our little family unit, however it is constituted.  I can understand their concerns and the fact that what is on that piece of paper is important.  Although people tell them that they know they are a family, having that piece of paper is important.  <\/p> <p> The LGBTI community have fought hard for this legislation.  They should not have had to fight for it; it should have been forthcoming from the State.  At the recent Pride parade, I saw an interesting banner that said, \"You only gave us rights because we gave you riots\".  There is some truth in that.  People have had to fight hard for basic recognition.  That was wrong but it is good that we have begun the process of putting that right.<\/p> <p> Members of the LGBTI community continue to fight for their rights.  With that in mind, I cannot let the opportunity pass without commenting on some of the disappointing aspects of this Bill and what it fails to do.  The State has a long history of failing the LGBTI community and even with the progressive and positive moves in recent times, that cannot be forgotten.  It is concerning that the State is leaving a number of same-sex couples behind and that this legislation will not cover them.  Male same-sex couples will be left behind and will not be covered by this legislation as will some female same-sex couples who did not choose home insemination or others who chose fertility treatments abroad and for those who chose to go the route of surrogacy, particularly in the case of male same-sex relationships.<\/p> <p> I cannot overstate the concern and disappointment of the many families who have contacted me because they believe this legislation will not help their situation.  These families are tired of having to constantly fight for their rights and they want a normal life.  Like any family, they want to register the births of their children with both parents on the documentation.  <\/p> <p> The Minister and the Government will bring forward two different Bills to address the outstanding issues relating to the Child and Family Relationships Act.  They need to speak to the stakeholders, listen to their concerns and they must be guided by what they tell them.  Some of the sections of the Child and Family Relationships Act that have not been implemented need the implementation of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017 to become law.  I urge that this Bill come back before the health committee for another round of pre-legislative scrutiny as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> I am happy that this legislation covers some same-sex couples but we have a job to do to ensure that the message of inclusivity that we are trying to send out is made a reality for the families who so desperately need it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100053#FFF00400","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531331700,"counter":543,"content":"<p>While I welcome this Bill, it is ridiculous that three years after marriage equality was endorsed by the people in a referendum, many families are not seen as equal in the eyes of the State.  Over the past year, I have repeatedly raised this issue in the House under Questions on Promised Legislation and through written parliamentary questions.  Time and again, we were given deadlines that were not met and we were brushed off.  Many same-sex families have rightly grown very angry at the Government's failure to sort this out.  Therefore it is good to finally have something concrete before us.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will benefit many LGBTI couples by giving them the opportunity to register both parents on a birth certificate and to avail of equal parental rights, as enjoyed by other families.  This ensures legal protection on issues such as guardianship and inheritance rights.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that this Bill does not go far enough.  Male same-sex couples will be largely left behind along with many female same-sex couples, including those who conceived through home insemination.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, many families who are very upset have contacted me.

Important meetings took place.  &quot;We are Family&quot; was the theme of this year's Pride parade and political pressure was bearing down on the Government whereby they could not stand over the situation any longer.  It is a movement of people forcing the Government to act on the issue.<\/p><p>I also want to point out the inadequacies of this Bill.  I acknowledge that they are rooted in the legislation that was passed three years ago, rather than being inadequacies of this particular Bill, but the number of LGBTQ+ parents who are excluded is an issue.  Many of them will gather outside the D&aacute;il at lunchtime tomorrow to protest, and I will join them.  They support the passing of the Bill but they demand action to ensure that all parents will be treated equally.  <\/p><p>Some of the practical issues have been referred to.  I have been in touch with a couple recently, Leeane and Nile.  Leeane wrote:<\/p><blockquote>We they had created their baby together, and went through the process every couple does with the intention of creating a human.  I willing signed up to love and care for someone for the rest of my life.  Is this not what makes a family?<br \/><br \/>This month, we celebrate gay pride.  The theme is &quot;We are Family&quot;.  How much of a slap in the face is this to all same-sex parents out there.  Instead of celebrating our first Pride as a family we will be marching and protesting for our rights again.<\/blockquote><p>I wish I could tell Leeane that after the passing of this legislation, her family will be fully recognised, but unfortunately they will not because they had a home insemination.  This is not a situation of a known donor; the donor is traceable and attended a clinic outside the jurisdiction, so unfortunately they will not be covered by this legislation.  <\/p><p>The point has been made that those who availed of surrogacy, which in the vast majority of cases is men, are not covered.<\/p><p>They are left in the same legal limbo for the moment, until the other legislation is brought forward.  The other key issues relate to clinics outside the State, which are not being covered in some circumstances, and to retrospective recognition of the myriad circumstances in which same-sex parents find themselves because of the difficult legal situation they have been in.  Provision needs to be made for proper backdating of recognition so that birth certificates can be recorded correctly.  This has implications for children.  I see this primarily as an issue of children's rights.  If a parent dies, for example, serious legal issues and complications can arise in respect of guardianship, inheritance and so on.  This is a matter of discrimination.  For that reason, we will press our amendment when the Bill is debated in detail on Committee and Report Stages.  We are seeking to commit the Government to come back and report on this matter six months after the commencement of this Act.  We want to make sure the Government cannot avoid dealing with these issues.  We believe it should be forced to come back and set out what it intends to do with regard to issues like surrogacy, insemination outside the State, including home insemination, and the retrospective issuing of birth certificates.  It is appropriate for the D&aacute;il to make such a demand of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100054#GGG00400","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531332300,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I concur with everything that has been said.  I will seek to add to it.  In a year in which the family is being celebrated by both Pride and the Pope, it is ironic that we are just catching up and putting proper structures on the families of same-sex couples.  I know the Minister recognises that there is a problem.  I spoke to him a short time ago.  He is not accepting our amendment, which we will press.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will explain why the Minister is not accepting it.  Many same-sex couples are concerned that our amendment will have an impact on the Bill.  I assure them that if the amendment is accepted, the only impact it will have will be a positive one.  If it is rejected, it will have no impact whatsoever on the Bill.  There should be no worries about that.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy Paul Murphy, I want to mention the case of a couple that falls into this category.  Stephanie and Bex have a daughter, Eva.  They live in Roscommon.  Stephanie, who is the birth mother, suffers from an arthritic condition which is worsened by treatment with hormones.  Her doctor recommended that she should not go to the clinic.  He said she should stay at home to have home insemination carried out.  Stephanie and Bex know the donor.  Under the legal contract they have drawn up with the donor, he waives all commitments and any obligation to the child.  They do not hold him responsible for maintenance or anything of that nature.  When Eva reaches the age of 18, she will be free to seek him out and he will be happy to meet her at that point.  That is all set out in a legal agreement that has been drafted by both sides.  Stephanie and Bex are left in a difficult situation.  I can only feel for them.  When the health of a woman who has a small child is compromised to the extent that she is receiving treatment, there has to be a worry that her demise might leave the other parent and the child in limbo.  As previous speakers have said, in circumstances in which a birth mother is ill there is a possibility that her health will become more compromised.  We hope that women in these circumstances do well and these issues do not come into play.  The woman in this case needs to do well with her mental health and with her lifestyle.  If that is to happen, she needs the same protections that this legislation attempts to give to all other same-sex couples.<\/p>  <p>  Another cohort of couples will stay at home for insemination because of the cost of going to these clinics.  They cannot afford the &euro;1,500 that is needed to make each effort.  Their economic circumstances prohibit them from being recognised by the State as a family.  Gay couples who have opted for home insemination and gay couples who have gone through surrogacy are not recognised.  For all of these reasons, we believe our amendment would strengthen the hand of the Minister and the committee, rather than weakening it.  That is why we propose that a report be prepared within six months of the Bill being passed.<\/p>  <p>  We do not want to leave anyone behind.  In this Chamber, we talk a lot about equality.  The Taoiseach talks a lot about being the leader of an Ireland of equal opportunities.  This legislation denies such equality to a cohort of parents and their children.  I plead with the Minister of State to accept our amendment.  If he does not do so, I plead with Deputies on all sides of the House to vote for it.  The amendment will not harm the overall Bill.  All it will do is strengthen the future work of the committee as it seeks to deal with surrogacy, legacy issues and retrospective parenting.  I have mentioned the sad and compelling case of Stephanie and Bex.  There are others who cannot afford treatment in the clinics.  I ask Deputies to support this amendment.  It will not damage the overall Bill we have before us tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100055#HHH00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1531332300,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputy Pringle.  There is a great deal of confusion about this issue because people think it involves moving the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 onto the next stage.  Like every Deputy who has spoken so far in this debate, I have received many emails on this Bill.  In light of the ongoing confusion I have mentioned, a concerted effort is needed to send people a message about what is involved in this amending Bill, which is necessary to facilitate the enactment of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act.  My understanding is that this technical Bill involves the amendment of two sections of the 2015 Act.  Section 4 gives certain rights to families that have children from anonymous gametes and intend to use existing stored anonymous gametes to have further children who will be siblings to the existing children.  This acts as a transitional arrangement to enable those who have conceived via anonymous donors to use gametes stored from the same donation for the conception of another child.  However, anonymous donation will be banned after the 2015 Act has been fully commenced.  This amending Bill will specifically amend a reference to \"section 26(6)\" in section 4 of the 2015 Act.  Without the correct reference, families will not be able to use their stored donor gametes at all, which would go against the transitional arrangement inherent in section 4 of the 2015 Act.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for us to send a message to people about what is involved in this legislation.  Sections 14 and 16 of the 2015 Act deal with consent forms and cover numerous circumstances in relation to donation, including consent to use donation and to have donor implantation.  They also give the Minister the power to make regulations in this regard.  This amending legislation will amend sections 14 and 16 to enable the enactment of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act.  I want to clarify that this amending Bill addresses the position in respect of same-sex female couples only.  My understanding is that the position in respect of same-sex male couples will be addressed in the upcoming assisted human reproduction Bill at the end of the year.  That is one of the reasons I support the amendment that is being proposed by People Before Profit.  It is important for us to have a timeline.  After this amending Bill has amended the relevant sections of the 2015 Act in the manner I have outlined, it will be possible for Parts 2 and 3 of that Act to be enacted.  The enactment of those Parts will allow same-sex female couples to apply to the courts to declare parentage.  It will not allow for the deregistration and reregistration of a birth certificate that is required to have a partner's name on the birth certificate.  For this to happen, Part 9 will have to be enacted and this falls under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection<\/p>  <p>  Other Deputies have mentioned particular queries they have received.  I would like to refer to a query I have received from a couple.  The person who sent me the query said that she and her wife have a two year old daughter and that she is pregnant with their second child.  They went abroad - to Spain and to Portugal - for both babies to avail of reciprocal IVF, which is not legal in Ireland.  This form of shared motherhood means that the woman who wrote to me carries the pregnancies and her wife's eggs are used.  Even though her wife is the biological mother of both children, she is a legal stranger to them currently.  This woman told me she understands that the Bill before the House will cover only those lesbian couples that have used Irish clinics with identifiable donors.  She and her partner used a clinic abroad with an anonymous donor because this was the only option open to them in Spain and Portugal.  They want to know where this legislation will leave them.  The woman who contacted me thinks it is crazy to think this legislation will not extend to her wife, who is the biological mother of their children.  She made the point that if anything, her wife and not her should be the person who has rights to the children.  Regardless of how same-sex couples conceive their children - in clinics, through IVF, via home insemination or through surrogacy - their children are all equal.<\/p><p>People want equality and legal recognition.<br\/><br\/>As I stated, it is an amending Bill.  Most parties will be supporting it because it is three years too late.  It should have been introduced much earlier.  I will be supporting the amendment tabled by People Before Profit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100055#HHH00500","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531332900,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I raised these issues during Leaders' Questions last week because of a mass of confusion and anxiety among families in limbo due to the slow implementation of relevant legislation and a lack of communication from the Department of Health.  While it is important to understand what this amending Bill and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 will look like when fully commenced, it is also important to understand what the legislation will not cover.  I hope to clarify this is my time today.<\/p>  <p>  Some Parts of the Act of 2015 have been commenced since its enactment in 2015 but it remains a mystery as to why it has taken so long to commence Parts 2 and 3.  All the Government has said is that it is largely due to errors in drafting.  This is fair enough but I agree with Deputy Paul Murphy that an amendment setting a timeframe, whereby one would have to report back, would have dealt with the issue.  We could, therefore, have commenced the legislation a long time ago.  Therefore, I will support the amendment also.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to correct the errors.  I hope the Bill will be passed by the end of this week in order that the various Parts can be commenced.  This will mean Part 9, which establishes the donor-conceived persons register, can be commenced by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in or about October 2018.<\/p>  <p>  As of July 2018, the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Child and Family Relationships Act 2015 will allow some LGBTQI parents to be legally recognised as co-parents of the children.  The primary focus of Parts 2 and 3 is conceptions using donor sperm in a clinic in Ireland.  This is most likely to affect lesbian couples or same-sex couples where both partners are legally recognisable as female where one partner carries a pregnancy.  However, the amending legislation will not cover adoption, surrogacy, home inseminations or reciprocal IVF using donor sperm.  A separation of guardianship and parentage rights will remain until these aspects are addressed in the assisted human reproduction Bill.  This is where issues regarding the various other forms of conception or the forms affected by not commencing legislation must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to pathways to parenthood not currently included in this Bill, the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017 may afford a significant opportunity for inclusion.  Commencement of Parts 2 and 3, along with Part 9, which is to be commenced at a later date, will allow for certain same-sex parents to register with the registrars for births, deaths and marriages as parents and obtain a birth certificate that reflects this, in the following circumstances.  The first is retrospective recognition of children conceived before commencement using an anonymous sperm donor in a clinic in Ireland or abroad, and conception using a traceable sperm donor in a clinic in Ireland or abroad, implying the child has a right to trace the donor when he or she reaches 18 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to clarify the date of conception is the relevant point in time so a pregnancy ongoing at the time of commencement will not be affected and any children born as a result of that pregnancy will be covered by the retrospective provisions.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that section 26(5) allows clinics to use donor sperm acquired before the date of commencement in a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure for a period of three years from the date of commencement regardless of the anonymous status of the donor.  This is only where the intending parent is already the parent of a child born as a result of a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure using sperm from the same donor but clearly allows families that wish to have genetic siblings to achieve that objective.  A similar position arises with respect to embryos created prior to commencement regardless of the anonymous status of the donor or donors.  There is, however, a significant argument that the three-year time limit will not apply to embryos. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of future recognition for children conceived after the commencement date, it can be achieved using a traceable sperm donor in a clinic in Ireland only, or using a known donor in a clinic in Ireland only.  Although it is not known how this process would work in practice, in theory the legislation does appear to allow for this scenario.  Any further clarification from the Minister on this point would be much appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  One uncertainty remains in this Bill.  The issue of children conceived after commencement in a clinic abroad or in a clinic using an anonymous donor will not be covered by the legislation.  It is not clear why the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 does not recognise clinics abroad, particularly when many of them could be in a position to satisfy the document requirements of the Act.  This should be addressed in all future legislative developments.  I hope the Minister will take this issue into account given the reality that couples are using clinics abroad that address their medical needs and which should be reflected here.<\/p>  <p>  I thank LGBT Ireland, which has done a considerable amount of work on seeking clarification and information on legislation that has a drastic impact on families in Ireland.  I hope to see the assisted human reproduction Bill in the D&aacute;il in the next term in order that outstanding issues will be addressed properly in consultation with civil society and parents who have been affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1531332900,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p><p>I have no difficulty with the Bill.  It is a technical Bill to address problems with the 2015 Act.  I will certainly be supporting it on that basis.  As other Members have said, however, one must ask why, three full years after the passage of the 2015 legislation, it has not been enacted in full.  When one considers what has happened in respect of adoption, and now in respect of registration, one must ask why so many mistakes were made.  There were mistakes in addition to a delay.  How were the mistakes made?  Why has it taken three years and a lot of pressure by LGBT Ireland to force this issue?<\/p><p>There are three Departments involved, namely, the Departments of Health, Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Justice and Equality.  It seems there was no sense of urgency on the part of any of those Departments with a view to making progress on this issue and ensuring the implementation of the 2015 Act.<\/p><p>I do not have any difficulty with the technical amendments.  They deal with a transitional arrangement for those already conceived via an anonymous donor and for gametes from the same donor that are already stored in the event that there is a desire to conceive another child - a related child.  We know anonymous donation will be banned once the principal Act is fully commenced.  That is fine.  The other aspect is to deal with consent forms in regard to the numerous circumstances associated with donation.  I refer to consent to use donation, consent to have donor implementation and so on.  The two amendments are technical amendments to make improvements in this regard to allow the commencement of Parts 2 and 3.  <\/p><p>Over recent weeks, when asking about this, as other Members have done, I concluded it is quite incredible that, as recently as 12 June, the response from the Department of Health was that there were discussions ongoing and that &quot;we do not wish to pre-empt the outcome by citing specific details.&quot;  It also stated, &quot;Clarification on whether primary legislation is required to resolve these issues is being sought.&quot;  It is incredible that, up to last month, clarification had not been sought and that the question of whether primary legislation was needed was still being considered.  Of course, we do need it and that is why were here tonight.  Why were three years allowed to elapse before that was actually established?<\/p><p>An issue also arises regarding Part 9.  When I raised this with the Minister for Justice and Equality recently, the reply was really passing the buck.  It stated Part 9 could not be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 were dealt with.  With regard to Part 9 and registration, it was stated it was a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  There is extraordinary passing of the buck by various Departments.  When I raised the matter with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the response was quite extraordinary.  The Minister for Justice and Equality said it is a matter for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection while the latter stated: <\/p><blockquote>A number of amendments to civil registration legislation, including [Parts 2 and 3], remain to be commenced pending the roll-out of training to staff of the Civil Registration Service who are employees of the HSE.  The General Register Office is in a position to begin provision of training as soon as the HSE notifies it of the dates and venues.<\/blockquote><p>For goodness sake, people's lives are depending on this.  Families are crying out for proper registration systems but there seems to be messing going on within the HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection about the dates and venues for the training of staff.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, recently stated to me that \"Discussions to commence the training are well advanced and it should hopefully commence shortly.\"<\/p> <p> Will the Minister take hold of this issue and ensure that as soon as this Bill is passed, it can be completed so we can get to a point where staff in the HSE are provided with proper training for the new registration system?  What has been going on over recent times is just nonsense.  What were the three Departments doing?  Finally, the amendment from Deputy Paul Murphy and his colleagues is absolutely sensible.  I do not see why all of us would not agree to it.  I hope the Minister will support it.  Certainly, the Social Democrats are happy to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100056#JJJ00300","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531333500,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I am glad to take part in the debate tonight.  My party was not in the D&aacute;il when the Children and Family Relationships Act was passed so it has been interesting to hear about the different cases involving different families, circumstances, realities, legal gaps and the different failings that exist at present.  I echo the regret of those who may have been involved in the passing of the original legislation that the commencement of these sections has been delayed for three years because of a technical failing.  We support the Government's Bill to address that and to ensure the full commencement of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that we are living in an Ireland which, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, recognises every type of family and recognises the importance of protecting their rights.  I also welcome the Minister's clarification that the legislation is framed with a core understanding or commitment in it that the rights of the child as recognised by the United Nations are also included and guaranteed in the Bill's provisions, particularly with regard to the right at the age of 18 years to be able to find the identity of the original genetic parents.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has been engaged on the issue of birth certificates and birth certificate issues have been centre stage in the D&aacute;il in recent months.  I believe there is a right to that information and we should ensure it is provided for in the legislation.  There is a range of reasons that access to such information makes sense.  There will be difficulties with that for certain families and certain circumstances where it may restrict certain choices, but the approach that centres on the rights of the child, as well as the parents is the proper and correct way to go.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the clarification the Minister has outlined.

The norm was a female mother, male father and X number of children but that is no longer the case and it is positive that this Bill acknowledges it.  However, I agree with Deputy Joan Collins about the confusion that existed.<\/p><p>It is when we come into contact with people in different, non-traditional family groups that we become aware of the serious difficulties they face when registering their children and their status as parents.  Passports is another area.  For example, I know two women who married a couple of years ago and had a child this year.  Their dilemma was that the Children and Family Relationships Act had not been fully commenced so one of the couple would be a legal stranger to that child.  They had been overjoyed about marriage equality and that their relationship was legally recognised as equal and valid.  Then they had the joy of their child but that is somewhat on hold now.  They want to register their child and both parents of the child but without the legislation being commenced, the child would be registered as the child of a single parent, which is not the case.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work that is being done to address the issues, including the briefing given by the Department of Health and the Minister's engagement with the LGBTQ community.  At least with the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 same-sex female couples can apply to the courts to declare parentage but it will not allow for the de-registering and re-registering of a birth certificate to have the parents' names on the birth certificate.  Part 9 has to be commenced for that to happen, and that is under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Same-sex male couples will have to wait for the assisted human reproduction Bill.  There are LGBT couples who have or will have children and those parents and children should have the same rights as the biological children of heterosexual couples.  A heterosexual couple can use a sperm donor and nobody need know.  There are good examples from Canada, as I know personally from friends, of supports for same-sex couples to have children, such as assisted reproduction, surrogacy and sperm donors, and the process of registering the children is straightforward.<\/p><p>Last Saturday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>included personal accounts of parents in these situations.  A same-sex male married couple had a son through surrogacy in Canada, where they had been living.  On the child's Canadian birth certificate both men are listed as his parents but under current Irish family law neither has legal rights over their son.  The surrogate mother and her husband would be considered the child's legal parents even though she has no biological connection to the child as a donor egg was used.  Of course, it would be a costly process here to go through the courts.  There are also some good examples from UK law where the names of the same-sex parents are on the birth certificates.  In addition, there was an account of the difficulty of recognising adoptions arising from surrogacy.<\/p><p>It is positive that prior to the same-sex marriage referendum, the Children and Family Relationships Bill was passed to amend Irish family law and extend parental rights to non-traditional families.  Marriage equality was a positive start so there is now a need to address the other issues around parentage in the best interests of the children involved.  As the Minister said earlier, this is about accepting the reality.

I remember being in the House 15 years ago for the apology to people who had been in institutions and so forth.  At the time there was a list of certain institutions and over the years, other institutions have been added to it.  However, we left out many people and in doing that we compounded the hurt and hurt many more.  Last weekend I was in Mount Jerome.  Four new Bethany homes have been found and there is a new memorial there.  What we are doing in this situation is leaving people behind and that is not the idea behind this process.<\/p>  <p>  People passed a referendum in the expectation that we, as legislators, would come up with legislation for those family units.  Ireland is far different now from ten or 16 years ago.  There are different family formations and as an inclusive Ireland, we must represent that.  That is our job.  We are appealing to the Minister to consider the proposal being brought forward.  It is quite reasonable.  We are asking that after passing the Bill, the Minister will review this.  I do not understand what the problem is with that.  It commits the Government to conducting a review that will examine the status of parental rights of same-sex couples in terms of surrogacy and of those who sought fertility treatment outside the State.  It is something we should be able to examine.  It is a reasonable request and it should be part of this process in which we are engaged.<\/p><p>This is about families and individuals.  We all know the difficulties people are experiencing trying to access birth certificates, passports and so on and the difficulties on the family unit when one parent gets sick.

Human error is understandable but we need to take steps to right that error as soon as possible.  This is about children's rights.  It is about these children being treated in the same way as any other child.  Real and practical problems arise for people, including the emotional issue of not being properly recognised on a birth certificate.  There are also serious legal issues for children whose parents are not properly recognised.  For example, upon the death of a non-recognised parent a child may have to pay inheritance tax because he or she will not be legally recognised as the child of that person.  Pension benefits that might accrue to the child when somebody dies is also an issue and citizenship can also be an issue if the parent who is recognised as the parent is not Irish.  There are problems with passports, which parents need to sign-off on.  Couples are trying to live their lives and they cannot wait around for the Government to update this law.

I assure all Deputies that a huge amount of work has been undertaken by a number of extraordinarily dedicated officials to try to ensure that we get this right.  Deputy Crowe put it best when he said that people voted wanting to live in an inclusive Ireland.  However, this is a fast evolving area and we need to ensure that legislation responds to recognise that there are many different compositions of families - which is a good thing - and we need to protect and support all of those families and children.<\/p>  <p>  What we are seeking to do tonight is not to reopen the debate on a Bill passed in this House in 2015 and signed into law by the President but rather to fix an error in that legislation.  We then need to do what we should do as legislators, which is get on with passing the assisted human reproduction bill 2017.  I do not want to be, and I have no intention of being, in any way partisan on this issue because, as Deputy Coppinger said, the people cannot wait for Government to get on with it.  It is up to all of us in this House to get on with it.  I brought the general scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 before the Joint Committee on Health.  It is still with that committee and I am sure members of the committee are working hard on it.  I published the Bill following approval by Government.  No doubt we can make it a better Bill.  I had a good meeting with LGBT Ireland this week in the Department.  Taking Deputy Shortall's point on board, I have committed to convening a round table of all the relevant Ministers and Departments in early September where we will thrash out not only the issues related to health, social protection or education but all of the issues across the State that we need to resolve so we can make sure we have the best possible assisted human reproduction Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Coppinger referenced the amendment.  I do not want to divide the House on this issue because Members in all parties and groupings have worked hard and facilitated this time in the Oireachtas and that is genuinely appreciated by the people in the Gallery and those watching at home.  I do not want to pass an amendment that I am sure is well intentioned but will not make a difference to anybody.  The amendment asks the Minister to do a report but we do not need another report; rather, we need to pass the assisted human reproduction Bill, which is with the joint committee.  We need the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill completed, the Bill brought onto the floor of this House and the Government to get working with the Attorney General's office to be ready for it.<\/p>  <p>  We have all the reports we need.  The Deputies are proposing that what is provided for in the amendment be written into primary legislation to be sent to the President of Ireland to be signed and put on our Statute Book.  The amendment provides under subsection (a) that a report be made on the parental rights of same-sex couples in cases of surrogacy.  Until the Oireachtas gets around to legislating, those rights do not exist.  If the Deputies want to do something about surrogacy there is no point in them asking me to do a report to tell them what they and all of us know.  If they want rights for parents related to surrogacy we need to pass the assisted human reproduction Bill which has nothing to do with the legislation before us.  We do need to do it, and I am happy to work with Deputies to do it.  There is no point in them asking me to produce a report that will only tell them what they know, which is that these rights do not exist until such time as the Oireachtas gets around to doing its job in respect of the assisted human reproduction Bill. <\/p>  <p>  Subsection (b) asks the Minister to produce a report on the position of spouses, cohabitants and civil partners of those availing of a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure outside of the State.  I do not have jurisdiction outside of this State and even when people come back into this State, I do not have the legal powers to assert the quality of what took place in another country, the structures, laws, ethics of another country and so on.  Again, I would be producing a report telling the Deputies that the Minister is powerless in regard to what happens outside of the State.  Subsection (c) asks that the Minister do a report on the retrospective issuing of birth certificates and other documents to record both same-sex parents.  This already happens, except in the case of surrogacy which brings me make to my original point about how we need to deal with it.  <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate what Deputies Coppinger, Paul Murphy and Barry are trying to do in keeping the pressure on.  I want to keep the pressure on too and so my response in that regard is, \"Right back at ye\".  This is a minority Government wanting to work with the Opposition to pass the assisted human reproduction Bill, which I have published and can be viewed on my Department's website.  I do not want to pretend to do something that will not help anybody and would result in my officials having to draft a report that would tell the Deputies what they know.  I say this not to be mean-spirited, difficult or partisan but because I genuinely do not believe the amendment would achieve anything.  I would rather agree with the Deputies practical measures such as timelines for the assisted human reproduction Bill and how we can work on a cross-party basis to agree the next steps.  The Deputies are more than welcome to attend the round-table discussions that I propose to hold with relevant stakeholders and LGBT Ireland in terms of these issues.  I would be happy to agree practical measures.  I just do not believe the amendment is a practical measure.  I recognise that it is well intentioned and I do not mean to be partisan in relation to it.  We can discuss it further on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is long overdue and badly needed to rectify an error in order that we can provide declarations of parentage and recognise families that exist in a real and practical sense in our country today but need to be recognised in our law.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100058#LLL00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531334100,"counter":560,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1531334100,"counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100058#LLL00700"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531334100,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531334700,"counter":563,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531334700,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote><b>1. <\/b>In page 3, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;5. <\/b>The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 23:<blockquote><blockquote><b>&ldquo;23A. <\/b>Within six months of the coming into operation of the <i>Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Act 2018<\/i>, the Minister and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection shall have conducted a review of the following areas:<br \/><br \/>(a) the parental rights of same-sex couples in cases of surrogacy;<br \/><br \/>(b) the position of spouses, cohabitants and civil partners of those availing of a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure outside of the State or otherwise outside the remit of this Act; and<br \/><br \/>(c) the retrospective issuing of birth certificates and other documents to record both same-sex parents;<br \/><br \/>and lay a report on the review before both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I know the amendment has been mentioned, but I wish to clarify it and respond to what the Minister said.  We are proposing inserting a section into the principal Act to make it absolutely bona fide nailed down that within six months there has to be action on this.  We are proposing a report because that is the mechanism by which we can table an amendment to ensure it is acted upon tonight.  I do not see any contradiction between what the Minister has promised and us agreeing to the amendment.<\/p><p>We have failed people already; we all have to take responsibility for not seeing the drafting error.  We are ensuring that while this cannot be dealt with by tomorrow, it will be dealt with as soon as the D&aacute;il returns.  If the Minister comes back with legislation to deal with all these issues, that is fine.  We will not need a report but we will have done all we can to give people assurance that the D&aacute;il is taking this seriously.  I urge people to support the amendment.  It does not create unnecessary work for the Minister if he comes back and deals with the issues.<\/p><p>We are proposing that within six months the Ministers for Health and Employment Affairs and Social Protection shall have conducted a review dealing with the issues that were left out of the principal Act.  The first issue is the parental rights of same-sex couples in cases of surrogacy, which are not dealt with in the principal Act.<\/p><p>The second issue is the position of spouses, cohabitants and civil partners of those availing of donor-assisted human reproduction outside of the State or otherwise outside the remit of the Act.  While, of course, that is outside the State, the children are inside the State.  It does not matter how they got here; they are children who need to have their rights asserted.  I have huge question marks over surrogacy.  It is a profit-making enterprise that exploits women in poor countries in many cases.  These are often women of colour.  I have huge issues with it.  The point is that when children are born and brought back to this country, they have to be dealt with.<\/p><p>The third issue is the retrospective issuing of birth certificates and other documents to record both same-sex parents to allow them to go back.<\/p><p>In the spirit of saying that he is trying to get agreement, the Minister would give people succour and comfort by accepting the amendment rather than saying he will oppose it because he is dealing with it in another way.  We have all been in these positions.  If we took the Minister's line of argument and withdrew the amendment, he might not come back with the legislation; that is the point.  It could be for many reasons such as him being busy or whatever else.<\/p><p>I wanted to make clear why this is necessary.  LGBT+ people were hugely validated and affirmed by the majority of people in the marriage equality referendum.  It has been shocking that we have not dealt adequately with the practicalities of their lives and made them fully equal families and people in society.  We want to be seen to be including LGBT+ people and their families- their children - in every possible way.  The delays that people have had to endure for the past three years are not acceptable.  This is about children's rights and no matter who their parents are or how they came into the world they should have the same rights as anybody else.  I have mentioned some of the key problems of inheritance, citizenship, leaving the country, getting passports and also parents not feeling that they, themselves, are registered and recognised as the parents of these children. <\/p><p>The Minister knows we are doing this because we have been inundated with requests about it.  This might seem like a minor issue, but there are many families in these positions and they have contacted all of us.  It would be wrong to leave here tonight and withdraw an amendment because we accept an assurance.  We should vote for the amendment and hope it is dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100059#MMM00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1531334700,"counter":565,"content":"<p>If, when the original Act was passed, we had included the need for a report within six months of commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, we would be in a different situation now because presumably the issue would have been spotted six months in rather than three years in and it could have been rectified rather than the delay that we have.  That is the purpose of inserting these kinds of report mechanisms into legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The issue dealt with in subsection (b) of the amendment is probably the most substantive of the points in the report.  We understand the situation with subsection (a): it is an attempt to put political pressure on the Government, the Civil Service, the committees, etc., to progress the assisted human reproduction Bill.  It is not fair to characterise it as attempting to legislate for things that happen outside the State.  As Deputy Coppinger said, it is a question of how we treat children who come into this world as a consequence of activities outside the State.  We have the power to legislate for that as opposed to clinics in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  Subsection (b) refers to procedures \"outside the State or otherwise outside the remit of the Act\".  In particular that deals with the issue of home inseminations which is not dealt with by the original legislation at all.  It is a huge area where for reasons of cost and so on many people have home inseminations and are not catered for.  While inserting this does not resolve it, it means that in six months we will get a report on what is being done to resolve it.  If it has not been resolved in six months, it will create a pressure for the Government.  Therefore, it will focus minds on the need to deal with this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100059#MMM00300","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1531334700,"counter":566,"content":"<p>The amendment is well intentioned and I share the proposers' view that the delay of three years has been unacceptable.  Some of it was reasonable because the infrastructure needed to be put in place.  The legislation made some significant changes.  I share the frustration over how long this has taken and I acknowledge that it is not all-encompassing - Parts 1 and 2.  I also share the desire to keep the Government under pressure because there have been too many delays.<\/p>  <p>  My concern with the amendment is that essentially we would insert into legislation a call on the Government to report on different legislation that does not exist yet.  That does not seem to be helpful.  We have all been contacted by people who have been trying to figure out what the two separate Bills do.  There are Parts 1 and 2 of the Child and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill, which will be commenced after tonight because I think everyone is supporting it.<\/p>  <p>  There is also what we are dealing with in the Joint Committee on Health, which is the assisted human reproduction Bill.  Only today did we sign off on our pre-legislative scrutiny report which will come back to the House for consideration.  I am concerned that the reason there is confusion and, therefore, the reason there is a lot of understandable anxiety among people affected by these two Bills is that they are very close.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill deals with cases where the intending mother gives birth.  Therefore it works for straight couples, lesbian couples and a woman on her own.  It does not work for surrogacy or for a man on his own or for two gay men.<\/p><p>That is not a clear and it is confusing.  I fully accept the amendment is not meant to cause any confusion but my concern is it will because it would legislatively link the two Bills and they are separate.<\/p> <p> I have a second concern which is a small team of officials is dealing with all of this.  We are dealing with it at the health committee but the committee's schedule is full.  There are a lot of things going on in health.  The first meeting of the health committee next term will be on the eighth amendment and our second meeting will be on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and so forth.  There are many different issues.  Seeking a report will take up time and could conceivably slow down the passage of the next Bill which we are all behind.  We all want to see as much as possible.  I fully support the intent of the amendment.  It is not trying to confuse but it could slow things down.  Linking the Act with a Bill on which we are still at heads of Bill stage will lead to further confusion.  It is up to the proposers of the amendment to do what they want.  What we all want is to keep up the pressure.  If the Minister were to consider committing to the House this evening that in the next six months rather than us giving a report which will be filed and on which there might not be any debate, he could give some D&aacute;il time to discuss this issue again.  We could go back and forth with him.  The pressure would be maintained with the added benefit that we could all stand up and have a go if it was not being addressed.  We can do the same in committee.  A report will come and go.  I wanted to put that suggestion forward.  <\/p> <p> If the amendment is pressed, Fianna F&aacute;il will abstain for those reasons.  I fully support what the amendment is trying to do but it will add to the confusion and slow everything down, which none of us wants.  It is up to the Minister.

I am advised that the best way to deal with this is to put the new section we proposed in our amendment into section 7 of the 1994 Act, and replace the word \"section\" in that amendment with the word \"Act\".  The rules of the House do not permit me to do that tonight but I will suggest an amendment along those lines to our Seanad spokesperson when the matter goes to the Seanad.  In the meantime, I do not propose to oppose the Government's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100061#OOO00500","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1531335900,"counter":592,"content":"<p>We have been the recipients of advice from the Minister, which we have to take cognisance of because it is important that, in our desire to implement legislation, we do not make the task more difficult for the people whose condition we are trying to improve.  The Labour Court has considered the question of the condition of an employee being demeaned, and some detriment being caused to his or her conditions of employment, if he or she asserts a legal right including the making of a complaint in good faith.  The Minister has been very generous in informing us of all the issues that arise but the question arises of penalisation.  We assume that a change of working hours without consultation is detrimental and is an adverse act to an employee, which could have consequences.  I was aware of the case of O'Neill <i>v<\/i>. Toni &amp;amp; Guy on the question of shifting the burden of proof, which is somewhat analogous to the shifting of the burden of proof in section 85A of the Employment Equality Act.<\/p><p>We want to make sure there is equivalence regarding what we pass here.  The question to be grappled with is whether section 26A imposes a different standard or onus of proof.  In the natural course of events, and in accordance with other statutory enactments relevant to employment law rights and obligations, the complainant or employee would make an complaint pertaining to, or under, a particular section or subsection of an Act or regulation relevant to the particular employment.  One then needs to establish, by way of background circumstances, any facts or evidence possible to deduce or infer from the presentation of the complainant or employee that led to his or her detriment or dismissal or to any other sanction.  Then the burden of proof shifts and it is up to the employer to establish to the satisfaction of the Labour Court, the Workplace Relations Commission or the Circuit Court, on the balance of probability standard, that is, the civil standard of proof, that the complaint made by the employee did not lead to the complainant or employee being dismissed.  We have to be concerned if anything passed in this House gives rise to difficulties in construction, at a practical level, at the Labour Court or anywhere else.  We rely heavily on such tribunals and precedent.  <\/p><p>Deputy O'Dea has proposed that we look at this to see if we can improve it or bring forward an alternative to deal with this issue and ensure equivalence and I would support it being explored in the Seanad, where more time will be available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100061#OOO00600","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1531335900,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I understand that Deputy O'Dea has received legal advice and I will defer to that.

It is important, though, in legislation we pass here that we try to have an overview of how this might impact on employers and employees.

My officials and I thought that could create legal uncertainty and be problematic in practice.  The advice was clear that the amendments should be deleted from the Bill.  I also instructed my officials to seek the views of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court on the same amendments.  A copy of that communication was circulated to Deputies two weeks ago.<\/p>  <p>  If we go back to square one, a penalisation provision never existed in the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.  We did not introduce it because we were lobbied by anybody - ICTU, Mandate or IBEC.  We did it because it was the right thing to do.  Employees need to feel safe in the knowledge that they can exercise their rights under employment law without any fear of penalisation.  As we were starting from scratch, we found that the strongest anti-penalisation provision exists in Irish employment law, namely the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012.  An adjudication officer has to decide in all cases under the 1994 Act whether they are well founded or not.  The burden of proof for that Act is established burden of proof across all other employment rights legislation.  The Opposition amendment has inserted a second burden of proof into this penalisation provision and that is where the problem lies.<\/p>  <p>  If this amendment ended up in the final Act, it would be bad law to have two different levels of burden of proof within the one Act.  It would not be possible to adjudicate on one without opening up a liability of being adjudicated upon by a judicial review or appeal on the other.  We would end up going around in circles.  The person who has the ability to take the case against the employer, most likely, would end up having no recourse to justice.  I think it was Deputy Penrose who mentioned Hobson's choice on Report Stage.  He said this amendment would create a Hobson's choice for the adjudication officer because, no matter what burden of proof the decision was made upon, the losing side would say that the wrong one was used and that the other one should have been used.  We would again be going around in circles.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies no other employment legislation has two burdens of proof.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned the Unfair Dismissals Act a fortnight ago.  That is not the Act we are amending but even if it was, it still has only one burden of proof.  By introducing a second standard of proof, the penalisation provisions will be unworkable, whichever standard of proof the WRC adjudicator or the Labour Court relies upon.  It will be open to the aggrieved party, who most likely will be the employer, to challenge the decision by judicial review on the grounds that the adjudicator or the Labour Court should have relied on the other burden of proof instead of the one that they did rely on.  We will go around in circles once again and have no clear way for an employee who has a particular grievance against an employer to get justice.  The second standard of proof really creates a problem.  To leave the relevant part of the Bill stand as it does today, with two different standards of proof will render what was potentially going to be a strong measure to protect employees completely unworkable and ineffective.  That is why the amendments still stand and I am pressing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100062#PPP00400","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1531336200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Are we on amendments Nos. 3 and 4?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100062#PPP00500","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1531336200,"counter":599,"content":"<p>No, we have to take them separately.

That is a fairly important provision.  It is pretty central to employees' rights legislation and as I say, it is repeated practically word for word in this Bill.<\/p><p>Unfortunately this Bill provides an exception, as does the 1997 Act.  It provides that if the work can be designated as &quot;casual&quot;, then there will be no compensation if the person is not called upon and does not get the hours for which they made themselves available.  I think that is a pretty serious issue, because the term &quot;casual work&quot; is not defined in the Bill.  Different people may have different ideas of what does or does not constitute casual work.  We have no way of knowing how the term &quot;casual work&quot; is going to be interpreted.  If it is interpreted narrowly, that is fine.  If it is interpreted broadly, it will dismantle a good deal of the protection which is provided for employees in that section.<\/p><p>Deputy Penrose proposed one possible solution on Committee Stage.  It was ruled out of order, unfortunately, on the grounds that it might constitute a charge on the Exchequer.  I am suggesting this amendment to the Minister as an alternative way to deal with the matter.  We should draft regulations in which we try our very best to set out as exhaustively as possible those situations which can be designated as casual work.  We probably will not be able to encompass everything, but I think we will take in the vast majority of situations because most people have a general idea of what does and does not constitute casual work.  I am recommending to the Minister that she accept the amendment.  That would oblige her to draw up the appropriate regulations, and it will prevent the possibility of the term &quot;casual work&quot;, which as I say is not defined in the section, being used in a way that will be too broadly interpreted, thereby depriving people of compensation when they make themselves available for work which does not become available for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100064#RRR00100","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1531337400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>In principle I have no problem with regulations being drafted.

The critical thing here is that this legislation is implemented as quickly as possible.  This amendment seeks to have regulations drafted before the Bill actually comes into operation.  That is where I have a serious problem.  How long before the drafting of these regulations actually takes place?  Deputy O'Dea has already said that his party is going to table amendments in the Seanad.  That will obviously slow things up.

The debate that took three hours was on the very same issue.  I know the Chairman had to do it, but we have had the wholesale ruling out of all Opposition amendments to a Bill seeking to reform employment laws in general terms and not specifically directed at the State.  None of the amendments was specifically directed at the State.  This seems to be unprecedented and wrong on principle, and it will have to be looked at in the House.<\/p>  <p>  If such an approach were to be applied across the board, we could not amend land law because the State is a landowner, we could not amend tort law because the State is protected by vicarious liability, we could not amend contract law because the State enters into contracts and we could not amend criminal law because the State must pay garda&iacute; to police the criminal laws.  This issue must be addressed.  It cannot be the case that the relevant constitutional provisions and the Standing Orders designed to inform the Constitution were ever intended to block anyone bar the Government from contributing in any meaningful way to the legislative process in such a draconian fashion.  The rest of us are being relegated to mere observer status.<\/p>  <p>  This is important.  I agree with Deputy Brady as various unions have been in contact with us.  We saw what happened to Dunnes Stores workers, which was the trigger to try to deal with this matter.  Certainly during the downturn there has been increasing casualisation of labour.  I was very eager this would be encompassed in the legislation.  It was germane to the entire issue and went to the heart of what we are trying to fix.  The last thing I want to do is delay the implementation of legislation.  If it goes around in rings it could be next October or November by the time it gets to be signed by the President, whoever he or she is.  That would be a significant delay.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate what Deputy O'Dea is trying to do, but we will have to wait and see what the Minister has to say.  In the context of the previous amendment, the last thing we want to do is go around in rings and come back in a circle to where we started, making no progress for the very employees who are the most vulnerable and who are exposed.  None of them will thank us.  If we can get the legislation 99% right that will be great, and if we find a 1% lacuna it will be very easy to introduce an amendment.  Under the new political dispensation the amendment could be implemented or applied very quickly.  However, if there is a 100% lacuna because we fail to act, it will be the worst of all worlds for the very employees we are trying to protect and whose protections we are trying to enhance.  I agree with Deputy Brady that we had better see whether we can make progress as quickly as possible on this legislation, notwithstanding that Deputy O'Dea's point is well made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100065#SSS00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1531337700,"counter":609,"content":"<p>If it is Deputy O'Dea's view that the Bill will not apply to casual workers it is misinterpretation, because the only derogation regarding casual employment in the Bill is with regard to zero-hour contracts.  Every other part of the Bill applies to every other worker.  An employer may employ an individual on zero-hour contracts if the work is truly of a casual nature.  I distributed some of the examples to which I was referring after Committee Stage.  This provision has been in operation in the Organisation of Working Time Act for the past 20 years and it has not led to employees being categorised or miscategorised as casual workers.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to remember it is simply not the case that employees on casual contracts do not have employment rights.  In a recent high-profile case involving an RT&Eacute; employee, the individual was found to have been discriminatorily dismissed on the grounds of age while she was on a casual contract with the organisation.  The Workplace Relations Commission found in her favour and duly awarded her &euro;50,000 compensation.  In fairness, and we have had conversations about this on other days, the nature of work is changing and jobs that would have been regarded as casual do not exist any more.  For argument's sake, there used to be something called a cattle drover, who used to drive cattle from one town to another and from one fair to another.  That job no longer exists.  Similarly, there are roles in the new world and new economy that we probably have not thought of yet.  We are trying to predict exactly what roles will exist in future and, in trying to do so, provide regulations that will adhere to those new roles, which we do not have.  It would be unwise for us to do that.<\/p>  <p>  It is not good practice in any legislation, be it in primary or secondary law, to define anything other than essential definitions when the plain ordinary meaning of a word or term is capable of being understood by the bodies that adjudicate on them.  The WRC and the Labour Court are capable of examining all of the circumstances of particular cases and then making appropriate judgments as to whether particular arrangements are genuinely casual.  It is far better to leave it to the statutory bodies charged with securing compliance with the law than tying both their hands behind their back and defining it in legislation.  The most appropriate and effective approach, as this is, has worked very well for the past 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  To return to some points made by Deputies on Committee Stage, it is simply incorrect to suggest the Bill will do nothing for people on if-and-when contracts.  The banded hours provision, for example, will apply to people on if-and-when contracts, which means where people have worked an average number of hours over the 12 month reference period, they will be entitled to be placed on a band of hours that reflects the reality of the hours worked.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments to the Terms of Employment (Information) Act will require employers to inform employees by the fifth day of their commencing employment what the employer reasonably expects the normal length of the working day and working week will be.  Employers will also be required to state the expected duration of the contract where the contract is temporary or fixed term, and employees on if-and-when contracts will also benefit from the new minimum compensation provisions where they are given notice of hours of work but do not receive those hours of work.  Employees on if-and-when contracts will also benefit from the anti-penalisation provisions, so if an employer penalises them for exercising their rights under either Act they will be entitled to pursue the matter to the WRC.<\/p>  <p>  The suggestion was also made on Committee Stage that a person on an if-and-when contract of employment had no recourse to employment rights bodies.  It is well established in the jurisprudence of the constitutional courts and the Labour Court that they will look behind the written terms of the contract to establish the true nature of any arrangement.  This particular fact was addressed by the Labour Court in the case entitled Ticketline trading as Ticketmaster versus a young lady called Sarah Mullen.  In this case, the court accepted on evidence that while the written contract of employment was of the if-and-when type with no mutuality of obligation, the contract was operated on the basis that the employee was required to be available for work at all times and was, thus, entitled to the protection of the Organisation of Working Time Act and, in particular, the compensation provision provided for under section 18 of that Act.  She also won her case.  For all of these reasons, it would be highly unwise for me to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100065#SSS00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1531337700,"counter":610,"content":"<p>It is not my intention to slow down the Bill.

To argue that anything up to 12 months is seasonal means it is a funny kind of season.  A six-month period is much more appropriate.  If a worker gets a job and is guaranteed a certain number of hours but does not receive them, or works more than what was given in the first place, a six-month period would be long enough to reflect that position and the band workers should be in.  After six months, workers should be allowed to contest the matter.  This particularly affects young workers who start on a job and they do not expect to have to wait for that process.

That is Sinn F&eacute;in's compromise position as my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, brought forward legislation a couple of years ago in which he sought a six-month look-back period in line with the study carried out by the University of Limerick.  One of its key recommendations was a six-month look-back period.<\/p>  <p>  Members may be aware there was a cross-party committee hearing on Deputy Cullinane's Bill and it produced a cross-party recommendation for 12 months.  One of the main reasons put forward for a 13-month period by the Government and others concerned unfair dismissals legislation, as an employee had to be in place for 12 months in such cases.  I argued successfully that 12 months was sufficient as once a worker has been employed for 12 months and a day, the unfair dismissals legislation would apply.  I am not happy with the 12-month period with respect to unfair dismissal and it must be brought back but that is another day's work and we cannot change that here because it is not in this legislation.  Ultimately, it will need to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  In an ideal scenario I would like to see this set at six months but there is a compromise position at 12 months that involved a big row-back from the Government's initial position of 18 months.  A six-month period was in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill brought forward by Deputy Cullinane, who successfully focused the debate on the need to put legislation in place to ban zero-hour and if-and-when contracts.  It ultimately led us to this debate today.  We know the red tape that was put in place in the form of issuing money messages in the process of debating that legislation.  We have moved on our position but if the six-month provision is to be pushed, we will certainly not have any difficulties with that.

I listened to the Deputies' concerns on Second Stage and I am therefore happy to be able to say we compromised and reduced the reference period from 18 months, our initial offering, to 12 months with respect to banded hours.  The reference period was selected for several reasons.  As Deputy Brady noted, it is the normal length of a business cycle and it should be sufficiently long enough to take account of seasonal fluctuations and the normal peaks and troughs of most businesses.  It is an easy divider that will help make this more workable both for employees and employers.  It is the reference period recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in its report following the scrutiny of the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' Bill on banded hours contracts.  The Bill also proposed the introduction of a banded hours arrangement.  Deputies will recall there was considerable support for the 12-month reference period during Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to remember the look-back period is identical to the look-forward period.<\/p><p>If the look-back period was reduced, then the look-forward period would be reduced too.  Therefore, if the amendments were carried an employee would only be guaranteed to be put on a band of hours, whatever the band of hours, from the previous six months for the following six months.  I hope that, on balance, the Deputy would agree that a 12 month reference period offers better protection from the employee's point of view.<\/p> <p> Deputies might recall that the University of Limerick study recommended a reference period of six months.  However, when the study was put out to public consultation there was a genuine and overwhelmingly strong response from many quarters highlighting the difficulties or unintended consequences that would arise.  For example, in a seaside hotel in the west of Ireland the levels of business fluctuate significantly between the high summer season and the quiet winter season.  A review of an employee's hours over the period from May to September would produce a different result to a review of the same worker's hours over the six month period from October to April.  An employee who works 35 hours per week during the high season but only ten hours during the winter low season could put in a request at the end of the high season showing that, on average, she worked 35 hours per week.  Consequently, she would be required to be placed on an appropriate band of hours for the coming six months, which would coincide with the low season.  However, during that period the work may not be available and the employer may not have enough work to justify giving that employee 35 hours of work.  The likelihood is that either that employee or other employees would have to be let go to satisfy the 35 hour look-back period.  That is not something any of us want.<\/p> <p> The purpose of this measure is to be able to establish in principle the actual hours that people are working and for it to be reflected in their contract.  The purpose is not to manipulate it or make it better for employees and worse for employers or better for employers and worse for employees.  It is simply to reflect the reality of what people are working under their contracts.  It is for that reason I cannot accept amendment No. 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100066#TTT00700","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531338900,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531338900,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<\/p><blockquote>In page 15, to delete lines 11 and 12.<\/blockquote><p>On Committee Stage, Deputy Joan Collins, who proposed the amendment along with Deputy Clare Daly, stated that it was based on EU Directive 97\/81\/EC on part-time work, which this country had not implemented yet.  The Deputies were mistaken in this regard because Ireland has fully transposed the directive.  That was confirmed by a 2003 report on the implementation of the directive undertaken by the European Commission.  The Attorney General's office has confirmed same and that the amendment is unnecessary for this reason.<\/p><p>Under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, an employer cannot treat a part-time employee less favourably than a full-time employee.  The statutory code of practice states that an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time work or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The code was developed by the former Labour Relations Commission following consultation with the social partners.  The code is admissible in evidence in any and all relevant legal proceedings.  The code sets out the best practice and detailed arrangements that should apply to a request by employees to transfer from part-time to full-time work or to increase their working time should the opportunity arise as well as a request to transfer from full-time to part-time work.  The code also provides guidance to employers about career opportunities for part-time workers and the provision of information by employers to employees and employee representative bodies or union representatives about the availability of part-time and full-time positions.  We believe that is the appropriate way to deal with these issues.<\/p><p>It is important to remember that there are costs involved in hiring an employee.  Most employers are rational and, therefore, will offer the extra hours to people who they know can do the job, in particular, existing employees.  The code of practice in the 2001 Act already provides sufficient protections for part-time employees in this regard.<\/p><p>The Committee Stage amendment tabled by the Deputies imposes obligations on employers that are too prescriptive.  The general manager of a cleaning company &ndash; she happens to be a lady in Meath &ndash; wrote to me to say that the provision will not allow her to assign hours according to ability and experience.  She said that the provision, if enacted, represents micro-management of her employment contracts by Government and she finds it wholly unacceptable.<\/p><p>I will set out a practical example.  Let us suppose an employer with a franchise supermarket has, say, 50 employees, made up of 15 full-time and 35 part-time employees.  A member of staff who works ten hours per week cannot work a particular week because of college examinations.  Those ten hours would be deemed to be surplus hours.  Clearly it would make no sense for the employer to hire a new employee to do those ten hours.  The employer will offer the hours to existing staff.  However, to require the employer to do so by statute is unnecessary.  It also creates the risk of unintended consequence since employees not offered the hours could, and potentially will, seek redress if they do not receive any of the surplus hours.<\/p><p>If we create a new right in law we must set out in statute how that right is to be exercised and how the employer can defend himself or herself against a claim.  If the employer offers these hours to a new Irish national employee first, is the employer leaving himself or herself open to a race discrimination claim from non-Irish employees or <i>vice versa<\/i>?<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the amendment, as carried by the committee, would cause operational issues and difficulties for the employment rights bodies adjudicating on this issue.  As it stands, the provision allows no room for flexibility.  What if specific skills are required?  That is not specified in the amendment.  For example, a hospital porter should not, and would be unable to, take over from a nurse without the required qualifications.  Yet, under the provision, as currently drafted, an employer of that hospital porter would be obliged to offer the nursing vacancy to the hospital porter.<\/p><p>The amendment from Deputy Collins and Deputy Daly assumes that all part-time workers want increased hours but actually there are many people who do not.  According to the latest CSO labour force survey, some 75% of part-time employees describe themselves as unwilling and unavailable to work additional hours.  Working more hours could potentially affect many people's social welfare entitlements.  Specifically, one important condition of the jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit being paid to current part-time workers is that recipients are obliged to continue to look for full-time work.  If an employer offers a part-time worker increased hours &ndash; the employer would be obliged to do so by this law if passed &ndash; and the worker refused to take the hours, we would have to give serious consideration to bringing forward provisions to provide that the employer must notify the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection of such a situation.<\/p><p>A similar situation arose in Belgium whereby a comparable provision was transposed into law.  In that case an employer who offers additional hours of work to the employee who is in receipt of social welfare must notify the social welfare authorities if the employee refuses to work those extra hours.  That creates a whole conundrum of issues involving people who are working part-time and who potentially do not want to work more hours.  I genuinely know this is not what the Deputies were trying to do.<\/p><p>For all the foregoing reasons I have moved the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100067#UUU00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1531338900,"counter":621,"content":"<p>The Minister's explanation was a graphic example of making a mountain out of a molehill.  In fact this amendment was an incredibly positive measure and entirely in keeping with the EU part-time workers directive.  It serves to enhance the security and opportunity to work extra hours for part-time workers should they desire to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the directive and the prohibition on part-time workers being treated less favourably than full-time workers.  She referred to opting to transfer between full-time and part-time employment and so on.  These points are utterly irrelevant for the purposes of these two lines.  The text is carefully written.  It provides that in the event of hours becoming available an employer shall be required to offer any surplus hours to existing part-time employees first.<\/p>  <p>  None of the scenarios that the Minister outlined about people on social welfare and people who do not want to do extra hours apply.  In my former job everyone knew who those people were.  If there were extra hours, everyone knew who might want them as well.  The Minister says that an employer is sensible &ndash; of course costs will come into it &ndash; and will offer the hours to existing employees.  I agree with her.  That is the normal situation.  In any healthy employment, that scenario will arise.  Therefore, inserting this clause in the legislation will not have any negative impact on that healthy employer-employee relationship.<\/p>  <p>  The reason to include the provision relates to other scenarios that have arisen, for example, the likes of the Dunnes Stores dispute.  The idea is to protect people whose faces did not fit, perhaps the outspoken worker down at the back who encouraged other people to go on strike.  That person may have found that access to hours were impacted upon and she was being treated less favourably in that sense.  The reason was not because the person was part-time but because she was a union activist.<\/p>  <p>  Essentially, these are the very circumstances behind the Ryanair dispute at the moment.  It is a similar scenario because what is being sought is a master seniority list.  In other words, a transparent mechanism available for changes in hours of work and for transfers between bases and so on.  Ryanair wants to keep that because it wants to have the power to send people to different bases and deny them holidays in order to keep them compliant.  This is a similar scenario that can be used.  Let us suppose a worker wants to avail of extra hours to ensure security.<\/p><p>We should remind ourselves that last month the European Economic and Social Committee stated its view that the directive should open up real opportunities for workers in non-standard jobs, which is important, to move to standard terms of employment appropriate to their qualifications.  It said that this requires minimum rights for temporary workers to be moved into open-ended employment or to upgrade from part time to full time where there are places or hours in the company and the worker has the necessary skills and qualifications.<\/p> <p> Is the Minister honestly trying to tell us that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, thinks that it will be forced to uphold a claim when, say, tomorrow Ryanair does not have a pilot to fly the flight and a baggage handler is going to offer to do it for it?  Does she think that the WRC will say that is a reasonable expectation for that worker, any more than a hospital porter thinks that he or she will take over the doctor's job?  Be serious.  It is a nonsense to suggest the WRC is saying that anyone expects that based on this wording.  It says \"appropriate to their qualifications\" and necessary skills or qualifications are implied, they do not need to be spelled out.  However, if they did need to be spelled out, I ask the Minister why she did not insert that wording?  This is critically important to workers in this State, and against the backdrop of the research done by Social Justice Ireland which says that more than 104,000 people at work are at risk of poverty.  Some of those people want extra hours.  Maybe their face does not fit.  The Minister is absolutely right that in most cases, if the hours are there in a healthy work place, the workers will get it.  This only refers to a minority of cases but it is so important and just having it there will act as a corrective for those employers who might want to exercise discrimination against their workers.  It is incredibly important.  For me, it was the most positive amendment to come out of Committee Stage and it would be appalling to overturn it at this stage.  It would be incredibly harsh of the Minister to do that.  If she had taken the discussions on board she would have re-worded it if there was a problem with the wording.<\/p> <p> I am also aware of the email correspondence where the Department sought the WRC's advice and opinions on the amendments brought in by the committee.  The WRC commented on many things but it did not comment on this one.  It had to be emailed repeatedly by the Department which kept asking if this would be a problem and in fact in one of the emails the response was that it did not believe it was.  The WRC kept receiving emails asking whether it did not think it was a problem.  Finally, we have wording that there was a phone call with the WRC and it said that it could cause huge problems and a burden for it.  No workers will take cases saying that they were a baggage handler and wanted to fly the plane and they were not given the hours.  If they were stupid enough to do that, no WRC would uphold it.  It is utterly ludicrous.  <\/p> <p> There is a problem here.  We have to look at it in the context of the rising number of disputes.  The legislation that we bring in can be important.  There is currently an issue in the Minister's own constituency with workers in Etihad Airlines.  Workers were given a letter under a collective redundancy situation and are now in negotiations.  They are vulnerable workers whose company is failing to recognise the union.  People with no expertise are supposed to go in and represent all their colleagues in a life-and-death situation regarding their jobs.  The company is failing to sit down with the union that those people have joined.  That is the consequence of the type of bullying which this legislation and the clause that we are discussing is meant to protect workers from.  I feel very strongly that it has to stay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100067#UUU00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531339500,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Before I move to the second round of contributions, does anyone wish to come in for the first time?

There is a contradiction here.  Recent statistics show that more than half of part-time workers in employment are living in poverty.  Part of the reason for that is low pay but also precarious hours and part-time work itself.  Say someone is in a job in Tesco - I know it pretty well because I shop in its Ballyfermot store and we supported the pickets around the country recently - and extra hours become available for some reason, for example, there might be a busy period or the World Cup is on, if those hours are not offered to the part-time worker and a new employee is taken on instead and the hours are given to him or her, it penalises the person who is already at work and who needs the extra hours to exist.<\/p>  <p>  There is another thing that the Minister for Employment and Social Protection must consider on top of everything Deputy Daly said.  During the last D&aacute;il, while Deputy Joan Burton was Minister, this State told lone parents that their lone parent allowance would be affected when their children reached seven years of age and the parents would have to go out and seek work.  This was portrayed as a positive initiative to get people into the workplace rather than seeing themselves dependent on social welfare in the long term.  As the hours they work are reflected in the payments they get, then they need more hours.  Many of them need more hours in work to sustain themselves.  What is happening is that lone parents are on a certain number of hours, but extra hours are being offered to new workers who come in rather than increasing the existing workers and as a result they become more dependent on the Minister's Department.  The same is true of things such as family income supplement, FIS, payments for workers who need a subsidy from the State because they are being paid so little.  The Minister might be cutting off her nose to spite her face by not supporting this amendment which does two things.  It protects workers and undermines the ability and the willingness of employers to penalise workers whose face does not fit or who are too bold because they have joined a union, taken action or spoke up for themselves.  That can be used to penalise them.  Unless one is in a good unionised job, we have all seen how employers can overlook people who should be next in line when they offer extra hours.  The original amendment offered a protection for employees.  The Minister thinks that it is a bit hard on employers.  That is why IBEC probably lobbied the Minister to remove it, arguing that it wanted to be much more flexible.  I am sure that the Minister will respond to my accusation that she was lobbied by IBEC to introduce this amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The original amendment goes to the heart of the spirit of what this Bill is about.  If the Minister removes it, she will be tearing the guts out of the Bill.  I plead with her not to remove it and with the other Deputies to vote to retain the original amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100068#VVV01100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1531339500,"counter":633,"content":"<p>The Minister proposes to delete a section of the Bill which would oblige the employer to offer newly available hours to existing employees.  There are many part-time workers in this country who would want this provision to remain in the Bill and many more who would want this, if they were aware of this debate.  The worst and most exploitative employers will be watching this carefully and will be on the Minister's side.  They will be cheering her on and hoping that this House agrees to delete a proposed obligation on employers to offer newly available hours to existing employees.<\/p><p>This is an important matter.  There will not just be a \"T&aacute;\" or \"N&iacute;l\" vote on it.  A full vote will be called for and the bells will be rung.  We want to see where every Deputy in this House stands on this issue.<\/p> <p> When the Minister spoke on her amendment, she wheeled out a number of theoretical situations that might occur.  Before we look at theoretical situations, we should look at the real situations that are occurring in this country every day, every week and every month.  Employers have the power to hold over their workforce the threat of giving any additional work that becomes available to someone else.  They are going for new hires rather than offering work to existing employees who speak up, challenge what their managers say or try to join or organise unions in their workplaces.  That is happening in the real world every day, every week and every month.  It has to be combatted and that is what this modest proposal aims to do.  The Minister is ignoring what is happening in the real world.  Instead, she is wheeling out theoretical examples.<\/p> <p> The Minister raised the possibility that if this Bill is passed as it currently stands, when a nurse goes abroad and leaves a nursing position vacant in a hospital, the management of the hospital might have to offer the job to a porter rather than hiring a new nurse.  She knows this is nonsense.  Everybody in the House knows it is nonsense.  It has been deconstructed by other speakers in the course of this debate.  Why is the Minister trying to bring such nonsensical arguments before the House?  Her reliance on such arguments is a real indication of the weakness of her position.  There is no way on earth the WRC would stand over such a situation.  By the way, there is no way the hospital porter would apply for a nurse's job in the first place, unless we have madmen among the workforce, rather than the sensible people who keep this country running on a daily basis while nonsense like this is trundled out in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> The Minister has referred to several scenarios in which it would make sense for employers to offer additional hours to existing employees, which is what happens in many workplaces up and down the country.  If it makes sense in the vast majority of scenarios, why is it a problem, threat or danger to provide in legislation that such an offer has to be made, as a means of combating the more exploitative employers who pursue policies of this kind?  We all know there has been a major campaign behind the scenes.  We all know that IBEC has been lobbying hard against amendments like this.  We all know which employers will benefit most if the Minister is successful in her proposal to reverse the Committee Stage amendment.  It should not be taken out; it should stay in.  If we cannot get unanimity - I do not think we will - there should be a vote on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100068#VVV01200","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531340100,"counter":635,"content":"<p>The amendment that was made on Committee Stage goes to the heart of what we are trying to achieve as we seek to protect some of the most vulnerable workers in our society.  According to CSO figures that were published recently, some 105,051 people who are in employment are living in poverty.  The amendment that the Minister is now seeking to reverse cuts to the heart of the matter by seeking to ensure additional work that becomes available is offered to people in precarious employment and people who depend on family income supplement on a weekly basis to be able to put meals on the table.<\/p>  <p>  I think the Minister's proposal to have the amendment that was made on Committee Stage reversed has been introduced on foot of the intensive IBEC lobby which has been mentioned by a number of Deputies.  If her proposal is accepted, it will affect vulnerable employees and drive down conditions and wages.  Some employers are punishing staff who might be trying to hold their employers and their management to account.  Employees in Dunnes Stores have been instrumental in the campaign to ban if-and-when contracts and zero-hour contracts, for example, by bringing the company to the WRC.  We are aware that staff have been penalised there.  By leaving this amendment in the Bill, we can prevent employers from penalising staff in this way.  I will give an example of how staff are being penalised.  Rather than offering any extra hours that are available to staff who have fought long and hard for their current pay and conditions, these employers are taking on new staff on lesser pay and conditions and giving them the additional hours first and foremost.  The amendment that was made on Committee Stage will stop all of that.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to refer to interesting correspondence regarding the WRC that has been provided by the Minister.  The Department contacted the WRC time and again to ascertain whether it intended to comment on the amendment requiring employers \"to offer any surplus hours to existing part-time employees first\".  As far as I can see from the correspondence, the WRC did not respond to those contacts.  One official who had heard nothing further from the WRC wrote that they had been speaking to Mr. Foley, who is the chairperson of the Labour Court.  This official reported that Mr. Foley had said that this provision would lead to a certain level of chaos at a practical level, but had also made the point that the Labour Court would have no difficulty in operating it.  Of course there might be a little bit of initial chaos, as Mr. Foley put it, in the rolling out of this measure in employment up and down the State, but it is critical to note that the Labour Court would have absolutely no difficulty implementing it.  The correspondence goes on to make it clear that Mr. Foley was speaking as an individual and not on behalf of the Labour Court as a statutory body.  The piece of correspondence in question conveys clearly that the views circulated and the observations provided are those of the chairman and not of the Labour Court as a statutory body.  In summary, no concern has been expressed by the WRC, the Labour Court has not expressed any concern about this amendment and an individual from the Labour Court has said the court would have no difficulty in operating this provision.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of an amendment that was made on Committee Stage, this Bill provides that \"an employer shall be required to offer any surplus hours\" that are available.  The word that is used is \"offer\", rather than \"give\".  There is no emphasis on giving anybody anything.  Many employees who are trying their best to get additional hours are being precluded from doing so by the red tape and penalisation that exists.  As Mandate has put it, the Government's attempt to scupper this provision by deleting it would pull the heart out of what we are trying to do to deal with precarious employment and if-and-when contracts.  As I have said, the CSO has categorised 105,051 citizens as being in employment while living in poverty.  I am totally opposed to the Government's attempt to delete the subsection that was added to this Bill on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister reflects on the views of Deputies, on the silence coming from the WRC and on the views of the chairperson of the Labour Court.  Interestingly, the Labour Court as a statutory body did not have any views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100069#WWW00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1531340700,"counter":636,"content":"<p>It is extremely important that the amendment of the Minister be rejected.  It certainly has IBEC written all over it.  IBEC stated it is deeply concerned about the implications of the proposed banded hours legislation.  It states:<\/p><blockquote><font color=\"#212100\">A further proposed amendment was a suggestion that an employer be obliged to offer any additional available working hours to existing staff before recruiting new employees.  This provision, if it were to be accepted, operating in tandem with the amendment placing the onus of proof on the employer that any changes in working hours were not in fact a form of penalisation under the proposed legislation removes any meaningful control that an employer once had to manage his or her business and staff and places that control in the hands of the State.  Put simply, this is State micromanagement of contracts of employment.<\/font><\/blockquote><p>Our committee recently produced a report on lone parents, the precarious work done by lone parents and the deprivation they experience.  The measure is specifically to deal with the issue of lone parents getting extra hours.<\/p><p>The one-parent family scheme age threshold was reduced to seven years.  The rationale was that it would be an incentive for lone parents to seek more hours at work but they cannot get them.  They are not getting more hours at work.  Thirty percent of Tesco and Dunnes Stores workers want more hours.  Why are they not getting them if it was provided for in legislation?  They are not being offered the extra hours by the employers.<\/p><p>Mandate has won a 3% increase in pay for its members every year for the past five years.  That is 15% over the past five years.  Its long-term members get about &euro;14 per hour.  Where one of those members who is working in Dunnes Stores for 35 hours per week decides to leave, the company prefers to employ someone who can be paid &euro;9.55 per hour rather than giving the hours to a person who has been working in that environment for &euro;14 per hour.  My proposal is about offering the hours to part-time workers who are working generally according to the same scheme.<\/p><p>I worked as a post office clerk.  Seniority was a factor.  I refer to where someone left the job or moved to a different section.  Every six months or so, a list of vacancies would be put up for competition and people would apply.  Eligibility would be based on one's seniority in the job.  It was very simple to operate.  There is nothing chaotic about doing that in any retail store.  The employer knows one's seniority and the number of hours one works.  It would be very simple to publish vacancies every couple of months offering the extra hours.  If a worker working ten hours decided to do 25 or 35 hours at a rate of &euro;14 per hour, which is the rate the union fought for, the ten hours could be offered to somebody else who might be working for 15 but who might prefer to work for ten because it would suit their lifestyle better.  Part-time workers in employment should be offered the hours.<\/p><p>Rather than trying to delete the section, it would have been much more appropriate for the Minister to consider an amendment to clarify the necessary skills or qualifications, if necessary.  I do not believe it is necessary but I am referring to where the Minister believes so.  It is very disingenuous just deleting the actual section because the Minister is abandoning those women, lone parents and workers who want to access the extra hours, who need them and who experience a constant barrage from management if they lift their heads above the water.  We saw that two and a half years ago when the Dunnes Stores workers went on strike.  We saw it with Tesco workers and we see it in other areas.  LloydsPharmacy workers are on zero-hour contracts and do not even have contracted hours.<\/p><p>I urge everybody to reject the Minister's amendment and, if necessary, work with us.  I will try to have an amendment introduced in the Seanad to strengthen the legislation a little if the Minister believes it is necessary.  We certainly should not vote for the Minister's amendment.  As I said, a healthy employer is fine but the legislation is to protect those workers who are not in a healthy environment.  Many retail companies and others are not healthy employers in any shape or form.  I will leave it at that and I might contribute again.  I have a few more points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100070#XXX00100","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1531340700,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I am anxious that we proceed with this important Bill.  I must say, however, that the Government's amendment is quite outrageous.  If it passes, which will obviously depend on the position Fianna F&aacute;il adopts, it will legitimise and encourage the use of hours as a means of control and intimidation and as a means of enhancing exploitation of part-time workers.  That is what this is about.  This goes back to 1997 and the failure of successive Governments to implement the part-time workers directive properly.  Thanks to the select committee amendment, there is an opportunity to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  It is extremely simple.  The Minister's argumentation on having to offer hours to a different worker who is not qualified is patently ridiculous.  I am sure she knows that is the case.  This is about hours for which the part-time worker is qualified.  It is a matter of the hours being available for him or her.  It is extremely simple.  If the Minister seriously had the concern expressed, then she would have tabled an amendment to deal with any associated technical problems.  That is not the issue.  There is no problem with the wording: the Minister is simply bowing, as Deputy Joan Collins pointed out, to the demands of IBEC.  It is all about increasing the power and control of an employer to punish employees, such as those in Dunnes Stores, for standing up for their rights.  It would be utterly shameful for the Government to proceed with the amendment.  It would be utterly shameful to vote for it.  It is illustrative of the real hypocrisy and doublespeak of the Government on the issue of lone parents to talk about encouraging them to work while allowing employers to block them and other workers actively from accessing to the hours they need to secure a sustainable existence and to plan for themselves, their families and lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100070#XXX00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1531340700,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I spoke about this on Committee Stage.  I made the point that any good employer should be implementing these measures without having any statutory obligation to do so.  They should be doing this already.  They should be implementing it in a practical way voluntarily, as would any good employer.  There should be a system in place for implementing it.  Employers will know their existing cohort of part-time employees and the hours they work.  The extra hours are critical for many.  They need them to generate enough money to eat and survive.  The essential thing for workers is putting bread on the table.<\/p>  <p>  There are likely to be some teething problems or practical problems with the implementation of the provision but they are not insurmountable.  All an employer has to do is bring forward a code of conduct, negotiated between the employer and the employees, on how additional hours that become available may be allocated.  It could be negotiated on the basis of seniority.  If somebody is working for the employer for three years, rather than three months, it could be a factor.  If someone with a family is working for only 18 hours per week and five become available, most people would agree to his or her getting those hours rather than me.<\/p><p>If the seniority issue or what is equitable is important, there is a way of dealing with that and to whom the hours should be allocated.  If extra hours become available for a particular task and the employer has an employee whose competence is required, that person will be on the staff so it does not prevent the employer from getting the skill or competence required.  It is only prescriptive from the point of view of offering, as Deputy Brady said.  It is not compulsory and it does not compel employers to give people work.  The employers have to offer it to those people and they can work out a system of doing so.  All they have to do is comply.<\/p> <p> It is a legislative supervisory stick for the employer to ensure that a good environment is generated in terms of the employer-employee relationship.  That should already be there.  It will not be very onerous once a code of practice is put in place for how those surplus hours will be made available to existing part-time employees.  That is important.  Every good employer will know exactly what is going on, if employers are minding their business at all or if the employers are not being vindictive.  If somebody is working 12 or 15 hours and an extra five or six hours become available that could be critical for the person's well-being and economic capacity to survive.  I supported the insertion of the provision on Committee Stage.  I and my Labour Party colleagues find no basis, reasoned or otherwise, put forward here to resile from that position.  It is instructive that we must put this in legislation.  There is a huge number of very decent employers across the country but, unfortunately, there are the few who are in prominent positions or who wield a lot of clout or control who are sometimes the focus of legislative intervention.  Often it is the small and medium sized employers, as the Minister knows, who try their best to comply with the standards one would expect.<\/p> <p> I am very supportive of this provision.  Where the WRC and the Labour Court have intervened in terms of advising us on this legislation, and they do not wish to intervene in the policy area, it was to point out practical difficulties and we certainly take them on board.  That is critical.  However, I do not see anything being pointed out here that is insurmountable from a practical perspective or for the application of the provision.  Obviously there will be teething problems but these can be addressed in the Seanad, with a circumscribing of the various ways of how they can be offered to ensure there are no difficulties.  This is something that good trade union relations with an employer should be able to work out in any event.  I do not anticipate any problems in the workplace.  Of course the problem is where there are non-unionised environments and that is where people are exposed to the bad behaviour of some unscrupulous employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100070#XXX00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531341300,"counter":640,"content":"<p>The Minister's position on this is indefensible.  In putting forward this amendment she has failed to explain how she will protect workers from victimisation.  If this amendment is passed there is absolutely nothing to prevent an employer from making a decision not to give additional hours that might be available to existing part-time employees if the employer is irritated by the fact that those part-time employees have asserted their rights at various points or if the employer feels that the level of seniority of an employee is such that the employee is entitled to better wages and conditions than a new entrant.  The Minister will allow employers to do that.  That is not to say all employers will do it, but there is no doubt that some do it.  They victimise people who stand up for themselves.  If the Minister gets rid of this she will have no mechanism to prevent an employer from victimising people by refusing to give them hours.<\/p>  <p>  The only defence the Minister has given is one that can be addressed in the Seanad, if that is a genuine concern.  As everybody has said the opposition of IBEC to this is not genuine.  It is about wanting to give the whip hand to employers and resenting the fact that existing workers might have certain rights in respect of their employers.  The Minister should be under no illusion about that.  IBEC has offered spurious justification for it, which the Minister has recycled here.  However, if the Minister wishes to address the issue of people having suitable qualifications she can do that in the Seanad.  The spurious argument she is offering can be addressed elsewhere.  Does the Minister support the principle of existing part-time workers being offered any additional hours that are available first, which will improve the situation of people who are on low hours and are the working poor?  They are the 100,000 people, many of them women, who are the working poor whom the Government claims it wishes to activate.  The type of victimisation that I and others are describing happens often and it makes people very angry, bitter and resentful when employers can get away with it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to do better in justifying her position, although I do not believe it is possible to justify it.

I will not be told what to do by anybody - I make up my own mind - but I listen to everybody's arguments.  I am very approachable and accessible.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the EU directive on part-time employment.  It provides that, insofar as possible, when vacancies occur in part-time hours they should be offered to people who are currently doing part-time work.  That is the strong recommendation.  It mentions as far as possible, and some things are possible and some are impossible.  I do not know how widespread this is or the number of employers involved but I am aware that some employers employing part-time workers are inclined, if hours become vacant and if there are part-time workers who are well established, are of long standing and have reached a certain level of wages, to bypass those workers and offer the part-time hours to other people to keep costs down.

Throughout the country there are arrangements in place in workplaces.  Some of them have unions and others have staff who get together and come up with their own plans which suit the employer as well.  Why would an employer pay a full-time worker to do extra hours at double time if he or she has a part-time worker who can paid to do it at single time?  An employer might do that if he or she was in a huff with a part-time worker and wanted to victimise that worker, even if, in doing so, , the employer would be cutting off his or her own nose.  The employer, however, would be disciplining the employee and keeping him or her in a box.<\/p>  <p>  The point that needs to be registered is that there are mechanisms for doing this in place in workplaces throughout the country without this legislation.  All of the good employers do not need to worry about this legislation.  They only need to offer employees additional hours.  There will be other clauses in place as well.  For example, if somebody is not doing their job properly or has refused additional hours on four occasions, then the employer does not have to offer that worker the additional hours.  That would be perfectly legitimate.  The Labour Court would not oppose that.<\/p>  <p>  We are in danger of overly complicating it.

If I am wrong about that, there is a very easy answer that has been pointed out by everybody; the Minister should withdraw her amendment tonight and introduce an amendment in the Seanad to deal with it being too broad, if that is indeed the case, thereby resolving the issue.  Otherwise she has to make an argument as to why she is in favour of the right of employers not to give surplus hours to appropriately qualified part-time employees.  I do not think she wants to make that argument, but that is the effect of the amendment she is proposing which reinforces the system of control and power for the employer relative to the employee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100073#AAAA00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1531342500,"counter":661,"content":"<p>In the trade unions' experience older workers and those with longer service will continue to be discriminated against as employers choose to hire new workers on lesser terms and conditions of employment rather than allow their existing staff to utilise the extra hours when available.  This leads to an increase in low-paid precarious work, an area in which Ireland is one of the worst offenders in the EU.  For example, more than 85% of Dunnes Stores workers say that allocation of hours is used as a control mechanism over them.  This provision is vital if we are to tackle that scourge.<\/p>  <p>  The removal of the commitment on employers to offer additional hours to existing part-time employees results in the State's continued and growing requirement to support these workers via supplementary welfare payments, such as family income supplement, and increase the number of employees who categorise themselves as underemployed for welfare purposes.  We have to accept that we have the second highest level of underemployment in the EU 15 with 147,000 workers stating they are underemployed.  That is to say they would like more hours or full-time work.  This amendment deals with that.<\/p>  <p>  I and other Deputies would be happy to get together tomorrow afternoon if the Minister withdrew the amendment to try to work out an amendment to deal with some of the issues raised regarding similar job specifications, skills or qualifications.  The WRC and the Labour Court are well experienced to know when someone comes in with a grievance or takes a case against an employer and it is a nurse versus a porter.  That would not be accepted in the Labour Court.  They know the job specifications, qualifications and skills that would have to work around that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100073#AAAA00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1531342500,"counter":662,"content":"<p>The Minister has two minutes to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100073#AAAA00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1531342500,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I do not think I need two minutes just to reiterate what I have already said.  I refer back to the two specific items that two Deputies raised.  The penalisation provisions in the Organisation of Working Time Act, as amended by this Bill, will protect Dunnes Stores workers.  There is already protection under the industrial relations legislation against penalisation of workers for being trade union activists.  Every activation measure we take in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is to try to help people who are underemployed be more employed if that is what they want.  All the supports and services available from the Department, whether it is working family payment or jobseeker's payment on a three by two basis, are provided to facilitate a minimum standard of living.<\/p>  <p>  The most important thing for us to do is to ensure people have as much work as they possibly can.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure people who are in precarious work have more stability and security.  While I do not have a difficulty in principle with the amendment made on Committee Stage, it would have required me to go back to public consultation.  We probably would have had to go back to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We would have had to consult all the Deputy's favourite best friends, IBEC, ISME, the retail sector, Mandate and Patricia King of ICTU.  We would have had a full conversation on the actual implications of what a properly worded, detailed prescriptive amendment would mean to the people who would be impacted before we could have brought it back here.  Then I would have had to go to the Attorney General to have it drafted and present it to Cabinet again.  The Bill has dragged on for far too long.  As Deputy Brady said, if we had &euro;1 for every time we mentioned Dunnes Stores in this Chamber in the past couple of months, we would all be rich.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100073#AAAA00500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1531342500,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Everyone except the workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100073#AAAA00600","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1531342500,"counter":665,"content":"<p>Many people are genuinely waiting for us to pass this legislation.

These amendments have been brought forward for essentially the same reasons as amendments Nos. 3 and 4, which related to the penalisation provisions being introduced into the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.  The Attorney General has advised deleting the amendment carried by the committee because it creates two different standards of proof in the same legislation, resulting in legal uncertainty and a penalisation provision which would be unworkable in practice.  Deputies will see from the material circulated that the WRC and the chairman of the Labour Court had also acknowledged the difficulties this will cause.<\/p><p>It is important that we have robust penalisation provisions in both the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, and the two Acts this Bill seeks to amend are as stated.  The penalisation provisions are core to each of the other elements that we are bringing in through this Bill and we are introducing new rights and strengthening existing rights.  It is vital that employees believe they can exercise those rights without any repercussions.  It is important, therefore, that we get the penalisation provisions right.<\/p><p>The penalisation provisions being introduced in this Bill mirror those that exist in the Protection of Employment (Agency Work) Act 2012.  This is the strongest penalisation provision in Irish employment law and it includes threats of penalisation so an employee who is successful in a penalisation claim under the 1997 Act can obtain up to two years of salary in compensation.<\/p><p>The new section 26A introduces a number of additional elements into the penalisation provisions of the 1997 Act which are unnecessary, inappropriate and somewhat confusing.  The net effect of the amendment would be a weakened and flawed penalisation provision.  Section 26 provides for the broad definition of the term &quot;penalisation&quot; and subsection (5) provides that penalisation should include transfers of duty, change or locations of places of work and the reduction in the wages as a change of working hours.  Section 26A purports to provide that penalisation shall be taken to have occurred where an employee, only after a complaint has been made to the WRC, has their hours of work reduced unless the reduction can be objectively justified by the employer.  The new section is not necessary because a change in the working hours in section 26(5) would include any reduction in working hours and in fact the existing section 26(5) is a broader and more comprehensive protection for employees.  For example, an employer could penalise an employee on only a 12-hour week contract by forcing that employee to work a shift of 12 hours on Christmas Eve completely against their will.  That would not be captured by the amendment carried on Committee Stage as it only deals with a reduction in hours.  Furthermore, the new section 26A introduces the defence of objective justification.  This defence is generally applied in age discrimination cases under equality legislation.  To import this language from a statute serving a different purpose and use it for penalisation is not appropriate.<\/p><p>Section 26A goes on to introduce a second standard of proof by providing that it shall be for the employer to show that such justification existed.  Again, we do not think it is necessary and it only serves to cause confusion and undermine the original penalisation provisions.  It could also leave the WRC or the Labour Court open to judicial reviews.  Which section does the adjudication office or the Labour Court rely on when deciding a complaint?  Is it section 26A or section 27(3)?  Whichever it is, its decision would be open to challenge on the basis that it did not rely on the other section, regardless of the substance of the decision.  Employers intent on circumventing the penalisation provisions could challenge any decision of an adjudicating officer or the Labour Court on this basis, rendering what should be strong employee protection provisions completely ineffective.<\/p><p>I really appreciate that this was not the intention of the Deputies who brought forward the amendments on Committee Stage or of the committee in agreeing the amendment.  However, it would be genuinely be an unintended consequence if the provision remains in the Bill and I hope all Deputies can see the difficulty and agree to remove it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100075#CCCC00100","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531343400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531343400,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p><blockquote>In page 16, to delete lines 20 to 26.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100075#CCCC00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531343400,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531343400,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p><blockquote>In page 17, after line 35, to insert the following:<div>&ldquo;PART 7<br \/><br \/>MISCELLANEOUS<\/div><b>Designation<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>20. <\/b>(1) It shall be an offence for an employer to incorrectly designate an employee as self-employed.(2) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.<br \/><br \/>(3) Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or connivance of any person, being a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate, or a person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, that person shall, as well as the body corporate, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished as if he or she were guilty of the first-mentioned offence.<br \/><br \/>(4) Summary proceedings for an offence under this section may be brought and prosecuted by the Workplace Relations Commission.<br \/><br \/>(5) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this section the court shall order the person to pay to the Workplace Relations Commission the costs and expenses, measured by the court, incurred by the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to the investigation, detection and prosecution of the offence unless the court is satisfied that there are special and substantial reasons for not so doing.<br \/><br \/>(6) In proceedings for an offence under this section, it shall be a defence for the accused to prove that he or she exercised due diligence and took reasonable precautions or any person under the control of the accused to ensure that this designation was correct.<br \/><br \/>(7) Notwithstanding section 10(4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851, summary proceedings for an offence under this Act may be instituted within 12 months from the date of the offence.<br \/><br \/>(8) An employee is a person who in performing his or her duties does so as a person not in business on their own account and who is not a free agent or economically independent of the person engaging his or her service.
